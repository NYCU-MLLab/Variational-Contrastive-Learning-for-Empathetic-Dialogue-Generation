are you fine now ?
cool : ) is your car damaged a lot ?
that ' s funny , hope he didn ' t give you a heart attack .
i would probably scream also .
wow ! that sounds amazing . where are you going ?
you are going to love it i am sure . safe travels !
that ##s horrible , hope he is ok .
i see , glad he is ok .
hi , how are you ?
that was kind of you , i am sure they appreciated that !
my last vacation went horribly wrong ##q !
yes i love to re ##mini ##ce
im sorry to hear that . i have never had a dog . what was your experience of the dog ?
i am really sorry to hear that . what was the dogs name ?
hello how are you and what is your story chat about today ?
om ##g wow . . . . i hope you got it open quick !
hi , a few months ago , my mother found some stray dogs that were starving , so she told us about them . of course , we brought the poor babies to our house , a mother dog and her two pup ##pies . my heart went out to them , as their ribs were showing , but they were still so loving and sweet .
yes , i really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them . we already had several pets , so i wasn ' t going to keep them , but i wanted to help them get better and find them a good home . we did for all of them , with the pup ##pies being able to stay together .
that is really nice to see . . . i bet it made you feel good ! so sweet .
nice to still see that behavior in today ##s world . : )
that ##s sweet that you remember that , how old were you ?
i won ##t make you reveal your age ! lo ##l : p
that ' s wonderful . how long have you guys been dating ?
time flies by pretty fast . could be together 10 years from now !
cong ##rat ##ual ##tions . what do you do ?
oh wow . we ' re practically neighbors .
how big was the deck ?
wow that is big .
what is scary about what she is doing ? i ' m not quite understanding what you mean .
oh wow , i can see why you ' re worrying . you should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon .
that ##s great . did you create the script ?
i love google . it is my favorite search engine .
that ##s wonderful news ! its such a nasty disease ! how long has he been clear ?
well i hope he has 100 more years to go ! : )
have you tried to call her ?
maybe give her space .
what births ##tone is it .
what births ##tone is it ?
i love to play madden .
yes , every day .
where is she ?
just give her space .
that ##s great .
did you teach her ?
did you stay and ride it out ? i bet it was quite a thing to see !
that must be so much fun . i have never surf ##ed but love to be on a boat .
wow i hope i am fit enough at 70 to surf !
wow , 4 children my first is on the way and i ' m freaking out . you must have great friends .
thank you . that is our next step we are moving from nyc to miami after the baby . how can we find friends like yours ?
i see what you mean about a parents group . i joined a dad ##s group in facebook and it ' s full of people who complain non stop about being an adult .
that sounds fun , i was never any good at painting
that probably helps a good deal !
i wish i had a rubber bumper to ram those people with !
that is terrible , he could have hurt the horse !
nice , congratulations . how are you liking the new job itself ?
awesome , i hope the job goes great for you !
that ##s sad , hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you
ha ##ha that ##s crazy , i hope they became best friends , i love cats .
i can imagine ! that extra set of hands - - and a person you can * trust * - - that ' s the best !
does she live far away ? it sounds like maybe visits aren ' t too frequent .
an hour ? damn for somewhere as me ##h as denny ' s that really isn ' t worth it .
i haven ' t been there in so long for that exact reason .
oh really ? what happened that made you look bad ?
o ##of ye ##a that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over .
that ' s awesome ! my experience was quite opposite as i sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1 / 2 hour procedure !
yes ! i ' m actually glad it ' s over : ) so , how long did it take you to fix the computer problem ?
yeah , that is pretty annoying to have happen .
good man ! that is your money and they just wanna snatch from you .
it sounds like you ' re happy for her , which is com ##men ##dable given you didn ' t get hired . were you very disappointed ?
that ' s always tough . it ' s so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that . are you happy where you ' re currently at , or still looking ?
i ' m so sorry about that . it sounds like you ' re doing your best to be supportive .
she ' s very lucky to have you . i wish you guys the best !
i am very nos ##tal ##gic too , that must be a fun time !
that is true , but it is part of life , but it is cool to see things again , regain perspective
i ' m sure it did ! it ' s not easy to have to adapt to another person ' s habits .
yes , sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things . it sounds like you have done a great job !
i believe you are really sad although it ' s a fact of life
true , and the good thing is that when the kids grow , they provide moral support to parents .
maybe she did and remembered last minute . you should ask her !
next year i would just forget her birthday all together !
is he a stay at home father , or does he just not want to work ?
i am sorry to hear that . maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work .
must of been pretty surprised , also great to have friends like that .
that must of just made everything even better !
that is a great news . you surely have done a great job .
you are very lucky
no i haven ' t actually , i recently just canceled my netflix service ! i have been thinking about res ##ub ##sc ##ri ##bing though .
i could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time , but if i do i will definitely check it out !
was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet ?
oh ! wow that must of been pretty obvious then .
ar ##gh ! that ' s tough ! have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology ? it can be easy to be defensive in those situations , which of course only makes it worse !
what ' s your approach ? does humor ever work . . . . ? you know , like wearing a dun ##ce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers ? or going john cu ##sack and holding a boom ##box overhead , playing " your " song ?
you should not be so ins ##ecure like that .
what is about them ? do you think he is better than you ?
yes , several times . the place is magical .
well , you are about to have the fun of your life , but gamble responsible .
why . did you started dating recently or something
the most important thing is what you want .
really ? ? are you famous then ? what is your name ?
are you still competing on a professional level ?
not the ta ##cos ! ! ! ! seriously , i can understand how frustrating that is . especially when you have the taste for something . . . . . then gone !
even worse . i ' m so sorry . what did you do instead ?
laughing * and * crying for you ! next time !
i wish i could em ##otic ##on this whole thing . . . . . a string of cry - laughing . i wish i could treat you to lunch there !
i have not ! i used to run a lot for soccer practices . have you ?
that ' s great for her .
ha ##ha ##ha that ##s funny why are you still afraid of the dark ?
o ##oo so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that ' s why your scared ?
that ' s probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place . were you happy with your results ?
sometimes it ' s the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it . good for you !
i feel the same way when i ' m away from my cat . does he have to travel a lot for work ?
maybe one day if you have the time , you can pay him a surprise visit .
that is good . where you running late
that sucks . i hate when i am running late i always feel behind
i don ' t think you should feel bad , you didn ' t know !
i ' m sure he will be okay . maybe you can make it up to him .
sounds like a good idea .
aw . children will make us do things we never thought we would ( or could ) do !
that is so exciting ! congratulations ! you are a fabulous role model for your son .
oh that ' s so sweet . my grandmother is a great person too and i ' m glad to know her .
i think it ' s great that you have such positive memories of her , that way she ' ll always be there in some form .
yes , i love to visit the zoo !
what were some of your favorite things to do back in highs ##cho ##ol ?
that is wonderful ! . it is always nice to have at least one good parent .
my mom was pretty awesome too ! i ' m glad you had a good one as well .
that is bad . are you still afraid a lot ?
you need to fight your fear
wow that ' s very sad ! i am really sorry !
well i guess if that is something you enjoy . i can ' t say that i have al ##ot of friends . mostly my friends are family
yes i do actually , i was almost in an accident because of rain at night once .
i ' m glad you were okay and nothing bad happened .
oh that was so nice of them ! i bet you were relieved !
i bet , losing your phone causes all kinds of stress !
okay that ' s good to know . hopefully you pass the test and i hope you studied .
very nice man . let me know your exam results when they ' re released !
oh no ! i ' ll bet that made you feel terrible !
i can see why not ! i ' m so sorry that happened to you .
that is hilarious . i bet .
oh my just the opposite lo ##l
oh wow ! congratulations ! that is wonderful .
i do not yet but hope to one day . i think you will be a great parent !
wow yes it is
he probably stored that up for his energy for the race
ha ##ha oh wow , how was that for them
that ##s great , im glad she did well
i hate it when that happens ! were you ok ?
i always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens .
that sounds nice ! did you have fun
i ' m glad you enjoyed yourself , it is important to make time for family .
i ' m sorry to hear you ' re having to deal with that
sounds like the best thing to do honestly
you will survive , and you have something to look forward to
i hope your work day goes by fast
oh wow that is so scary . i can ' t believe he asked someone so young to do that .
i really hope you didn ' t have any lasting effects from the injury ?
wow ! i ' m sorry to hear that . do you think you will get an a this time ?
congratulations ! studying can be hard , but sometimes it ' s about technique rather than time spent . are you doing anything different this time ?
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! i hate when that happens !
u ##gh ! that ' s the worst ! too bad you couldn ' t run home and change !
oh that sounds so scary !
i hate snakes ! they are like little evil creatures .
don ' t even t ##lak about diet ##s . i miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
u ##gh . so boring . what wrong with being fat . at least they are all happy .
yes , i have an associate ' s in nursing .
yes , it ' s been a great career . how exciting for you to be about yours . congratulations !
holy smoke ##s ! let me guess , better for the environment ?
you poor soul ! i ' m all for saving the planet , but you have to draw the line somewhere . i hope you get some relief !
but that is an awesome grade ! you should be so proud ! ! !
oh , it ' s been years since i ' ve taken an exam ! perhaps the last one was a para - pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn ' t even give me the grade - it was a pass / fail type exam ( the horror of not knowing the grade though ! ! )
i love the auto ##bahn .
yes i use to own an audio .
i have never done that , good job .
you should . when is the next one .
oh wow that ##s cool .
that ##s good you still think of him .
that ##s cool . was it hard ?
wow that is a lot .
what do you get from your mom ?
i don ' t like un ##in ##vite ##d guests either ! so annoying !
i love dal ##mat ##ians .
how old was she .
well maybe it is but it could also just be she ' s spoiled .
does she have like some other issues like mentally ?
i have a pair of fuzzy slip ##pers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in .
that is the worse , you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they disco ##nti ##nu ##e making them that is the worst , happens to me all the time .
so did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had , or have you been unsuccessful ?
wow , did they notice ?
they will forget about it soon .
i am so sorry to hear that . what did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there ?
that ' s the worst ! you think you can trust people , and then they stab you in the back . i don ' t blame you for not wanting to see them again .
that is great . that should be good insurance . are you general ##y happy with it ?
that is nice . good luck with the su ##ger ##y .
i love colorado , my favorite state .
i wish i could live there .
did you far ##t ?
did they smell ?
did anyone get hurt ?
that ##s good , as long as no one got hurt .
no training at all ! wow , that ' s pretty impressive . how far is a marathon ?
that ' s still pretty impressive . i bet he was proud of himself also ! does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him ?
wow - he certainly is adventurous and determined . i bet he will do amazing .
wow you are brave .
i bet you drove fast .
oh my ! that sounds exciting for sure ! i couldn ' t do it , i don ' t think .
have you ever done anything else so frightening ?
i would say that you ' re an adventurous person . me , i ' m more laid back and mel ##low . ku ##dos to you and have fun !
at least you did it . lance armstrong did not learn until he was 13 .
love , it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me .
yes not if i can just calm the nerves for this sky ##di ##ving trip .
hope so . i don ' t do well with heights .
oh , i bet that was very stress ##ful and difficult . i hope you did well on it ?
well , at least you didn ' t go down in your grade . but , it wasn ' t right to treat the students like that !
that is good , how old are you ?
i am 31 so same generation .
oh go ##sh , i am sorry . did you let the pizza place know ?
wow ! in that instance , i would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like i knowing ##ly fed you bad food .
and did you knock it out of the park ?
perhaps be less cocky next time ? either way b ' s get degree ' s .
was he okay ? i ' ve never heard of that going wrong .
that ' s where you went wrong lo ##l . i ' m glad he was fine . i would ' ve been scared if it were one of my kids too . surgery is still surgery .
oh , i bet that could be frightening for your dogs . did you try to complain to them ?
i think they have some left ##over fireworks that they don ' t want to sit on . they should just use them next time .
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision .
she had a happy life . i ' m sure she understands .
sounds nice . how long has it been since you ' ve seen her ?
oh wow . that is a long time . do you live far apart ?
that ' s awesome ! what did they talk about ?
fascinating ! what kind of work do you do ?
sounds like it was very exciting !
me too ! i also ii ##ke staying home all day .
i have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix al ##ot . i stay home with my little one year old during the day .
i hate when that happens ! i look forward to those all day you know ! did you find out who the cu ##lp ##rit was ?
i think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime !
it happens to everyone , are you out of it now ?
oh well , it was nice to have someone to help you .
i don ' t like them at all . i ' ve seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
yeah that is terrifying . the smaller country fairs are worse . i bet they have no one really checking up on them except the car ##ney folk .
yeah , and the people in charge don ' t get paid enough to always check up and repair them
i bet you were , i did that to my husband when i was young . i thought it was the solution to relief from abuse .
i guess that was what you call a temporary situation . sometimes moving on is required .
don ' t you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
don ' t you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
probably the mid to late 90s . this is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when i first heard brittany spears hit me baby one more time song . it changed my life
sure i did ! it takes deter ##mation to succeed
so if not by studying , what else ?
that must have hurt a lot . did you go to the hospital ?
you are very accident prone . you should get an insurance right away .
that is so true . and sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time !
oh my goodness ! once things settle down i will give you the info about our cruise . it will help you relax like it did me !
sounds so exciting . what did he plan ?
when and how ? are you flying or driving ? just because or is it your anniversary ?
that ' s too funny . you know , i ' m the exact same way . . i get so nos ##tal ##gic with my old things . can never throw them away !
yes , someday . . . ha ##ha . i love looking back at those kinds of things . it brings back so many good memories . such a good feeling
i ' m sorry to hear that . were you two very close ?
that ' s sweet , i had the same experience with my own grandma too . god bless y ' all !
wow , that must have been challenging for everyone ! was he okay ultimately ? was someone able to help him ?
that is frightening ! hopefully nothing you ' ll have to deal with again !
what was the initial talk ?
so how do you feel when lonely ?
maybe she does not have the hot ##s for you anymore .
yes , i understood the first time .
i know the feeling . once i fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though i was hurt ,
oh really ? i haven ' t seen that in an animal as of yet . that ' s pretty interesting .
oh dan ##g , talk about a fall ! if i were your cat i ' d be embarrassed too ! lo ##l
that is a hilarious intro , thank you for that ! so were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous ? ( and you ' re very insight ##ful + intelligent if you say yes ! though being both of those things , you have nothing to worry about ; - ) )
these references are perfect . and your girlfriend must enjoy you very much . maze ##l to ##v , you crazy kids !
is that good or bad ? why the concern ?
ok why do you think so ?
indeed . it makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
i think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another , we would not have much problem
well you should try to study more and see what happens
well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethin ##f
that is terrifying . until the end of your story . . then i laughed so hard i cried . but that is so re ##lat ##able . i ' ve been terrified of my own shadow more than once .
that ' s hilarious , but i also feel bad for you . perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie ?
ha ##ha hey i would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when i was scared , especially during storms .
i ' m supposed to wait for you to start . : )
you haven ' t said anything yet other than asking why i hadn ' t responded . sorry i ' m a little lost as to what i was supposed to respond to ?
really ? where do you live at ?
i feel your pain . i live in orlando , florida . so im in the same boat .
that is so annoying . who he thinks he is ? ? ?
i would be scared of a guy like that .
aw ##w . . . sorry to hear that . i haven ' t personally seen the show . what hit you the most ?
sounds like a touching but sad story . love without two ways interaction is really hard . i can ' t imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly . .
you mean nos ##tal ##gic ?
what your grand father did to you was very special .
that is not very consider ##ate or respectful , plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street .
i live in the country , so i do not have neighbors that live close .
i sometimes get freaked out , but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors .
yes . peace is key .
uh ##mm ##nn ! cut down on the intake
you need to see a dentist then
just all the time . who does not ?
it depends on the machine you are working on .
do you have a tribal tattoo . how does it look like ?
that was bad . you can try some tattoo removal tool
did you know them well ? you must be very trusting .
i think i would have just said i didn ' t have any cash and let that be the end of it .
sorry ! try harder next time !
never late you know !
that sucks . are they mad or what ?
it ' s kinda annoying to me when people don ' t call you back .
serious ? why are you scared when you are in a wreck ?
wow , you really have to be careful dear .
yes i have , it feels really bad when it happens .
ye ##a it can be quite embarrassing to look back on .
come on , you do not have to be jealous of your brother
you can learnt some skills from your brother . maybe it will help
are you trying to go out and meet some ladies
that is the first step . what you have to do next is be at your best behavior always
do you work in the tech industry ? you could always take a class .
there ' s ton ' s online , and knowing more about computers can really help any profession .
i am sure it is something disgusting . do you have someone do it around you
you can just let him know you are not comfortable with it
yes the patient is very ill
oh that is really a bad news i hear ##ed
what is it that you would like to share with me ? i am very interested to hear about it !
whoa , i hope you win ! you never know , it could be your lucky day !
i know how you feel , i get so scared when exams come up , its so hard sometimes
ye ##a open book make you think you don ##t need to study but that isn ##t true at all
hi
cool , i could not do english .
ye ##a that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it ?
o ##oo well that explains a lot . well hopefully he will pass some to you
which work are you talking about . it is always a good feeling to get things done . there a way your brain reward you with good feeling
oh yes , i do most times . who does not
i say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered .
yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure .
do you think you can win the lottery
then why do you want to risk your money on such thing . why not buy yourself a nice shoe instead
i am very glad to hear that . do you have any children ?
i have no kids , but would love to have some at some point !
yes i do
i feel hopeful that i am going to recover from a mental dos ##ir ##der
that sounds terrible . why didn ' t he come ?
ah i see . i don ' t really talk to my brother much .
that seems pleasant . i am currently in my chair working !
i need some good rest , myself . sleep is so important !
awesome ! that ##s exciting . what college are you applying at ?
that ##s awesome ! i wish you the best of luck in your future studies !
what is so interesting about the series
i see . are you excited about seeing the movie
congratulations on getting your job we should go celebrate !
as long as the cake is fun ##fe ##tti i am more than there
wow , are they going to pay for it ?
you have some very nice parents , when i graduated my parents said pay us more rent now .
that ##s a really good idea , that sounds like it would be hard to sleep though
im glad it turned out well or i hope so .
as it should . however those things happen to everyone it is a part of life .
hopefully something better happens when we die and our lives will go on in a better way .
i ' m glad you enjoyed it . was it a wedding ?
that ' s wonderful . i am going to a wedding next week !
i understand . i remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks . they made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didn ' t even read .
yeah , i had my commodore 64 and amiga in the late 80 ' s . still , the games were great when they worked !
how wonderful . what sort of dog ?
a fluffy white one ? how amazing !
how old is he ?
that sounds amazing ! what do you think you ' re gonna do there ?
i ' ve been one time but i was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring . that sounds like a great time though , i ' m happy for you !
that ' s unfortunate . some people just cannot help but act rude .
that ' s unfortunate . what do you think about uber ?
that is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first f will also be his last .
for ##ni ##te has surely caused many kids grades to drop .
that was so bad . what kill the diver
it means he mis ##cal ##cula ##ted the time he was to spend under the water . sorry for him
why did u leave your luggage for a stranger
wa ##o , its a mistake ,
that ' s intense . i hope you do as well as possible !
keep up the great work . pass that exam with flying colors .
yeah , sometimes i want to just stop going to work . i hate t ##ps reports so much !
yeah , bill lumber ##gh is the worst boss ever . he kept calling me every day when i just wanted to sleep instead of work !
i love cats , just hold it between your arms , it will be okay
that ##s better , but sorry for the disappointment she had caused
wow that is amazing i went there back in 2000 . you are in for a big treat . make sure to get french bread .
also the mcdonald ' s taste way better there than in the us if your looking for good cheap food .
you need to be patient . getting promoted at your work place takes patience and per ##se ##verance
your hopes are high . it means you have a good chance of getting it . and i hope you have the requirement too ?
wow ! it looks great that you feel achieved
cong ##rat ##s doctor ! ! your parents would have been proud of you
sorry to hear that you did not get approved .
you are right about that . owning a car can get expensive .
my dream car is a chevy cam ##aro .
classic 1975 would be great .
do you still have them ?
do you own any other pets now ?
wow . did you get hurt ? sounds scary .
i am always scared about those air ##bags ! i am so glad you are ok !
oh my goodness , that ' s horrible . who was she ?
that ' s horrible , i hope you are okay and are recovering from that .
no , i don ' t feel surprise d
yes , i am
i ' m glad too . what made it swell up anyway ?
oh i get that , i had that happen near one of my wisdom teeth too .
wow , it was because you were young , that is why
it is really nothing , children behave like that sometimes
what did you pass ?
that ' s great ! i bet you feel relieved .
i am so happy for you . i know how it feel when you are stranded
you can collect her contact and make friend with her
i didn ' t understand you
that is bad . how could you forget ?
i only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me . the rest of my friends don ' t really care about me that much .
yeah , we have to watch out for ourselves . at least we won ' t let us down , lo ##l .
that ' s great news to hear . i hope things continue to stay great for you .
i agree . i think that difficult times are best navigate ##d with a calm mind .
i hope it doesn ' t rain . where are you going ?
that ' s great . i have been there before . it used to be a spring break hot ##sp ##ot .
oh no ! that ' s not very nice but i guess you can play it off by just acting cool and laughing it off .
it ' s okay it ' s pretty funny , and it ' ll be forgotten about so quick any ##how . i know how it feels ha ##ha , we all do .
oh , really , that ' s so brave of him
ok , where did he travel to ?
yi ##kes ! schools get really mad about that , as well as it makes the kid worry .
don ' t beat yourself up . it happens all the time . i am sure you are a loving parent !
that is awful . was anyone else hurt ?
were there any signs that the driver might have been imp ##are ##d , as opposed to the breaks mal ##fu ##nction ##ing ?
i hope the child recover ##s from her injuries .
oh wow , how did you feel about that ?
how fast were they going ?
oh how nice , how long are you staying ?
that sounds exciting i hope you have a lot of fun !
that ' s refreshing to hear , i ' m happy for you . i rarely hear that people are satisfied with their partner .
wow , what really happened ?
oh really , that was he ##ctic for you i guess
you need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam
do you get enough sleep . being sleep deprived can make you lose focus
what are you expecting ? are you pregnant ?
oh nice well happy birthday
were you up when he got home ?
i can understand your position . how old is he ?
is she a model ?
oh , so what does a " sitting " en ##tail ?
who are you talking about ? what happened ?
that is bad . i hope you see her in another event .
ye ##a i know that feel , outside of a few people i knew nearly know one and avoided lots of people cause no one cared
it can be really frustrating , seems like so many people have it good while so many have the short end of the stick
yeah , but very few .
most of my friend have had in the past just wanted to benefit from our relationship , it was not genuine .
that ' s great . i ' m trying to get a girlfriend right now : /
yeah they are . it makes me sad too man .
did you get a car as a gift ? that ' s exciting .
that is so nice of her ! that ' s really really generous .
i think there must be a reason for that
oh , that ##s life , so sorry for that
what makes you say that ?
do you have a large network of friends and family ?
somewhat , iv ##e felt better these past couple months than i usually have
yes definitely , makes me feel like im doing so ##em ##thing good and helps me get better looking and health ##ier
what was bad about it ?
did you get a new phone ?
yes , it is important . what happened ?
that is bad and difficult to live . sorry to hear that .
i am so sorry to hear that , that is a real bum ##mer . were you injured ?
that is absolutely awful ! how long did it take for your ankle to heal ?
wow , what did you do to deserve the car ?
that ##s int ##rest ##ing , you must be very happy now
you should find something interesting to do .
go hand out with friends or host a night over sleep , that would be fun .

that ' s good . . . . i did well too
so , did you get it ?
that is cool . definitely you will
wow , and you didn ' t get pulled over ?
must ' ve been some important meeting !
i don ' t know what fl ##og ##ging is .
looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten , so unless you mean you were beaten metaphor ##ically , you shouldn ' t be " wow ##ing " me .
well done , what type of performance was it ?
was it a ballet . i enjoy watching dance performances .
what did she surprise you with ?
amazing ! that ##s really nice
what do u want to eat ?
ok , have u prepared it ?
normal is the best way , it helps the mother bond with the child
we are adamant to have our baby born normal . i have seen first hand the cs mothers and their closeness ( lack of ) with their kids
you think so ?
well , i ' ve kept quite a few relationships throughout my life . if i actually wanted to look at online profiles , i do it mostly for research or investigative purposes . other than that , i ' m only interested in online chat .
why , what do you have planned ?
sounds like fun ! i hope you find the money to do it .
great ! you must be well prepared . are you nervous ?
yes it sounds like you did everything right . i hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer .
did you get what you needed ?
well that ' s better than nothing at all : )
oh no , i ' ve had a few days like that . did you laugh it off ?
well good on you for tough ##ing it out . your the stronger for it .
what kin of food was it ?
i love pasta
wow that must feel good
that is great
how nice
wow that is very nice
that sucks . sometimes it doesn ' t matter if you ' re surrounded by people , you can still feel alone
the hardest lesson in life is that we ' re all alone
awesome . what type of music was played there ?
oh my god . that ' s so cool . hope the ticket was not expensive ?
who came back with a gold medal ?
oh , nice . well , if you work upon on something , anything is possible if you work upon it .
hello friend ! may i ask what it that you feel that way about ?
i don ' t understand what you are talking about . are you feeling okay today ?
of course , like they say happiness is con ##tag ##ious , if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young
also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
wow that must be lot of preparation
where is this event going to be
that ' s amazing . it ' s good to give your head a rest so that you will recall all the items easily when you are at the exam center
i wish you all the best in the exam
that ##s good , i am not sure if i can ask what happened ?
oh wow , i am glad that you are okay .
om ##g i would have ran faster than forest gum ##p . . . what did you do ?
im glad no one was hurt !
oh no , i ' m sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you .
what was her name ? have you read rainbow bridge ?
what a beautiful name ! hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now .
that ' s great . teachers are so important .
i wanted to become a teacher before . i was afraid of how hard it would be .
well congratulations ! i hope your students appreciate you as much as they should .
oh my goodness , did you go to check what the noise was ?
i ' m glad it wasn ' t anything serious ! it ' s scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios .
that ' s really cool of them . you weren ' t expecting it at all , hu ?
parents can be great sometimes . did you have a good time ?
what did you find ?
i love old school video games . what were your favorites ?
congratulations . interviews can be stress ##ful
that ##s smart . and it worked .
nice . what is his name ?
nice . i like dogs .
oh my that sounds so scary ! was everyone ok ?
do you think you will ever zip line again ?
oh no . what do you do for that ?
oh . how old is he ?
well , i hope you are feeling better . what makes you so nervous ? are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early ?
i ' m sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks . you can work together to make sure it works !
that is very cool ! how much did it cost ?
wow , sounds nice ! was it hard to do the work ?
dan ##g , that really stink ##s . why did they quit so quickly ?
perhaps you should screen new employees better ? like give them a physical performance test ?
i hope it ' s nice for you . do you have any alternate plans ?
well , that ' s always a problem for me too , but at least you ' ve got another $ 1 . 25 now .
i think that is wonderful , it ' s about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option .
no , but as mark twain once said , the law is an ass .
i ' m glad they made the right decision eventually though . it ' s about time !
the cool ##est race i saw was late at night on the highway out of town .
yeah , it can be pretty dangerous , but i was young .
i ' m sorry to hear that . how long did you have him ?
i bet pets are amazing . they ' re hard to replace once they ' re a part of the family
o ##oo ##h , that ' s rough . did you make him mad ?
well , i hope you can work things out at least
flying has seemingly become terrible these days . what about your trip was so bad ?
that sounds frustrating and a little scary . did you eventually make it to your destination ?
that ' s too bad . but better safe than sorry .
not too much . i used to fly a lot but not anymore . i stick around home now mostly .
well , have you tried re ##li ##ving that through the pokemon app that you can interact with ?
yes , i can understand that . . sometimes nothing compares . . have you guys played recently ?
i know how that feels . i bet it was boring and lonely .
did you get out and do anything ?
that really is a big change for you ! are you excited to have some more down time ?
yeah , that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face !
was it a long flight ? or was there lots of tu ##rb ##ula ##nce ?
ah , i can ' t imagine being up in the air that long ! sounds like it was a boring flight too .
i guess that is one positive !
did you study hard ?
no , you should keep studying .
that stink ##s , it ' s never worth giving up though ! what line of work do you prefer ?
i can definitely believe that . . i hope something opens up for you soon !
what was so fun ?
oh yeah ! ! ! i love taking my dog too , she gets to get all that dan ##g energy out before i bring her back to our little apartment !
that sucks , i love dogs .
yes i am sure she it .
wow . . that is horrific ! i ' m so glad you ' re okay . . was anyone else hurt ?
awesome . i am so glad to hear that . . always good to hear the stories were someone gets away ! !
i agree with that ! i just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday ! makes me so mad . . .
i mean i like the rain at certain times . . but not when i ' m trying to do fun stuff outside !
that is such a brilliant idea , are you excited about it ?
that ' s awesome , you ' ll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it !
oh wow ! i have heard of that happening to lots of people . did they get arrested ?
yes they do . it has gotten really bad around here with car theft ##s . it ' s no wonder are car insurance rates are so high .
oh really ? what ' d ya get ?
why did he do that ?
math is a tough subject . good for you .
being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you . keep at it .
how exciting that you were able to do that . i hope it was fun .
it ' s funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation .
how ' d it go
that ' s great . do you present often ?
oh no , what happened ?
glad you are safe !
have you talked to her about it ?
that doesn ' t sound too good . has she been like this before ?
was it fun ? interesting ? engaging ?
good ! team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so i ' m glad it worked out for you
did she give you a reason ?
sorry to hear that , i hope you find somebody else in your life .
sorry to hear that . did you lose money ?
so , you never actually lost the wallet .
that sounds amazing ! how did it go ?
that ' s amazing , i have only had one brit ##hd ##ay party like that in my life .
what kind ?
i use to have a g . i joe .
what were they sick from ?
that was nice of you .
i ' ll bet you were surprised . were you glad to see them ?
did you rec ##onne ##ct and promise to keep in touch ?
was she your girlfriend ?
that is great , did you have fun ?
yeah , that ##s rough . i hate having to clean up mess that wasn ' t my fault .
yeah , that sounds annoying . maybe try to sc ##old the dog so they won ' t do it again ?
that sucks . what was his name ?
barney was the name of my ham ##ster .
i know that feeling . it ' s nerve rack ##ing trying to incorporate everything you learned at the d ##m ##v in real time .
it ' s also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time , that would definitely get me nervous .
my wife , loves taylor swift .
that is awesome , i went to high school with brett fa ##vre ! small world .
i am glad you love her , it must be a nice feeling
that is a good thing then
that wasn ' t smart .
why did you then ?
dan ##g . . my old roommate was an engineering student . he always told me how hard it was . what kind of engineering ?
yeah , i think once you get in the field , you ' re set . the jobs seem to pay well . good luck with that , you sound like you know what you ' re doing .
oh , the bus ? yeah i bet that was a little embarrassing . sorry to hear that . i take my car for granted . maybe you will get one someday .
well , keep working at it . it ' s a process .
where has he been ?
oh i bet you are excited then ! he will be happy too !
is there a reason why you didn ' t tell your boss ?
is there a way you could report it anonymous ##ly ?
oh i do too ! i like a nice sunny day .
it ' s been really rainy . my power just went out awhile ago .
yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest .
my brother used to have a yo - yo ! he did a trick called " around the world " and also one called " the cradle . " know those ?
oh yeah ! i remember that ! i wasn ' t good at doing any of them . i mostly just watched him . good memories .
oh man i would have terrified i hate being up so high . he sounds really brave !
did he go on anymore after that ?
well he ' s young , so you can ' t really fault him .
that ' s good . you seem like a great parent .
does it happen often in your part of the country ?
wow . i can only imagine
that ##s nuts .
did she scream ?
did you get to ? what happened ?
i have never been there ! sounds fun , but i don ' t support sea world and the way they treat their animals .
oh go ##sh ! i would burn the whole house down . i ' m terrified of spiders and bugs
i would have a heart attack !
i know how you feel . life is too short .
yes , you do ! just keep living everyday like your last .
wow , i never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place . i sure hope he wasn ' t hurt .
it does sound like an am ##zing feat
oh ##h that ' s rough . . . did you talk to them about it
do they give you any kind of value . . . or do they just ignore you / put you down 90 % of the time ?
is your relative okay now ?
it must ' ve have been . glad they are okay now .
congratulations to him ! you must be proud .
he ' s very lucky to have you .
oh yeah what happened ?
om ##g is he upset ?
so did you help him / her
that ' s pretty nice of you
wow , that ##s a nice car
it happens sometimes i guess
memories . . what state ?
i understand but memories are always nice .
what happened with your car then ?
u ##gh ! that stink ##s ! did you found out who did it ?
i would love that show
oh well , it happens
have you been to the doctor ?
you will be fine then
well that is quite the accomplishment .
he sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder . you must have taught him well .
oh man , that ' s so nerve - wr ##ack ##ing . do you think you guys will be a good fit ?
then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to over ##rea ##ct . i guess you could say you luck ##ed out , but that may be me speaking too prematurely
i hope you make it . that ##s a big birthday .
that not good . maybe she will understand if you just can ' t make it .
wow . . . that would be one of my worst fears . how did they even manage to do that ?
wow ! any way they can get out ? did they call someone ?
i know it is hard to start letting go , but it gets easier with time . don ' t worry , you are not alone .
yeah , they always seem to come back ! you just have to love them from afar for a while .
that ' s really sweet . we don ' t have gas station attendants here . but that ' s nice that they ' re that helpful .
oh ##h , that makes sense . yeah , then that ' s really nice of them ! and really sweet of her to offer a tip . i guess there ' s good in the world after all .
i would absolutely be scared too . good news or bad , i would be a worried wreck beforehand . have you gotten it checked out yet ?
i ' m so glad to hear it was good news , though !
that ##s great of you . life is very unfair but we can go at any minute , so cher ##ish those you love !
it doesn ' t help us no . but you must take care of yourself too - take some time for yourself when being a care ##gi ##ver ok !
coming back to work could be good after a break .
i understand
that isn ' t good .
did anyone help you ?
i wish i could feel that feeling , ( unfortunately , i am a man ) . what did you end up naming your son ?
i am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well . george is such a nice name .
i have - but not for anything that severe . are you suffering any side effects of the stroke ?
yu ##p - i know that feeling . and it ' s always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an iv in your arm .
that really sucks man . are you planning on looking for a new one ?
well , as long as you ' re doing something you enjoy , that ' s all that really matters .
have you figured out what ' s the problem ?
sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent ?
yes ? that ##s so cute , but you have to be careful ##l not to say bad words in fr ##on of them
om ##g , well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them , and also when you are not with them !
are you keeping it as a so ##uven ##ir ?
nice , i do that sometimes with movie tickets if it ' s a great movie that i en ##jo ##ed a lot .
i ' ve been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuff ##y too . where do you usually go ?
oh wow ! i bet the person inside would ' ve po ##oped his pants , but there was probably none left !
what happened ? ? did you guys went camping or something ?
ho , i am sorry to hear that .
too late i already took it . just kidding , did you find it ?
oh , that ' s bad . was there anything important in it ?
wa ##o that ##s so cool you must so excited , how long has it been ?
wa ##o it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son , sorry
oh yeah ? do you have to do that every game ?
that ##s funny . well at least it sounds like you are always prepared .
that ' s cool . i am not a swing ##er either .
how did you do it ?
that makes no sense .
that seems like a good price .
right now it ' s freezing in my home lo ##l i just got out of bed after 30 min ##s of sitting because it ' s cool ##d
ha ##ha i live in virginia where right now the temper ##ture outside is mug ##gy 85 de ##gre ##ss just regular ac pumping in my home
aw man that must suck how do you hu ##ys keep cool through the summer
i ' m sorry , how long has it been ?
that ' s always a tragedy .
that ' s nerve wr ##ack ##ing for sure . how did it go ?
it probably went well , despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people .
oh nice ! how long did you guys stay ?
oh no , what happened ?
oh ye ##a ? where are you guys ? in the mountains ? camping ?
lakes are awesome . a body of water around here is pretty far . how long are you guys staying ?
did you get anything extra , like a bonus or a trip .
great . what business is it ?
i can tell where this is going .
that has never happened to me . thank god !
well does that make you anxious ?
oh , that would be rough . i ' ve been through that too .
are you happy for him ?
but if is a great opportunity for him , you should be happy .
that ' s very nice of the friend . what sort of problem was it ?
ba ##h , those new ##fan ##gled computers . it ' s nice to have a tech sa ##av ##y friend .
why do you think they do that ?
that ' s not fair and probably very frustrating for you . you need to say something to them .
oh man , i can ' t even imagine . i lived in kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage . took out the power all day and stuff . nature can be so devastating sometimes .
je ##ee ##ze , ye ##a , it ' s totally understand ##able to be afraid . has it been good there otherwise ?
it ' s awesome to hear that ! i guess no place can ever be perfect though . here ' s hoping we both can live long , happy , and fulfilling lives !
that must be so disappointing . is there something else you can do to have fun ?
sounds like you really like the water . so what do you do now ?
wow ! i ' ve never been anywhere near there .
i ' ve been to the ocean a few times but i ' ve never even seen a surfer . we had a small boogie board .
i live in tennessee
wow . i must have a boring life then , because i have only seen tug boats and barges on the mississippi .
oh no ! how come ?
oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally . you never know how someone ' s home life is like .
aw well it ' s likely bipolar - i know a ph ##ew . they have a hard time even on med ##s .
i would save some and maybe get something you need / want ?
for sure ! any extra money is always good !
had she done that to you before ?
what a shame !
congratulations !
oh man ! i wish work stress would make me lose weight lo ##l . i gain ! are you looking for a new job ?
oh i don ' t deal with that well . i hope you get a new boss !
wow , what brand
that is a nice car
yeah all the time . i get so jealous
wow , that is hard to do . congratulations my dude !
that sounds awesome ! is el ##bert a fourteen ##er ?
ha ##ha ##ha . well , i hope you don ' t get sick . take something salty with you , maybe that will help . have fun !
congratulations . i bet you ' re happy !
do you work for a company or on your own ?
cool beans
were you able to get it back ?
that ' s great ! i bet that was a relief .
wow , that should have been amazing
me too , i love chocolate
i ' ve always been too scared to do a back ##fl ##ip . i always worry i ' m going to break my neck or something . did it take him a long time to get it right ? and did he get hurt ?
oh , that makes sense . and i ' m glad to hear that . i always worry about that sort of thing . you ever think about trying to do it net ##x ?
are you sick ?
that sucks , i will pray for you .
oh my , that must ' ve been an embarrassing situation !
that ' s ok , you did the right thing . it probably happens to lots of people .
yes , what about it ?
that was nice of him .
tell me all about it .
i try to always go for extra sleep .
wow ! 30th is a big milestone birthday ! i can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you .
did you feel old after ?
that had to be relief . so now you won ' t have to deal with that frustration again .
those keyboard short ##cut ##s can be life ##sa ##vers .
that ##s good . everyone isn ##t so fortunate .
its goo ##f to have support when it does change .
exactly
we would all be better people then
oh wow . bet it felt amazing . was it a mistake ?
sounds like a great day . makes you wish it would happen everyday
that ' s so embarrassing ! what did you do ?
did anyone say anything ?
well at least you got away with it this time !
really ? why was that ?
do you normally feel like that when you fly ?
i can understand that , flying is scary .
i ' m glad you didn ' t get hurt .
hey , do you have anything on your mind ?
i agree , inc ##omp ##ete ##nt customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems .
oh i am so sorry for your loss .
i bet . you gave him a good long life , that was the best you could do .
i am sorry it was so stress ##ful
just hope for the best
u ##gh that ##s the worst right . . everyone should have holidays off .
i say skip work next time : p go for it
i just love that , my son knows as ##l
i wish schools would teach kids as ##l
she wants to spend time with you
that was nice of her
its a beautiful place
in that case i agree then
where are you going on vacation ?
that is close for me , but it is a fun time !
i admire that
no its not
i see , have you tried yoga and meditation ?
keep a positive minds ##et and your an ##xie ##ties will be relieved !
oh my , you must have very surprised !
it must have been an enjoyable day . you have nice friends !
i bet she was so excited ! ! did she love her presents ?
that was me last christmas lo ##l my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
oh no . why are you worried to lose it ?
oh no . . that is a bit scary . i wish the best for you !
i am , thank you for asking !
oh no , why not ? !
they really can ' t . it ' s still no excuse though .
oh that sucks . . . did she explain herself yet
sounds like you need a new friend or your own car . . . or both lo ##l
that ' s terrible . someone should call animal control on them .
i hope they do something to help that poor puppy .
what happened ?
did he end up biting you ? ?
oh no , that ' s terrible ! are both you and your dog alright now ?
yes , that would have frightened me too . i ' m glad he ' s alright now .
i hope and wish so . in this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities
being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress
that is literally the worst , the people should have at ##lea ##st told you to go ahead first !
its really so rude . u ##gh im sorry
i love dogs too what breed do you have ?
i have a german shepard
that ' s awesome . what did it take for you to get there
sounds like you ' ve gotten smarter and more ob ##ser ##vant over the years
oh how gross ! i don ' t like po ##ss ##ums anyway ##s
just lizards and ga ##tors . i live in south florida ha ##ha
i have heard about that game . i heard there was one guy that makes about $ 500 , 000 a month playing it on the streaming service twitch . maybe your son should give it a try .
twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games . i guess a lot of people really love watching good players . go ahead and retire now and get him started !
i ' m sorry your friend moved away . sounds like me when i moved from indiana to florida . my friend was upset when i left too .
that is your friend , you should be happy for them !
aw i am happy for you ! what do you go to school for ?
that is great ! good luck to you !
i bet ! i can ' t imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life .
that ' s awesome : ) i ' m happy for you ! hopefully one day i will get to see that
hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things , right ?
oh . i recommend correct ##ing that before it gets out of hand . good luck !
what movie were you watching ?
that is a great movie .
i do . it feels great to get out into nature doesn ' t it ?
the beach is my most favorite place to go .
that sounds rough , were you able to get accustomed to texas ?
i know what you mean , that happened to me when i left for college a few years ago .
wow that is really confident on your end . are you going to do anything with the girl
that sounds exciting . just make sure she is okay with it all before !
what was she referring to then ?
i see . do you get a lot of storms in your location ?
i always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation
that movie is a classic ! i loved it as a kid !
ha ##ha ##h ! that is awesome !
get them reported
you are welcome , if you take your stand they will behave
i bet you ' re both excited and nervous about it ! i have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade .
i ' m sure it will ! i hope it all works out for you .
that ' s always a good thing . it means you should get on great with your neighbors .
most of my neighbors are good , kind people too , so i know just what you mean .
why did you feel anxious ?
hmm . . i ' m a little confused . why were you anxious ?
well that ' s sweet . how did the policeman react ?
oh wow ! that ' s awesome ! your son sounds like he has a bright future !
i ' ve done that before . getting over that initial fear is really hard . but it ' s fun once you do !
i understand completely . it ' s that initial anxiety . it ' s a scary thing to do !
i bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time .
its always nice when grandma ##s come visit .
oh wow , that sounds like it might be cool but i don ' t know what that looks like , what is the 900 ?
ye ##a , how old is your brother ?
i love camping , and understand why a ham ##mo ##ck is your favorite . they ' re so comfortable !
that sounds amazing , as long as you ' re not reading scary books about the woods !
i agree . camping and ham ##mo ##cks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free .
i ' ve actually never gone there . what ' s it like ?
that ' s good to hear . i do plan on taking my kids in the future !
do you live in fl ##ord ##ia ? i have family down there and was really worried about them .
that was lucky . losing power is bad , but at least that was it . scary situation .
what will happen if the secret is told ?
of course , i only tell them the best ones though !
oh no , was she upset at you or about something else ?
well that ' s really kind of you to help her like that . she ' s lucky to have you !
u ##gh , people can be so rude . was he able to go to the bathroom ?
that ' s awful ! ! so what did you end up doing ? did he just have to pop a squat ?
as long as you work hard and stay dedicated , i ' m sure it will come !
absolutely ! and if you trust your boss , i ' m sure he will do the right thing .
that ##s scary . did you have to pull over ?
i take it you made it out safe bea ##cus ##e we ' re here chatting
that sounds like an awesome christmas present ! i ' ve actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need . where are you going ?
i ' ve always wanted to go on a disney cruise - it ' s probably my dream vacation . i ' m so jealous ! ! !
that ' s such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time . what was your major ?
i totally get that . i major ##ed in business but sometimes i wish i major ##ed in engineering . i ' m kind of glad i didn ' t though . it ' s hard !
aw ##w , that is very nice of them . i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago .
border col ##lie . yours ?
i can imagine ! did you end up having a good flight ?
that ' s good ! hopefully you had a nice seat ##mate too !
aw ##w , was he scared ?
i can see that . school is a challenging time for a kid .
always good to feel ready for something like that . what subject was it in ?
man , i remember those days . my engineering exams were killer . did you do well on it ?
another man ' s trash is another man ' s treasure ! what things do you save ?
i keep a scrap ##book myself ! i love collecting stamps . got any trips planned this year ?
i ' m so sorry that happened to you . how did you handle this situation ?
i hope no one saw that , it must ' ve been terrible .
how are you going to learn ! why are you afraid to go ?
it ain ' t so bad . i ' m sure you ' ll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine .
please describe what scared you about the caves .
that seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves !
is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable ?
i do too but it ' s natural to get en ##vious of others sometimes , don ' t put yourself down over it .
that must be so annoying . i get that sometimes too .
i ' m sad to hear that , i ' m sure there is someone who cars .
that ' s good to hear that you care for your son so much . i am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best .
yeah , my village helped with my son ' s preschool tuition as well . strength in numbers and good neighbors !
oh yu ##ck ! where did that happen ?
during dinner ? ac ##k !
can you tell me about your recent experience ?
yeah , i love star wars . i was sad when han solo died . he was my favorite character !
that would make me sad , did you let him go ?
i know how you feel , i ' m sorry about that , at least he probably came back pretty quickly .
i ' m sure they will understand . you can always have another dinner , that ' s the beauty of life !
where did you end up going ?
oh no , have you look at other options ?
i really hope you get it !
oh no . did you flip him off ?
that was probably for the best anyway . people who drive like that are the worst , though .
wow , that ' s super annoying ! i understand wanting to get things done early , but that ' s not very respectful to neighbors .
have you talked to him about it ?
are you getting laid off ?
im sorry , i hope you ' re able to find an even better job immediately
do you live in florida ?
wow , that sounds terrifying . you are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though .
that ##s amazing , you must be a good person
how many kids do you have ?
sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me . alone can be good .
well at least you didn ' t have a lot of people under foot to slow you down . so i hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it .
i am so sorry to hear that !
that is the worst . at least you and your husband got something worked out for your son ' s first day at school !
a walk down memory lane .
oh i bet ! it ' s always good to cher ##ish those memories .
oh that can be annoying , did you tell him anything ?
ha ##ha ##h that ' s kinda funny . maybe he just missed you !
nice ! where did you go ?
oh , that is really cool ! what a great experience , and fun to bond with your dad !
was it long ?
that ' s long , i understand the reason behind you being upset
i know how you feel , it ' s always good to bond with your buddies when you can
thank god you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them
oh ye ##a , i can relate to the good times , is she still alive ?
oh no . may her soul rest in peace
cong ##rat ##s ! i ' m sure you will have great memories .
i believe you will just continue doing what you ' ve already done .

oh , sorry . that ' s awesome . what does his charity support ?
was the weather nice ?
i can ' t wait until we get nice weather . its too hot to do anything
some people have no concept of being rude .
no , they don ##t .

i really wish i knew what to say , but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 i still don ##t know what to say ! spend a lot of time with your loved ones !
really , isn ' t that unusual ?
i ' m glad it worked out so well for you all .
i know how stress ##ful that can be . i hope everything turned out alright .
that is great news !
that wasn ' t nice . i hope they caught them .
that sucks , how much is it ?
i can relate . you just have to be yourself . do you know if you got the job ?
that ’ s great ! how do you like it ?
is it sunny where you are ?
glad for you , it ' s cloudy and humid here .
why did you wait a week ? tell her to tell him
i don ' t know . you should have told him ##e when it happen ##ded . just do it and get ui ##t out of the way so you both can move past it .
that ' s nice . i always like getting letters .
no , i never did . it might have been nice .
58 million . that ' s unbelievable .
well , you know how to get it from him right ?
ah congratulations on the engagement ! how long have you two been together ?
no problem . i hope she ' ll love it as well .
oh no . did you guys talk about it ?
no one ' s perfect . i hope you won ' t hold a gr ##udge .
how ' d it go ?
being prepared pays off so ##em ##time ##s .
how did you do on it ?
good , well i hope you get the better position !
how strict is the budget ?
ah , that makes sense , well i hope it goes well for you !
nice . did his team finish first ?
at his age , they progress very quickly
that ' s very nice of them ! having caring friends is very important .
what did they do for you ?
i bet it does , you should find a podcast you like
that is smart , i would recommend a nintendo switch !
how so ?
i ' m sorry . any way you can get out of it ?
why ' s that ?
have you always been scared of heights ?
yu ##ck ! you didn ' t get wet and muddy i hope !
that is good to hear . no one likes so ##ggy shoes !
back ##fl ##ip ##s are scary . neck injury is serious .
that ##s good ! they do look cool too .
i was scared the first and only time i flew also . where were you flying to ?
oh wow ! i bet that was really exciting . i have never been out of the country .
you must feel horrible ! get her something extra nice and i am sure she will forgive you !
get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place !
i have the same feeling . i miss her also
sorry to hear that
are you going to have it completed in time ? i hope you are not behind schedule !
ou ##ch ! you better kn ##uck ##le down and burn the midnight oil !

same here . well i hope he can adapt and do well . good luck with your ba too !
wow . that ' s pretty h ##yp ##oc ##rit ##ical .
i think she ' s just trying to cause a problem .
did you not have your own food ?
oh no ! that sounds horrible ! did the co - worker find out ?
oh wow . give me the details .
are you missing an organs ?
well , at least you ' re in one piece . you could have been in several .
not really ? how come ?
oh wow , the bb ##q must be delicious .
that ' s a profound thought . we definitely take america for granted , especially when some people say it ' s in its " worst state in a long time . " we ' re prisoners of the moment .
yeah , i guess you would know for sure , since you ' ve seen it first hand . especially a place like haiti , that ' s just gets pounded with hurricanes . what brought you to haiti , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
i am sorry to hear that . is there a chance you forgot your wallet home ?
that story could become a movie script .
that ’ s a bum ##mer . drink some coffee
try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
is it not going to happen ?
that sucks .
you should find another job . no use being miserable . or tell her boss !
what ' s el ##s ?
ah , got ##cha . a few of my friends teach english to chinese students online and i think they have taken es ##l courses
that really sucks ! what do you have to do ?
i do too . i am so sorry you are going through this
wow . i had that dvd .
i know . i wonder if they still do that show
some dad ##s are cool like that . my mom is that way sometimes .
i just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
are you a bus ##drive ##r ?
ah , got ##cha . i hate it when things happen out of our control . hope you get it figured out
hi what you got going on ?
that is really sad . are you alright ?
i ' m sorry . will you be able to pass this semester /
i ' m sure it will happen .
i am sure you will do well !
i don ' t think you will need to worry then .
sorry to hear that . why did they not attend ?
hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon .
ha , hope you aren ' t too scarred about being all by yourself .
watching too many horror movies i bet . just put on some comedy special .
that ' s quite an accomplishment . you must have worked very hard .
that must have been a very hard time . your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope .
that ' s very good . it takes a disciplined person to save money
you true ##ly are determined to get that car , what brand is it ?
i hope you pass your exam . did you do good at your exam ?
good luck
really ? what happened ?
wow , cool ! did they let you in ? it ' s so cool you had that opportunity .
ic ##k . i ' ve never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that .
ah , i see . the classic photo trick . i understand why you would be upset about that . that ' s def ##ini ##tly why it ' s so important to go see before you buy
hi , tell me what ' s going on with you ?
oh , i ' m well thank you .
oh really ? any reason why ?
wow really ? that ' s pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing .
do tell
that ' s neat ! i ' ve only seen ducks and chickens . a deer did bounce over my car once , though
i guess it didn ' t turn out well ?
oh . sweet ! cong ##rat ##s ! what are you going to do with all that money ? ?
save it for spider - man that comes out next month ! i can ' t wait for that
and more to come hopefully ! don ' t forget to save for retirement and / or emergency fund : d
hello
am doing well thanks and you ?
hi
fine . but , i think you ' re suppose to do the prompt ##s , so hope it doesn ' t cause you a rejection .
what have your experiences been like ?
that ' s good to hear ! hope that it continues that way .
oh i hate that . is it a high interest rate ?
it ' s highway robbery . well i can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible .
you read
that ' s great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent : ) but you do have great friend that are depend ##able
oh my god , that must have been so em ##bar ##ras ##ing ! was there actually a fire ?
its okay , at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment .
oh no , i hate having connectivity problems ! are you having bad weather ?
oh , it has been raining here a lot too . i will keep my fingers crossed that your wi - fi keeps working !
yes , i am here
oh no , i bet that was stress ##ful . what did you do ?
i like my alone time too . what do you enjoy doing by yourself ?
oh that ' s is fun . it ' s a way to be alone with your thoughts , but still be around others . i love to watch people !
yes i can related to that feeling
well , a great morning leads to a great day
which movie did you watch ?
that is a very scary movie ! how are you coping ?
what was hurt ##ful may i ask ?
that sounds like very bad treatment , you should sue them
maybe you haven ' t done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorse ##ful about . do you think that ' s it ?
maybe . it ' s none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way , they could be experiencing depression .
i suppose it is .
you always have options !
sounds like someone who is actually not a friend . how long have you known her ?
i used to work with a girl like that . she always talked bad about me but was nice to my face .
i can ' t say that i really do . it ' s always a mystery in my mind .
i believe i see it more as that type . no one can truly know .
i know what you mean . wednesday ##s there ' s this market i like to go to , but lately it just has so much rotten food
totally . i still love to go have a look around
yes , it is partially true . what is the problem ?
i understand .
that is very true . did something bad happen to you ?
generally just try to ignore it as best as you can . i ' m good about just letting things roll off my back .
oh no ! those can be difficult to spot sometimes .
wow . that must have been stress ##ful . i have babies , too . did they understand ?
that is a relief . sounds like you made it just in time .
i get it . sometimes i feel stressed out for no real reason myself .
well sometimes companies make mistakes . i doubt it ' s anything you did .
i think it ' s very common that we take things for granted .
i think you can really think about all that you have , and show your thanks that you have these things .
what was de ##pressing ?
oh , that sounds like a bum ##mer . do you think it will change ?
what is the name of the show ?
no , i ever did .
why hasn ##t it already been returned ?
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner , i hear you can go to small claims and get 3 ##x the amount awarded to you
yeah r / legal ##ad ##vic ##e has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me , pretty neat to know that landlord ##s can ##t just sc ##am you
that ' s cool . i ' ve always been a mac kind of girl , but i would look into a surface is i was in the market for a new computer .
i get that . i got a bamboo tablet a few years ago , but i feel like working directly on the screen would be even better .
what was ?
oh that does sound nice
well in some ways solitude is nice .
true everything is nice in bits . too much of anything does get ti ##ring .
be responsible about what ?
i understand . i have to get work around my house done today too , before i can go out .
oh no , sorry to hear , hope you are ok .
i agree . hope the car will look good again .
sorry to hear that . did you try to talk to a friend ?
i understand
i agree , where did you find them ?
oh i see , ha ! i would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable !
was it an accident ?
oh ! thank good ness ! that was close
do you especially enjoy mac ##ada ##mia nuts or just eating ?
it must be difficult living with a nut all ##ergy . do you over ##ea ##t on mac ##ada ##mia nuts regularly ?
it ' s awful out there . it ' s been in the 100 ' s here in tx
that sucks ! i hate wasps and most other bugs , so i feel your annoyance .
what job did you apply to ?
somehow i suspect that they ##re not looking forward to having you though : p ( no offence ) i can ##t remember anyone that enjoyed high school lo ##l . its a good job though ! literally backbone of society
yeah that ' s always comforting . mom ' s are awesome
not really . we usually tend to think alike . why do you ask ?
cool . so you ' re the awesome mother here ?
i ' m sorry to hear that
: ( did you stay friends with him ?
did you get admission ?
that ' s great news , well done .
: )
me too , especially when it ' s still the middle of the day .
oh yes , you ' re right . i ' m in the same boat right now !
i think i am missing something , you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizza ##s ? ? ?
it ' s definitely some kind of anomaly .
what did you eat there ?
o ##oo ##oh onion soup sounds really good , onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish
i would have flipped and never talked to him again . i am so sorry my god what did you do ?
id ##k beat him up , lo ##l . throw a drink at him , the sky is the limit !
cool , how did it come by ?
if you put so much work into it , im sure they will
i am so sorry ! i would have a hard time for ##giving that betrayal of trust . how long have you been together ?
wow . i hope that you can work it out , but i would understand why you wouldn ' t want to .
really ? well , who doesn ##t !
i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas
wow , what was it ?
woo ##ho ##o ! you are one lucky child !
no way ! i just moved from ny to fl . you are going to love ny tho , its an awesome state . cong ##rat ##s on the job !
oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city . i was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like idaho where i lived in ny . : p
i would too why would she not tell you ! ? did ya ##ll break up ?
that sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved . : /
what incident was that ?
what happened then ?
i know what you mean , it sucks when those " dates " linger over us even if we try not to think about them . im so sorry to hear that !
its not time to get over it , you aren ##t doing any wrong its okay to " feel " things . i hope people around you give you a lot of love !
i understand what you are saying , pets are always close to our hearts
yeah , i have 2 german shepard ##s
is it a scary movie ?
no i never heard of it
ye ##a that ##s probably the best choice to make
i can understand that
yu ##ck , that is terrible . i would be grossed out too . what did you do ?
i ' m sure you did . guess he couldn ' t make it to the trash can .
oh that ##s really sweet !
oh no . . i hope you feel better
those are great aren '
sorry ( those are great aren ' t they ? ) i do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years . those memories are to be cher ##ished and repeated : )
wow that is a lot to take in . get a muzzle
i can understand that
do you think it was the right decision ?
that ' s great . maybe you will get a raise too
why is that
oh i can understand that
that must have been terrifying
i don ' t know what i would have done
awesome ! what kind of dog is lola ?
i don ' t think i would have been able to stop smiling either ! that is so awesome !
that ' s nice , is she technological ##ly sa ##v ##vy ?
well it ' s nice she ' s making the effort !
i do too . i have a box filled with them . how old is your oldest ?
wow !
that ' s good . now you don ' t have to worry about it .
wow , your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things !
what did you bet ?
that would be awesome ! did your cousin pay you ?
oh no , i am sorry to hear that . i hope she is okay .
i am so sorry . i hope she is able to get some relief and rest .
oh man ! that must have been great to hear ! what did he say ?
that ' s so funny ! that ' s one of those things you will definitely remember forever !
oh i can understand that ! i would also like to be outside ; it looks like such a beautiful day ! at least it is almost the weekend !
that ' s great ! are you going to join your friends at the park ?
you should have taken a flashlight just in case .
hey at least you got a nice workout in !
that is true . well i ' m glad you made it home safely . maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out .
i had ice cream too ! sorry you got sick
ha , at least it was good
that ##s always fun ! does your pup do well with other dogs ?
mine does the same thing . golden ##s are so adorable .
he is just a mix breed . we really don ' t even know .
lo ##l , it happens to us all
ha ##ha true
that sucks did you need to return something ?
that stuff is pretty expensive . maybe you can sell it on e ##bay or something .
oh wow ! i would have been so disgusted and outraged ! what did you do ?
that must have been a terrible experience . i ' m not sure that i would be able to wear that jacket again .
i hope you do really well
going to see some old friends this weekend
good job what did you work hard on ?
nice keep it up !
that is awesome ! what are you studying
was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it ?
well good luck ! i am sure you will do great !
i do like the rain though
i am sure you will have plans again
yeah , i am sure it will be fine
i would have been to . i always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that .
same here . i saw a ferrari at the supermarket the other day . i was jealous , and i also thought about how i would be worried something would happen to it ( if it were mine ) .
i take you don ' t have issued with you weight .
ok , then . if it was a 1 thing only , no problem .
is he acting creepy at all ?
have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is ?
that ' s good you have well - behaved dogs , did you train them ?
well it ' s good you ' re doing something right .
oh no ! what did you do to bring yourself down ? ( from the panic attack )
i ' m sorry . that sounds bad . flying always makes me nervous but i usually make it ok .
well we are friends aren ' t we ? i do appreciate you as one .
you wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend ? they will probably like you . tim likes some things you do .
oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don ' t think about it .
just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender .
nap ##time is a good thing though isn ##t it
well that is never good
that doesn ##t sound too fun
oh wow , the kid is a s ##ni ##tch
it happens , everyone does it
i am sure you will fix it

did you replace it ?
do you think he ' ll get angry ?
did you start walking faster ?
hopefully you made it out safely
that is good to hear . what happened that made you think so ?
oh ok . that sounds like they really get along well . it is nice to have good neighbors .
oh no ! was he ok ? i hope it was nothing serious !
that ' s good to know ! you all have a lot to be thankful for !
i would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward .
i hope it wasn ' t too much money just in case .
what you you have planned ?
really ? ? it sounds like there was something going on .
oh that ' s never a good situation . it happens to the best of us though . i need to clean my fridge
i ' m sure they were thinking waste not , want not . ha ##ha
oh yeah ? find anything interesting ?
ah , nothing quite like that feeling . i remember when i was on the school newspaper . good times .

oh no , that sucks . would you have wanted to go though ?
well , that ' s not cool .
does he do that stuff often ?
oh ? what kind of project ?
oh that ' s nice of them !
that ' s good , do you get paid over time ?
i think if you keep it up you ' ll get the recognition you want soon .
was everything okay ? what were they doing ?
true , you never know these days .
is your phone water ##proof ?
you are so lucky ! my phone would have been done . . .
that ' s great ! are you seeing results ?
i bought a spin bike but i haven ' t used it yet
maybe they were left for you .
he can ' t save them out in the open . what kind were they ?
did he get it back ? i hate it when that happens . . .
you are a true friend indeed . i bet he is very app ##re ##cia ##tive !
did he eventually find one ?
that is making progress .
congratulations ! what do you plan on doing ?
that is a great goal to set for yourself .
i am sorry to hear that . i hope the results will be good .
it is good new .

i am sorry you are feeling like this . maybe you should reach out to someone
i am sorry that you are going through this
oh wow , now that ' s funny ! i ' ve only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small , but i loved it !
oh wow ! i ' d love to go on a much larger coaster than the one i road . but it might be scar ##ier than i imagine .
how old is he ?
they are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress .
oh no ! well hopefully she wasn ' t too upset , then you ' ll know how her character is : )
oh no ! well , honestly if she can ' t deal with one mistake , then it ' s no good any ##how . but maybe it was something else . sometimes people just don ' t click .
i feel you ! i don ' t like to perform in front of people either . did you decline ?
oh you can be as bad as you want there , it just matters if you ' re having fun : )
wow , i bet it was a long day of moving , but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you , congratulations ! ! ! !
i used to move furniture for my old job , so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting , its so exciting to finally have your own place
i hope you do ! what is the test on ?
oh man . that was a difficult subject for me after physics . are you a science major ?
i understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesn ' t fit with your old friends .
you can make new friends . its just part of the human experience . everything is temporary
oh no . i am so sorry to hear that !
dogs are with us for such a short amount of time . kinda wish they lived as long as us .
friends can be so awesome !

oh dear lord . . was he sick or something ?

sorry to hear that my friend . why did you move ?
i see . . don ##t worry , you will own your new city soon enough
i am sorry to hear that , why did you move there ?
i am sorry to hear that , why did you move there ?
did you end up buying anything ?
well is it close to where you live ? that would be cool to go back often
that is a good tactic actually , it boost ##s your confidence
very true . we should believe in ourselves for others to do that
oh my god , sorry to hear that my friend . . were you guys close ?
how sad . . find peace knowing that she is in heaven now
what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
when i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one
that sounds tough . how do you think you did ?
me , too - - i ' m so ##rr ##ry you had to go through that . at least it ' s over now , right ?
maybe they know a friend who knows a friend .
yep , that ' s the way of the world , especially with universities to .
a duplicate ? like a fake ?
that sucks . i ' d be very upset . you have to be careful who you order from online . some times if the price is too goo ##t to be true its a fake product .
oh no that is so frustrating ! what did you do ?
ah yes , a glass of wine might help to make that feel better . still , what a pain . lou ##sy end to a lou ##sy day .
i would be so lost without my phone , but i could make it through an evening . the house keys though !
was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account ?
so , it was your partner who used you card
oh no ! was anyone hurt ?
that ' s pretty scary . did the boar survive the ordeal ?
are you willing to go on another safari ?
i ' m not surprised .
that ' s very intense . i am sorry you had to experience that .
that ' s good . time heal ##s all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain .
you are telling me you are a ho ##ard ##er ?
everyone is nos ##tal ##gic one way or another . you are fine
oh my goodness ! that ##s terrible . did anyone see ? my face would be bright red .
i ' m sure this will be one of those times where you cr ##inge when you think back on it ! i ' m sure you made those guy ' s days though
that ' s crazy ! i ' m glad there was nothing there .
some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment .
that ' s great . i bet it was wonderful experience .
that ' s cool . taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal .
i am sorry to hear that . did you get hurt .
do you have full cover ?
where did this happen ? ! were there any other people with you ?
did it happen while you were in the store ? i hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing .
oh that is pretty cool . what did you think ?
yeah , we were bliss ##fully unaware of the real world in those days . it must have been nice to re ##mini ##sc ##e .
that has got to feel good ! you must feel very happy and relaxed !
cher ##ish this time you have , because you never know when it could change !
what restaurant is it for ?
sounds good . i love mom n pop restaurants . so much better than big popular restaurants .
that sounds really interesting . were there any good matches ?
well at least you are putting yourself out there . a lot of people give up on finding love .
oh no , i hate ca ##vi ##ties . are you brushing your teeth everyday ?
dan ##g , that sucks . i hope you can find a solution for that
wow , you must be proud ! he might cure cancer next !
genius ##es don ' t do chores my friend .
i ' m so sorry to hear about your mom . it ' s good that you ' re at peace with it , though .
but a part of her is still here in you .
they left you all alone ? i bet you feel lonely . . .
i know that feeling . i like to keep the tv on to drown out the silence
whoever ate it all is evil ! ! !
i know right . i would be so furious !
i would do it ! try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds .
yeah , something should be done about it !
i ' ve done that before when i was just annoyed with them . don ' t feel bad !
who cares ! i always like to think of satisfying myself first before others !
oh no ! that ' s a smell ##y situation to be in . what did you end up doing to fix it ?
what a pain ! i bet that cost a fortune . did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up ?
that must have been a great reunion ! who was happier , him or you ?
he was lucky to have you waiting there for him !
u ##gh , i hate when unexpected expenses arise .
well , that was nice of them . i hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back .
wow , great for her ! i am confused as to how you ended up gaining though !
well , keep at it and you will get where you want to be . it really just comes down to how many cal ##ories you take in vs . how many cal ##ories you burn per day .
please tell me you won a lot of money .
lo ##l that ' s how i would of reacted too . one hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff .
oh no ! that ' s in ##fur ##iating . did the stain come out ?
hopefully they remember
did you brush it right out ?
maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings ?
you could go to the party . and then learn how to swim !
ye ##a , and you can bring some water toys to play with !
awesome ! i bet you felt proud at what you accomplished . did you have this goal in mind for a while ?
how much total weight did you lose , and how long did it take ?
that ##s awesome . i wish i could go . where are you going ?
cruises are awesome . you get to eat as much food as you want . you ' ll probably put on like 10 pounds
aw ##w man , i hope you brought your rain ##coat .
that ' s good , you don ' t want to get soaked and catch a cold .
that ' s amazing . you must have been so surprised and happy !
did you get a video of it ?
gee , he must have been really hungry ! that ' s a lot of eggs !
wow . . that ' s unbelievable . i wonder how his cho ##les ##terol is .
oh dan ##g , that really sucks . i can ' t believe ts ##a would go that far , it must ' ve been super embarrassing .
dude , you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it .
oh yeah , what was it called ? i really love roller coaster ##s !
i saw that one on tv . it looks absolutely nuts . i hope to visit cedar point one day !
oh , i hope you get some good news . i am sure it would help you getting aid for college .
all you can do is be patient and see what happens . i am sure everything will work out for you .
that ' s awesome . i hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee . are you excited to be there ?
well i am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day . enjoy the after party !
wow , that sounds fun . what type of artwork did you see ?
gee , she must have her hands full ! i hope she does well as an artist !
did you feel very em ##as ##cula ##ted by this ?
yeah , i can see that viewpoint as well . she may end up carrying you to bed next time !
i ' m glad he returned home safe and sound . did he have fun on the camping trip ?
my mom was the same way . it ' s all part of being a parent . i hope to have kids soon too and i worry about stuff concerning them myself !
oh wow , i bet the emotions of that came back to you .
yes , those memories are what make life so special .
so , not a surprise , but still nice to get ?
that ' s sweet .
wow , that ##s very ad ##mir ##able of you . people who abuse animals are the worst kind of people .
i have 2 dogs myself and i could never imagine hurting them . i can ' t believe there are people out there who think that that is ok . its sick .
yeah those were the days . when we had no worries in the world .
that sounds really cool . i always wanted a tree ##house but never had a good tree for it .
oh yeah , why is that ?
i would have them towed !
oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them ?
or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out .
that ' s awesome . which disney park did you go to ?
o ##oh i live pretty close to it . you have a great husband to give you that treat !
that ' s good that you found happiness . that ' s what were all in the pursuit of right ?
you are blessed . make sure to spread the positive energy .
that ' s great that you can trust her . how old ?
that ' s great . be thankful , some people aren ' t so lucky .
what did you almost buy ?
it ' s hard to find good quality at wal ##mart
i would try target . good quality stuff there .
try goo ##gling it , and read thru the reviews
finding a buyer can be tough . you have a good agent ?
does it have a good location ? you know the only rule of real estate , right ? location , location , location .
sounds good . definitely should target a family buyer then
you got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well ?
that ##s never good when you have a bad manager . what made them so bad ?
know it all ##s are the worst . hopefully you are in a better spot now , with a manager who cares .
oh no ! what ' s wrong with your dad ?
aw , i ' m so sorry to hear that . it ' s not easy to watch our parents age .
we can surely hope !
that must have made you feel terrible . were you able to find the dog ?
i sincerely hope you can find him ! but i bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn ' t do it on purpose .
doesn ' t he understand that people have to go to work in the morning ?
you might have to file a noise complaint with the police .
what is causing you to question whether it ' s the right thing for you or not ?
yeah , i ' ve done that as well . it can definitely be a hard job , considering dealing with the public , hours during holiday seasons , etc . . but sometimes if the pay is good , it can out ##weig ##h some of the negative ##s .
lo ##l that remind me of a movie i saw with robert den ##iro , that ##s abs ##ol ##ut ##ly bi ##zza ##re by the way but cool at the same time
wow , i would love to have a cat like yours
aw ##w that ##s too bad that no one else could go . what concert was it ?
ha ##ha that must have been a crazy concert !
sometimes that depends on the industry . if she works in ones that have high turnover it ' s not a big of a deal as , say , an administrative job
well , i ' m not entirely sure about the banking side but i wonder what she ' s looking for . perhaps a small vs big bank culture
o ##oo i love doing that , but not so much the up ##hea ##val in the midst of it . what room are you going to be working on ?
still , a new color can definitely bright ##en up a space and make it feel all new !
that ' s awesome ! i wish i could wake up that way every morning . did something specific make you feel that way ?
ha ! ! well i ' ve woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - i guess it can go the other way too !
i ' ve done that before . . . i enjoyed it too ! i love looking back at old pictures and stuff
some of it but my grandma did save a lot . i plan on doing that with my kids
i love cheese too ! what kind of cheese was it ?
go ##uda is great ! do you like pro ##sc ##iu ##tto too ?
aw ##w poor baby , hopefully she ##s doing fine now .
that ' s great to hear . you have one tough cat .
ha , i used to do that too . but i was almost always disappointed by the toy once i actually got it .
true ! mcdonald ' s was my first job when i was 14 and i remember being stoke ##d i could now collect all the toys even if i didn ' t play with them !
did they tell you when you may hear back from them ?
i pray they get in touch with you soon and that ' s is an affirmative on the job ! i know how nerve - wr ##ack ##ing waiting can be though - i hope you get it !
ar ##gh ##hh ##hh ##hh ##hh ! i soo ##oo feel for you and have been there . have y ' all had the chance to talk about it ? ( or do you even want to ? )
i hear you . maybe humor might help ? like " okay , so * this * is awkward . . . . can we talk about that email ? " heart ##felt apologies go a long way , and even if she doesn ' t respond - - you ' ll feel better for trying .
are you sure they didn ##t bring the wrong bill ?
i would have complained .
oh ##h , i feel sorry for you
oh ##h , that ' s bad . you can always sky ##pe your family !
yes , i feel you . cleaning sucks , but after all that hard work , the results are amazing !
me too ! you seem just like me !
that sounds very exciting ! what kind of planning did you put into such an achievement ?
that ' s so cool ! i wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness , joy and fun times !
are there any other family members out there that could help her ?
wow , i hope that she was able to work things out . not the best way to start living somewhere far from home , but i ' m sure she figured something out .
that ' s great ! i am happy for you !
yeah , and they are paying you good enough . you are a luck ##iest person !
i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule
same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will
i am so sorry to hear that . i have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past , so i can understand what you ' re going through . i ' m sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family .
aw ##w that ' s great ! what breed ?
oh no ! that sounds so scary . was everything ok ?
good i ' m glad to hear that . that ' s a long time . hospitals scare me , i can ' t imagine being there for that long
i ' m so sorry to hear that ! hopefully he or she wasn ' t in too much pain at the end .
oh my go ##sh that ' s horrible . i hope they caught the person who hit her !
oh man , that ' s gross ! at least it was vomit and not something else .
how many cats do have ?
aw , i am so sorry . how long did you have your dog for ?
they say dogs are mans best friend .
what kind of dog was he ?
nice , i have an australian shepherd . he follows me around everywhere .
oh no . that ' s terrible . i lost my dad five years ago , i know how terrible that feels .
neither did we . he seemed so healthy , and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn ' t even talk . i miss him every day ,
surprise gifts are always fun .
that sounds like a well deserved plan .
oh man , i can relate , that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
life is full of experiences like that , they seem scary from the outside , but once you relax you get swept away
that sounds pre ##tt ##ty bad !
i cannot imagine if something like that happens to me . i would be trying very hard to find it .
sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help . i will try that !
i agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think .
the frustration they go through well at least we don ' t have to take the kids or parents home .
what store were you at ?
could you get a rain check ? that is a bum ##mer ?
aw man , i ' m sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do to make you feel better ?
ice cream cake is my favorite ! i ' m glad you ' re feeling better ha ##ha . you have a really nice co - worker .
that ' s really awesome ! she sounds like a great person to work with .
oh , i know how that goes . my husband loves sweets , but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it it will get eaten right then . getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them . lo ##l
that ' s probably what i would do also . it won ' t kill him to wait another day .
oh i hate when that happens . we go to self check ##out to avoid things like slow lines .
hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don ' t hold the line up in the future .
oh man , that must have hurt . did she know you had feelings for her ?
sounds like your friend broke bro code , that was kind of sc ##um ##my .
wow ! what a nice friend . i wish my friends did that
that ' s great . it ' s nice to have people so close to you . it really helps in bad times
that must of been a proud moment for you as a father . she ' s all grown up and out in the real world now
that ' s awesome , she ' ll have a great time and learn a lot i ' m sure !
wow ! what are you gonna do with the winning ##s ?
bills do take up a lot , don ' t they .
oh my go ##sh ! that ##s funny . was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted ?
how did you discover exactly what it was ?
roller coaster ##s are scary for me . how was it for you ?
i ' m the same way ha ##ha . but how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time ? !
i am so sorry to hear that . i ' m sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys .
you went through a lot of losses .
that sounds painful , i hope you were okay after your fall .
yeah i bet that was really embarrassing , but i ' m glad you ' re okay .
oh boy ! that ' s always a nail bite ##r waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know . did you get it ? ! !
amazing ! cong ##rat ##ulation ! prayer is always a good thing to do ! that is so incredible . are you enjoying the job ?
i remember those times . did you get what you wanted ?
the super nintendo is a classic . what is your favorite game ?
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! i would feel the same way but you just have to think . . . who cares what others think ! if they can ' t have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them . did you get hurt ?
i bet they didn ' t . i like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations . so glad you ' re alright ! hope you own a helmet !
how ' d the hurricane go ?
thank goodness . hurricanes are no joke .
was he okay ?
well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it . i would be afraid just because he is afraid .
maybe so . it ' s good he has a good home now .
i bet he is . don ' t worry
that is a great idea
saving money is important
that ' s amazing ! you must be so proud .
she ' s also a hard worker .
that was very sweet they don ' t have to actually do that .
good to know there is still kind people in the world .
that ' s awesome ! who were they from ?
that was really sweet of him , maybe he just wanted you to know you ' re loved .
you can never be too prepared ! i am sure you have got everything .
that was very smart thinking on your part . have fun on your trip !
we all do things we regret when drinking
that ##s usually how it goes
you definitely took a leap of faith there . how ' d it go ?
ha ##ha ##ha i definitely admire your courage to have done that .
i wish you luck
i am sure you will meet them
that ' s disappointing . what happened ? did he just not do anything ?
i would have been disappointed , too .
oh no that is a total bum ##mer . it ' s especially common in the summer months .
oh right , i spent some time in florida when i was younger and i remember it being so unpredictable . just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lo ##l .
cool . was it interesting ?
good for her ! mom ##s get a lot done lo ##l
are you happy or sad ?
i bet . i she moving school or a job ?
oh cool that ' s great ! what were you doing that they recognised ?
awesome . what is your job ?
wow was it a sc ##am or was it leg ##it ?
that is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for ?
oh no , what happened ?
oh no ! but that happens ( it has happened to me several times ) . at least you had the great workout !
that ' s great . are you excited ?
is it your dream job ? then you should really be happy .
was it real ?
that ' s awesome . what are you going to buy ?
australia . i hope to go there some day
i bet , i will get there one day
i ' ve done the same thing before . i ' m sure you weren ' t a bother
yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
that has happen ##d to me too .
you can always sell them if you buy discs . can ##t do anything with a download though
we live and we learn lo ##l
i used to love that band
i have not either
probably at 4 or 5 ! lo ##l
no idea ! i haven ' t had cable in so long ! i would hate that and they always over charge ! don ' t they have a rule that there ##s no service fee if they are late ?
was it real because i get those every day lo ##l
i could do so much with $ 120 . im jealous lo ##l
oh no ! what happened ?
ah , crisis ave ##rted ! that could have been a lot worse
was it good ? i hate when your favorite place di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s .
that ' s great . sundays are supposed to be bree ##zy
hm , that sounds interesting . i ' m not really familiar with this kind of situation , since i ' ve never had to rent a car . what exactly happened , or what did that mean ?
oh , so it was no big deal ? at least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it . no harm , no foul .
i bet that was a nice feeling
that sounds perfect
the dentist makes me a bit nervous
well at least think about the fact that it ' s a good thing to go to the dentist !
that is awful , did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number ?
you should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot , maybe they can track down the car .
what kind of food was there ?
it is nice that you enjoyed it .
oh man . that would of startled me too . what did you do after ?
well i can understand your nervous ##ness . i probably would be on guard as well
oh that is tough . it is hard when our pets pass away .
it is like losing a family member isn ' t it . well , just think of all the good times and be thankful .
that ' s great ! i never really studied much so i could have done better on my tests
oh yes . but , i found that getting involved in clubs along with a major i liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun . it ' s a subtle , but important di ##ffe ##ence
judging by the : ( , i ' m assuming you didn ' t get to join them ?
i would be en ##vious too . perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling : d
i hope where ever you go , you visit someplace amazing !
that is nice . do you like a lot pizza ?
you are lucky .
were you worried about something ? what was keeping you up ?
hopefully you had a lock on them , you can never be too safe .
dan ##g really ! sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents .
that means that he is always listening and paying attention to you !
i have never tried a cold shower ? what is it like ?
i bet it does wake you up right away . i guess i should try that sometime if i overs ##lee ##p . lo ##l !
wow that is very rude of her
no i have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
i totally agree . that actually sounds really good ri ##hg ##t now .
sounds fun . ill be ready . hope were going to the beach that ##s closest to us !
i will be expecting to see you there .
having positive attitude always succeed . keep it up .
interesting . what was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this ?
is that a reference to the color of the hair , the shape or something else ?
how did it go ? that ' s an anxiety - inducing but hopeful situation !
congratulations ! enjoy the new gig ! good things happen to good people .
being defeat ##ist is never a good move . honestly , once you ' ve got your foot in the door i think it ' s all about personality .
i would argue most good employers can dia ##gno ##se inc ##omp ##ete ##nce from the first or second conversation . if they can ' t , maybe they aren ' t good employers .
time does fly really fast . i just turned 30 and it feels like i was just a teenager yesterday !
i ' m sure it will . at least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment .
yeah , it ' s like a small world .
i think it is merely a coincidence .
indeed they can . is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about ?
oh , i see . i thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
i completely agree . we must have positive thoughts at all times .
our thoughts are were everything starts . minds ##et is so important .
that ' s awesome ! what do they do ?
that would be nice , but it ' s never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future .
that sucks . how fast were you driving ?
i hate getting pulled over too . es ##pe ##ca ##illy for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
oh man , i ' m so sorry to hear that . you ' re not a loser though ! just take one day at a time . if you re ##la ##pse ##d yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow
don ' t be so hard on yourself . we are all humans , we make mistakes .
that is probably so annoying
that really sucks . how long will it be going on ?
wow . that ' s either really lucky or un ##lu ##cky , depending on what you want . are you wanting kids ?
well , then congratulations ! i wish you the best of luck , and enjoy this time ! : )
why not ?
oh man ! that is why i watch movies at home . it ' s just more comfortable .
i have considered it myself but feel the same as you . will you go back again ?
right , i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out ! !
is she doing okay now ?
great , i am very glad to hear she is getting better !
what is the job ?
well cong ##rat ##s then , i am sure that is not easy
what caused that to happen ?
oh go ##sh , hopefully it doesn ##t happen next time
what were the photos of ?
it is good to have those and look at once in awhile
i am sorry to hear that , what happened ?
did you try therapy at all or counseling ?
why is that ?
i am sorry to hear that , i hope things improve for you a ton !
sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us . . . they are many
i interpret the difficulties
the lack of humor
ok
oh goodness , i am so sorry to hear that . was it sudden ?
that is awful and very sorry you had to go through that . i work at a cancer hospital so i can ' t imagine going through that with a loved one .
what kind of stuff is in there ?
oh okay , i love going through my old stuff too , it is really fun
that sounds so fun !
i hope you both have tons of fun !
that ' s great ! i ' m glad to hear that . we often take our health for granted .
i ' m one of those people . eat junk food even though i know it ' s not good for me
uh oh what happened
oh no , well mistakes do happen , it will be behind you in a few days
exactly good luck
oh yeah ? what kind of old stuff ?
i always liked those old lunch boxes myself . do you have a favorite ?
nice ! i loved that show when i was a kid . i never had the lunch box though .
oh , ok ! where are you moving to ?
that ' s good ! that will make your life much easier ! congratulations !
that ' s exciting . do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes ?
what all is on the agenda for the date ?
great . are you going to get it published ?
what is the book about ?
boo . what genre ?
oh no that is the worst ! did you clean it up ?
you sho ##ud ##l write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
oh no ! what happened ?
ou ##ch . i hope she ' s okay .
that ##s good , its always a good feeling after
that ##s the way to do it
did his team win ?
that ' s great news ! i bet you ' re so proud .
oh no ! why are they driving you crazy ?
that is no good ! i guess it is time for you to go shopping !
storms are the worst and destroy so much .
my family went through a big storm a few years ago .
what happened on the phone call ?
i am so sorry about that .
has it made any scratch marks ?
have you tried disc ##ip ##lining him in anyway
sounds like it ' s time for a crate .
ye ##a , i hate calling at ##t or ve ##riz ##on they take forever to get on the phone .
i think as we get smarter , it will get better .
wow ! sounds like a keeper right there ! that must have been a nice surprise for you !
it is always nice when someone gets their priorities right !
oh no ! that is horrible ! is he ok ?
that is really sad ! i hope it was quick and pain ##less . i hate seeing anything suffer !
did you let him borrow it ?
that ' s good to hear . i assume everything went ok ?
awesome . all ##s well that ends well .
did you say yes ?
where does she plan to go ?
money problems are never fun . trust me , i know .
yeah , definitely . have you tried asking for a raise ?
oh no , i ' m so so sorry . i ' ve always had at least one pet throughout my life , and they ' re truly part of the family .
yes , they ' re honestly more dear to me than my friends . i hope you ' re doing okay - i ' m sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life , so try to take comfort in that .
that is great ! doing what ?
i bet that is nice and probably has good benefits !
i can never go on long trips .
i can no longer afford them , long trips cost the most .
oh no ! . are you ok ? must not have been a bad one if you were laughing ?
how ironic . i kind of wish i were there to see it .
i am bad at every game .
i still could not do that , i am very weak human person .
do what i did , quit the job and live at home with mom .
i still thing living with a relative is the cheap ##est way to go .
that ' s awful ! luckily i paid all mine off , but i know many people still struggle with it
ye ##a . . . the education costs are at ##ro ##cious and , honestly , not even worth it on my opinion . it ' s just the piece of paper . the material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so
typical of most companies . ask employees to do more and pay less .
what kind of job do you have ?
i ' m sorry , did anyone see ?
i hope you would wear a belt next time .
that sounds like a blast . compared to my job lo ##l .
i ' m sorry . i like my job but its certainly not like hers !
lo ##l . be careful . . that ##s a ton of car ##bs .
e ##w ##w lo ##l
happy birthday !
what all did they do for you ?
how long did it take for you to teach you dog that ?
i thought i would take longer , like months !
oh no . maybe you can get some things done around the house .
lo ##l , that sounds like a plan . working two jobs is hard .
yu ##mmy . . . what did you eat ? i am hungry .
that sounds so good . like i love that stuff .
i am glad no one in your family is sick .
thank goodness my family is healthy too .
but do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits . it may be worth it still ,
benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
is there a special reason ?
going anywhere good ?
that sounds fun
that is great . how have you done it ?
that is a lot of walking . i can hardly walk 1 mile .
i have never been on a trip before .
i have long weeks every single day .
i would just quit and live off the government .
everyone can ! just gotta try .
how sweet and thoughtful of you
you seem to be a very compassionate person , very kind ##hearted .
oh ##h , i so sorry .
hope you are doing better . i ' ll pray for you .
good for you ! stay healthy
forget that ! eat pizza and enjoy life .
i agree , i eat what i want when i want all the time .
you have to have fun !
get drunk and go out !
i never go to the store anymore , i wish i did .
not for me , i shop online mostly these days .
just go for it ! never look back !
best of luck my friend , you can do anything .
i own an animal shelter here in my home town .
i try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs .
that ' s great ! i hope she goes to a good graduate school .
i am very happy for you !
i am so sorry to hear that she has passed . how long has she been gone ?
i know how you feel .
is your friend ok ? what kind of car was it ?
that is horrible news , i am so sorry for your loss .
is that good or bad ? sometimes extra work can be a blessing , unless you are sal ##ari ##ed , then it ' s just more work .
i hope so too . what kind of work is it ?
oh , i am sorry for your loss
don ' t feel bad now . what ' s done is done
i can understand . i am really sorry
oh no ! was anyone hurt ?
that is so sad . i hope they recover okay . hopefully you weren ' t in trouble for being late either .
that is awesome , are they coming to visit you ?
awesome ! i ' m not a father yet , but i can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives .
aw , i ' m sorry , did you just forget or you were thinking about other things ?
yeah , had a similar sc ##uf ##fle with my wife , but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget .
i have never liked spiders .
you should always have bug spray on you at all times .
that is really scary . are you home alone ?
i ' m sure you are fine . i bet it is just a tree branch or something like that . maybe a neighbor could go look for you .
ya ##y , a promotion is always amazing . when do you start ?
that ##s amazing , financial stability can be a life change ##r .
maybe they ' re very eager to go a certain item .
true , because regret ##fully i act that way sometimes too .
yeah i hear you ! do you like to read or watch tv ?
i like to do both as well . tv if i ' m feeling lazy , reading if i feel more ambitious .
oh no ! ! how did you dry them ?
oh that sounds awful ! but at least no one stole anything from your car .
did you take it back that is so disgusting .
i wouldn ' t want another either it takes one time for me to find hair , bug etc and i am done with the restaurant .
best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself .
that sounds great ! i really pays off to be prepared .
that sounds like some efficient planning ! i hope you enjoy your trip !
i can understand you . but this is the cycle of life , right ? kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world
good for you . you can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones
oh no , i ' m sorry . did you stay long ?
maybe she was around , but it wasn ' t time for the ball yet .
that ' s wonderful . he ' ll be so excited when he finds out !
i hope you guys have a great time . just the two of you .
concerts can be a lot of fun ! will you be going to another one ?
i ' ve never been to a beyonce concert . always sold out ! i ' m glad you got to see her .
congratulations ! good to hear your hard work is paying off .
you should definitely be proud of yourself . pat yourself on the back .
yeah i hope you get it ! i ' m sure they will recognize the extra time you ' ve been doing .
wow , i hope you ' re getting paid for all that extra time !
sorry to hear that my friend . . was she facing an emergency ?
i know it sucks , but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this
that is a tragedy ! where do you think you left it ? did you check your pockets ?
interesting . i hope you do find it . i don ' t know how you brush your hair .
how does that make you feel ?
i am so sorry to hear you ' re going through this . hopefully , it ' s nothing .
oh , so you always prepare well huh ?
i always wanted that level of discipline . good for you : )
congratulations ! boy or girl
well , as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine
yep . happy and healthy is a blessing
what ' s the band ?
wow . that must suck . do you like the band inc ##ub ##us ? i missed them a couple of times but i saw them this year
yes . i wish i could send you a clip of it from the concert . it was awesome . maybe you could catch def le ##ppa ##rd next time .
that sounds really cool .
oh , such great nostalgia .
o ##of that sucks .
ye ##a you shouldn ##t be
well hopefully you find a better path in life
oh wow , i did not even know about the transfer . i bet lake ##r fans are delighted
so true . i might become a lakers fan myself at this point
that really sucks . have you tried taking some mel ##aton ##in ?
yeah , it works wonders for me when i can ' t sleep .
oh god . . so sorry to hear that . . may i ask how did tom pass ?
i can feel your emotions . find peace in knowing that tom is at a better place now
why are you so thankful ? is it thanksgiving ?
that ' s great to hear . it ' s always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard .
oh no , that is a terrible thing to do .
i app ##lau ##d your response .
oh no ! ! ! did it smell bad ?
e ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ! hope the cat is okay !
sounds exciting . i wish you the best of luck !
don ' t worry everyone is nervous on the first day .
that ##s an awful thing to do ! what did you do ?
i am so glad that you did
oh no . . what happened ? did you face a financial loss ?
so sorry to hear that . . hopefully things work out for you real soon
great ! don ' t be nervous , be confident . works like a charm .
don ' t be . just visual ##ize yourself already having the job .
cong ##rat ##s
was it fun ?
that is no good dude
you should . and get new friend
you did ! that ' s so cool !
any free money is great .
oh that sounds exciting ! when do you go ?
a new start and a new life , that is exciting ! i hope you love it .
mine too . . the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall
i have been there , it is so lovely . you are going to love it
e ##w ##w ##w . i would have been too
did anyone video it ?
aw that ' s awful , how old was it ?
i hope you ' re holding up then , i would be devastated if my pet died .
ye ##a thank god he didn ##t go to the gs ##w
ye ##a i bet they are
you have eyes too
have eyes for someone else
oh ye ##a i know how that feels
it really does suck
that movie scared me to death , and i usually don ##t scare very easy .
oh my lord ! ! ! how did you sleep that night ?
oh no ! what happened /
okay good . i think everything is going to be okay ! keep your head up , friend !
im sorry to hear that
was she really sick ?
egg ##pl ##ant is gross but hey now you know ! lo ##l
i can ' t either ! i tried it once and i ' m like you . . . . . . no more !
that ' s so messed up ! why was he doing that ?
good to hear , how old was he ?
me too . marvel movies are the best . im late i just saw wonder ##woman
oh my word . i feel like i should watch them all over
is he sick ?
does he has any record with heart problems ?
oh wow that really sucks
dan ##g that is rough
that ' s so sad ! did he at least die of old age ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that , may he rest in peace .
is that because you just like being organized ?
that is really a good way to be . i need to practice this more , myself !
bed is always a source of comfort for me . especially , after work when i feel so drained and stressed out
indeed . particularly , when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite tv shows on youtube
aw i ' m sorry to hear . did you conquer your loneliness ?
i ' m glad you were able to adjust . it can be lonely without family around .
oh no . . why are you feeling that way ?
that sucks . . are you having trouble falling asleep ?
how did that go exactly ?
she is the most beautiful girl i have ever seen .
i don ##t blame you ! i would have also !
nasty ! did you tell him anything ?
oh wow ! i am so sorry that happened to you .
i would have called the cops on her !
what type of car was it ?
that must have been a very big man .
that ##s so nice , love when that happens
that nice , good for you
oh ye ##a why ##s that ?
oh that makes a lot of sense
what do you plan on doing today ?
i want some of whatever you had for breakfast . you seem very happy .
sorry to hear that ! why do you think that might happen ?
hopefully that doesn ' t happen , and you have job security .
that ' s pretty embarrassing ha ##ha . ever find out what it was ?
that would make sense , though you could probably have sm ##elt it if it was coffee .
oh damn that ' s so sad . was it salvage ##able ?
it definitely sounds that way , gonna upgrade it ?
oh ye ##a i had those out 2 years ago it sucks
ye ##a it can be sore and you can ##t eat anything
im glad i still have mine around .
exactly what i do . we were never close grow ##ig up . we are now .
wow , what is chill ##er theatre ? i ' m intrigued .
must be fun but un ##ner ##ving as well . what ##s your favourite horror movie ?
what happened to you ?
your best friends ?
really what kind of sweets did you eat ?
i love cookies especially ore ##o ' s they are my favorite
that is nice to have good memories .
did you go with your cousins ?
why is that
i was too
no , i don ' t get any golden opportunity . did you ?
don ' t worry . earn for it and go ! !
oh no . flood ##water ##s can be devastating . was there a lot of damage ?
good thing you were prepared .
did ya ##ll make up
that is not good
will you get to make it up ?
i am sure you will find time
oh wow , how did he do
that is so cool
that sounds like something that could really show off your talents .
that ' s great ! hope your hard work pays off .
how expensive is that to go to ?
that is not too bad if you had a good time though
the loss of a pet is heartbreak ##ing . i know how you feel . how old was trevor .
life is hard . but remember he didn ' t die he went to his forever home .
sorry to hear that . have you since been able to overcome your loneliness ?
i understand feeling like a duck out of the pond . glad to hear you ' ve made progress .
don ' t feel nervous , you need to be confident !
it ' s hard to push that feeling away sometimes , i know .
that ' s exciting ! i ' m guessing you ' re a lakers fan ?
what team was he on before ?
i understand that , i will pray for you
that makes sense , i wish you both the best of luck and health !
how old is he ?
wow , great job so far , ke ##p up the great parenting !
wasn ' t that out a long time ago ? it must ' ve been super scary if you still remember it .
wow , i wouldn ' t have been brave enough to do that !
yes , it is hard to see people with things you can ' t afford to buy for yourself .
yes , i like the color red as well . i have actually own a couple red sports cars .
it is great to be thorough and prepared . are you expecting to perform well ?
that ##s nice , i wish you the very best for your results !
i can see why ! that ' s highly inappropriate .
you should . he is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst hara ##ssing you
oh wow , that is going to be such a sweet experience !
that is very true . i sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time !
i ' m so sorry to hear that . do you have things of hers that remind you of her often ?
that is beautiful that you have those things of hers . mothers are very special people .
i have been to that , it is such a wonderful experience . you are going to love it !
you seem to have a great taste in spending your free time . i wish you get to have a splendid time in there !
i ' m sorry to hear about that . how did he die ?
yeah i bet . im sorry for your loss
how did you hurt your back ?
oh ##h wow ! i hope it gets better for you
did you ask him to replace it ?
i agree with you there , i would ask him to pay honestly
that ' s nice . how do you like the dog ?
that is so sweet . my apartments don ' t allow pets
that is for sure , especially a smell that just throws you back
exactly , sometimes i just smell a good bar ##be ##que and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid , life is great sometimes
that stink ##s . im sorry to hear that
i bet ! it seems like fun
congratulations . fun plans ?
aw ##w ##w . i ' m jealous lo ##l
aw ##w ##w . did you keep it ?
that ##s great . i know he appreciate ##s it
that ' s great . i hope you do well !
good luck !
how old was it
they live that long ? interesting
how ' d that go ?
well congratulations ! that must have been nerve - wr ##ack ##ing .
that stink ##s . maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
do it ! i bet you deserve it
did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car ?
well i am glad it worked out
what did you find ? !
oh no , are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs ?
remind me , which show was that ?
that ' s so cool ! i ' m gonna have to check it out
that ' s nice . are you going to hang it up ?
great , you ' ve found an old treasure .
i ' m sorry . how long had you been together ?
just try and get through each day , one at a time . don ' t think too far ahead .
that sounds scary . are you going to investigate ?
if this were a movie , i ' d be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there .
i am so sorry to hear that . is he planning to re ##take the test ?
what test ?
that ' s great . is that your only son ?
i ' m sure the memories will be great
oh wow ! hopefully no one saw it
im sorry about that . iv ##e gone through that before . laughter can be good medicine sometimes
what is it called ?
okay , well i guess i ' m happy for you then .
that ' s understand ##able . how rec ##eptive was he to your complaint ?
oh , so it got pretty serious . i guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries .
did you find anything ?
i bet that was very nos ##tal ##gic for you .
that ' s a hard hit to take . why do you suspect they got it ?
so what are you going to do about ? are you going to start looking for another place to work ?
what did you mess up ?
i ' m sure you ' ll be fine . have you made many similar mistakes in the past ?
i wouldn ' t worry too much about it then . don ' t let it get you down .
wow , that ' s nice . i hope you treated yourself to something extravagant !
i guess they didn ' t do as good a job as they should have , lo ##l . wish my car dealers ##hip had missed a few hundred bucks !
well , it was worth $ 500 ! that ' s about what my car ' s worth these days - had it for years . still runs great tho ' .
how fun ! in a tent or an rv ?
don ' t forget a first aid kit ! we always need those on camping trips !
u ##gh , that ' s so annoying . how long did you have to follow behind them ?
i hope you weren ' t late for anything important !
memory lane right there ! which cartoons ?
very cool i haven ##t seen the older style cartoons myself in years .
that would creep me out too what kind of calls ? ?
alright that would creep me out too . block the number or change yours ! ! weird .
uh oh . are you going to confront him about it ?
well i hope that he actually listen ##s to you this time and gets help .
congratulations , that ' s awesome ! i hope you ' re getting a raise too !
hope you treat yourself to celebrate , you deserve it !
that sounds amazing ! when will you find out ?
you sound positive so i am sure you will get it ! ! !
om ##g , that ' s so scary ! are you okay ? did you call the police ?
that ' s good to hear ! people are crazy
i bet . it is nice to have a day off every now and then
i like having days off to do abs ##ol ##ut ##ly nothing . it helps with stress .
that ' s the worst . is it damaging the curtains too much ?
is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him ?
that is great ! adopt , don ' t shop ! always a great motto !
that is great , i com ##men ##d you !
have you prepared enough for it ?
well im sure you be fine . just relax .
that ' s good to hear ! have you been eating healthy ?
that ' s great ! keep up the good work !
that ##s strange , my dog will eat anything lo ##l
maybe he will start warming up to it soon
about what ? !
that ' s awesome . i ' m glad she did well .
that ##s always a bum ##mer when you put in such work and get nothing in return
oh i just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually ! never been happier !
did you study for it or are you wing ##ing it ?
don ' t worry then . you did you part ! ! i ' m sure you will do fine !
maybe you should try and have a party ?
yes being alone is not very fun .
what will your new age be ?
you should have a great time , cong ##rat ##s on the new age !
i went through a similar thing a few years back . everything seemed hollow to me . how long has it been ?
if your depressed , speak to someone . if it ' s just adjusting to the change , that comes in time .
why is it that you are in trouble ?
can you just replace the document ?
i would be reporting that to the police for sure .
that ##s true right . . i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes . that ##s insane .
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . that must be very difficult for you and your family .
i am so sorry for your loss . i hope that you find peace in this difficult time .
that ' s great . what will you be doing at your new job ?
sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place , you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything .
aw man , that sucks . promotions usually aren ' t given fairly in my experience . was that the case for you too ?
i ' ll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time !
that is amazingly lucky ! good for you !
that is great ! i wish i was lucky like that !
aw ##h poor baby . . i am sure it ##ll get better now tho ! how old is he ?
u ##gh no ##oo ##o ! that ##s terrible i am so sorry . : (
i would be so excited ! did they pay you for it ?
hopefully ! that would be so amazing !
that sounds like such a fun , peaceful morning . so jealous you have a pool , it ' s been sc ##or ##ching outside !
ah okay , nice for the kidd ##os then . they grow up fast , so hold onto these moments while you can : )
aw , well when your younger you don ' t do those things on purpose . i think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then .
have you talked to her about it ? maybe she doesn ' t really think about it anymore .
i am so sorry to hear about your loss . what did he get you ?
that was very nice of him . i ' m glad you have a nice husband .
well better to be sooner than later on something like that . don ##t be hard on yourself .
that ##s so silly its none of his worry . he needs to hush up . lo ##l
wow ! he sounds like a super smart cat ! how did you get him out of there ?
well at least you managed to save him !
oh man , i ' ve definitely had a few cow ##or ##kers like that myself before . what does she even talk about ?
that ' s the worst ! some people , once they get started , they just can ' t stop themselves . it ' s like opening a can of pri ##ng ##les .
did it feel good to get it out ?
oh no , that ' s awkward ! did you get in trouble for it ?
that ' s heartbreak ##ing , but you ' re amazing for doing that . cats are my favorite and i ' ve rescued many animals . it ' s a lot of work .
yes , and when they love you it feels special , because they don ' t love everyone like dogs do . you ' ve rack ##ed up a lot of good karma for saving them !
i ' m there too . struggling each day . it really gets old .
yeah , that ' s right . i ' ve been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as i can remember . hold out , maybe it ' ll change .
you would be so su ##pr ##ised at how much stays all the way in the no ##ok ##s and cr ##ann ##ies of your brain when you take a break !
im glad it paid off for you , you must be super proud !
oh no , i am so sorry . what did you do ?
that is tough . that must have been quite the trying time . did you eventually find work ?
good , how long has it been since you saw them last ?
i hope you all have some fun .
oh yes , fall is definitely my favorite season as well ! i love fall scents !
it is the best season , by far ! plus , halloween !
oh man , those things are awful and reproduce like crazy . we left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere ! the best trick is putting a little apple cid ##er vinegar in a jar , a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cl ##ing wrap and put holes in it . they will gr ##avi ##tate toward it and you ' ll catch a bunch ! just keep changing it every few days .
seriously , gone is good . they do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and ve ##gg ##ies and the la ##rva burr ##ow into the fruit or ve ##gg ##ie so its good you trash ##ed it all . glad you ' re free of them !
that is so exciting ! it can be stress ##ful and expensive planning a wedding .
it really gets stress ##ful when you get down to the last minute . you are always so worried you are going to forget something .
oh that was nice of them
ha ##ha that ##s pretty fun
oh no , i am sorry to hear that . i hope that he gets to feeling better . how old is he ?
oh i see , i can understand your concern . perhaps he will live longer than most ham ##sters !
that is awesome ! i would be really excited if i were in y ##you ##r shoes !
i hope you go far in your job ! good luck !
that is quite upset ##ting . do you know what ai ##ls it ?
well i certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better . are you close friends with this canine companion ?
oh no , what happened ? hopefully the whole weekend didn ' t get ruined !
poor little thing , chicken po ##x are the worst . on the bright side , you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband , just not , you know , in the way you hoped . hope you guys get to have a make - up weekend soon !
wow that ##s nice . what do you drive ?
you have to think of the positive ##s . just because they have a new car doesn ##t mean their life is great . they could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are .
lo ##l and some day you might you buy your own new tesla , if you feel like it !
exactly !
oh that ##s nice
ye ##a i would be to
why ' s that ?
nostalgia is a weird feeling .
nice , what do you have planned ?
sound great , i ' m happy for you !
wow ! that must feel great ! you should be proud of this accomplishment . people can go their whole lives without ever being published !
congratulations ! i wish i could be published .
what are some things you will bring ?
it ' s a good idea to write thing down that you might forget .
what is wrong ? are you okay ?
i am so sorry . i hope you get all the help you need .
we have been getting a lot of rain as well . i have to mo ##w my lawn so much .
yeah i know what you mean . i can ' t wait for the rainy season to end .
oh my goodness , i ' ve almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it ' s terrifying . i ' m so glad you ' re alright !
di ##tto . it ' s not hard to do , and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules . i ' ll send good vibe ##s out so nothing bad happens to you in the future !
wow , congratulations ! have you guys set a date yet ?
oh i feel you , i used to work in the wedding industry . it ' s crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding .
i know exactly how that happens . sometimes the food is just too good to pass up .
well i say go for it . it is only your birthday once a year . the other 36 ##4 days can make up for it .
glad to hear you are having a good day . wish every day was like that .
that is true . it puts things in context .
that is really awesome ! that is so important to be involved in his life like that .
it does ! kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook .
that is frustrating , especially if the weather isn ##t ideal
that is unfortunate , im sorry that happened !
that isn ' t good . are you mad at your friend ?
are you going to get another cat ?
i feel the same way as well ! i get really excited thinking about decor ##ating and giving gifts !
i agree ! everything that surrounds christmas makes me smile and feel content . it makes me thankful for everything good in life !
that ' s a great outlook i think . we often lose focus of that very important fact .
that ' s inspiring to me . i will try to think more like that as well whenever i get stressed in life .
8 miles ! ? that ' s very impressive . i bet i could barely make it a mile !
have you been a long time runner before that ?
i can relate to that ! yeah , my wife with my credit card , lo ##l !
ha ##ha , i can understand the hesitation then . but was the vacation at least worth the money ?
that ' s something that takes a lot of con ##tem ##pl ##ation , because it ' s such a big decision to make . will the extra money be worth the extra work ?
oh wow , an additional 40 ##k is a lot ! i ' d be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large .
oh wow . i ' ll be honest and say it wouldn ' t be worth it for me ! what ' s an extra 40 ##k if you ' re never not at work to enjoy it ?
oh wow , i think it ' d take me much longer to not bust my butt ! that is impressive !
maybe she ' s more athletic than you think ! she might be better than you soon . better watch out !
awesome ! what kind ?
oh man those are super nice ! all electric is pretty neat
that ' s good on his part , how do you feel about it ?
that ' s awesome , and i agree , the job market is tough now a days . high paying or not .
oh that ' s no good . any special reason why they were late ?
that ' s a bad attitude to have . i hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there .
it will be okay . it ' s always hard making that step , but it ' s good for your health to do it .
i wish my insurance would give me something like that ! it ' s good to go anyway ##s .
have you studied for it ? always helps to prepare !
good luck , i ' m sure you will do fine !
hey everyone trips up a little . what you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that .
it ' s ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while , but you can ' t give in . be strong !
you only get to do it once ?
oh no . i hope it goes well for you . that ' s a lot of hard work .
cong ##rat ##s !
was it more than expected ?
that has happened to me , but with texts though lo ##l
did you apologize ?
lo ##l
what ' s wrong with it ?
can you fix it ?
that is great news . have you also been working out ?
has it been easy or hard to do that ?
did they notice it was missing ?
well at least you are attempting to be honest about it .
oh ##h wow ! are you excited ?
oh ##h that stink ##s . i don ##t blame you though
that ' s very creepy , did he say anything to you ?
those are definitely the scary types , they don ' t recognize social cues at all .
ou ##ch ! did she hurt it or is it a de ##gen ##erative thing ? i hope she can find help with physical therapy .
oh good . hopefully she ' ll try to fix it with physical therapy first . some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary . recommend that she get a second opinion . hope she resolve ##s it !
i ' ve never understood that , it ' s not like they can ' t afford to eat since they have a job ! do you know which cow ##or ##ker it was ?
next time bring your lunch in a bio ##ha ##zard bag , maybe they will leave it alone .
what did you do ?
you definitely can ' t be too careful these days
how do you know no one goes in if you aren ##t in there ?
ok
oh no ! that stink ##s . i ' ve never had a cat specifically because i ' ve never been good with the idea of being able to train them . plus it seems like you just get the one personality , and they never grow to like you . but i ' m biased .
yeah , i know they definitely suit some people . i actually now technically have one . . . my roommate wanted to get one , and i felt too bad to say no . and he actually is a pretty nice guy , mostly because he ' s been affection ##ate from the start . so , we ' ll see how it goes ! sorry again about your mat .
wow good for you ! i hope that it works out for you !
yeah and i bet the higher pay ##che ##ck will make the work worth it .
what ! first of all , are you alright ?
oh , well that ' s something , at least . i can ' t believe people are such coward ##s , though .
that ' s great . do they know ?
well that is awesome . i bet they won ' t let you down in the new positions either
i have never run a marathon
you can try your best and if you don ' t finish there is always the next one
well that ' s some sort of motivation lo ##l
congratulations ! what are you getting your phd in ?
oh gee ##ze , i didn ' t know i was talking to a genius . how long is the program ?
have you tried to talk to your teacher ?
what school is this you are talking about ?
that ' s pretty cool that you ' re motivated and excited to start it . most people would be scared and pro ##cr ##ast ##inating . you ' ll do great .
sounds like you have a plan laid out . it also sounds like you ' ve already accomplished so much . . you should be very proud . i ' m with you , i have over $ 40 , 000 in student loans . such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate . good luck !
i can understand that .
you must love him very much , that ' s good .
aw , it takes time ! making friends isn ' t always so easy so give it a little bit of time
the best thing to do is join clubs and get involved . you generally make friends by association !
that is really nice of you to do , not a lot of people help others like that anymore
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help , i will most likely bring it to you
ah dan ##g . . . sorry that happened to you . it stink ##s too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more , or who has better connections , and not actual merit . if you ' re good , i ' m sure you will get recognized at some point .
well , keep a good attitude . if you like the work and the job , hopefully that will be enough .
that ##s very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you
i would suggest moving on time heal ##s all wounds
did she say thank you ?
what a lovely woman , and you ' re lovely , too !
that ' s the worst ! what did you do ?
that sounds like a good idea . i hope you solve the problem quickly !
yeah , those were better times . brings back good memories .
well , maybe yours . mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day .
oh man . . i have had those too . . and where i am the one getting crap even though i do my job and everyone else ##s . . i hate sitting around at work . . . i either want to work or go home . i hope your boss knows your co - worker is lazy ?
i agree and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn ' t give you praise then i would quit as well or contact human resources ! this kind of stuff is not acceptable .
sounds like you ate a delicious dessert , what did you eat ?
that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
o ? that ' s a brave and noble decision .
that ' s hard but great of you to do , good luck .
where will you be shopping ?
nice ! do you have anything in specific you want to buy ?
ha ##ha ##h it w ##has happened to me it the worst thing
did you still eat it ? or did you throw it away
that ' s nice of them ! people stopped doing that for me once i got older . i miss them
well , i ' m happy for you : ) it shows that they care
that ##s horrible ! im so sorry to hear that . why would she do that ?
it depends , if you love her , you could try to work it out . or you could cheat on her too
o ye ##a ? i
i ' m trying to teach mine tricks myself * i think that ' s fun to watch !
i ' ve cheated on occasion . it ' s never right but it ' s easy . at least you ' re ashamed of it .
that ' s your decision to make , but i think it would at least put you in control of the situation .
that sounds fun . is it a special occasion ?
i understand . sticking with what you know seems safer .
you must be loving it
true that , you can ##t be too sure until you use it
tough week ahead . do you think you have met your expectations thus far ?
sounds good . your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self - esteem
oh no ! that has so happened to me before ! it was only by a couple dollars a month but i so needed those couple of dollars at the time . i would be ma ##aa ##dd ##d
call the bank and get it fixed asa ##p ! that ' s got to be so annoying for you !
i buy those like twice a year and never win .
wow ! that ' s awesome ! what did you do with it ?
hey , why not ? it ' s unexpected money !
yeah i feel like you get lucky once then it ' s all downhill from there .
where was she ?
does she have a new ex now ?
i would not put up with it either
i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing
i bet you are . what are you going to do ?
sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it
why is that
you will be alright buddy
what have you done this year if you don ##t mind me asking ?
that is great , well there is still time to go this year !
i love it when it ' s nice out . are you going to do something outside ?
that sounds great . a nice long walk in perfect weather . there ' s hardly anything better .
are you excited for him or jealous ? lo ##l
i feel you ! i know its hard having siblings sometimes ! go buy a toy car and park it on top of his .
can you report the caller ?
be sure to do it , otherwise they could keep hara ##ssing you
what class is it for ?
i never took chemistry . do you feel prepared for the test ?
that ' s great . have they always been as supportive as they are now
nice . what do you do for a living
have you thought about spraying your garden ?
perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
same here , i ' m in texas . where are you located
nice ! i used to live in st . paul , mn . weather ' s like a tun ##dra which is why i ' m down here
were you able to get inside fast ?
oh wow ! that would be annoying !
how did they get off work mid ##week ?
that would be nice but not fun that you don ' t have the same days off .
where is your favorite place to go ?
i can imagine , i hope you have a great time this year
i remember when my first child started , i was a nervous wreck .
so they don ' t even have teachers yet ? wow , that ' s crazy .
have you tried getting out and meeting new people ?
what about online friends ?
that would hurt my feelings . are you alright ?
i totally understand that . i ' m sorry .
that sucks ! did you have a spare on you ?
that is good to hear .
that ' s understand ##able . what kind of project was it ? were you involved ?
that ' s so generous of you . it ' s people like you that make the work week bear ##able !
that ' s okay , i ' m 25 and still in college . how did it go for you ?
that ' s awesome . i ' m glad it worked out well for you . : )
oh wow . i would have been so scared . more of a stranger than the storm
well that was nice . how long were you stuck there
did the ads bring up good memories i hope ?
i have absolutely no idea what bog ##lins are , but i ' m sure they were awesome !
sounds frightening ! was this off the coast of a beach or something ?
that is one of my greatest fears . did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape ?
great to hear that you made it out ok !
well , i can understand that . it ' s very hard to be on a very strict diet , without a break here and now !
well , i am sure you are disappointed , but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated . it ' s hard , i know !
is this a career change ?
oh hey , i ' m a nursing graduate ! it ' ll be difficult at first , but you ' ll get the hang of it .
aw , that sucks . did you give her a proper burial ?
aw ##w ##w ##w , i am so sorry . have you thought about getting a new pup ?
ye ##a , a new job is useless pretty stress ##ful .
it will be ok in the end .
oh that is a real bum ##mer . were you hurt ?
ok glad you did not get injured . i hope your car gets fixed .
sorry to hear that
well that ' s good . you never know what to say in that situation
i wish yo the best
that must of been fun to go through .
that is cool . is your mother still alive ?
what was ?
really ? did you manage to cope ?
and was there ?
good
im sorry to hear that
you ever ever plan to get another ?
really , how did they do it ?
amazing ! well done to him .
well done , at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now
heat wave is getting so terrible these ##s days . i even watched on cnn that the whole of new south wales is experiencing a drought , so sad
that sounds unfortunate . you must have been so annoyed with him !
people like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else !
do you have daughters of your own ?
why is that ?
ye ##a traffic sucks
well ye ##a that ##s true
same here . it reminds me of my childhood for some reason .
exactly , i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes .
i bet ! did it turn out nice ?
that ' s good . . . i can ' t wait for my vacation !
that ' s terrible ! did the dog survive ?
maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger . . . by beating him up !
what i do is to write all the good things i did within the week , i think you should do the same
i agree with you buddy
you must have prepared really well . did the trip go well ?
sounds like the trip went well . i am glad you enjoyed it !
all the time
its just life

aw well that is normal . i ' m sure she didn ' t want to leave . every day will get a little easier .
oh my goodness , that sounds terrifying .
i ' m glad that you are okay .
i bet that was quite the blast from the past

that must be really scary to go through .
that sounds like fun ! what happened ?

that seems like it would be a little awkward to me . .
well , they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out , that is really nice .
that ' s always a nice find .
i bet it was ! i love looking at photo albums
that is nice . did you start playing guitar with him ?
that is good .
i am also working from home from time to time . i could feel some time lonely .
i usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely .
oh , that must have been so embarrassing .
i ' m sorry it happens to us at times .
congratulations ! that is so cool !
i hope you have fun with that money .
i can ' t believe your cow ##or ##ker would do that to you ! did your manager listen ?
i wouldn ' t be either . are you going to try to talk to your cow ##or ##ker about it ?
oh wow ! i bet you all had a blast ! !
they will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it .
oh god , what do you do at that time
how did you feel at that time
oh wow ! are the babies ok ?
good thinking . i ' m sure the parent bun ##nies appreciated that .
oh man . what a bum ##mer ! i love cu ##cum ##bers and hum ##mus ! do you have anything else you ' re growing that survived ?
oh good , i ' m glad the entire garden didn ' t get ruined . i would love to plant a garden one day soon since i went vega ##n plant based about 3 months ago . happy tomato eating to you !
oh what a mess . i would hope that they picked it up .
well at least they cleaned up after . i would have been more annoyed if they didn ##t .
could you tell me what you have done ?
that sounds great , i hope you succeed .
that ' s great news ! cong ##rat ##s ! my garden is not doing great this year . do you grow anything else ?
yu ##m . i wish i had a green thumb .

i wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions
oh man ! hopefully nothing broke !
at least it sounds like you recovered everything !
he accused me of stealing from him
sorry , that was an error ! any way over to your conversation . who did you cut off that made you feel bad ?
ye ##a i hear ya . im stuck here at work for another day too .
i just hope it doesn ##t rain this weekend .
what is the test on ? have you prepared for it ? i bet you will do better than you think !
good for you ! i bet you will do amazing . best of luck !
i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse . i ' ve never been brave enough to go eat alone .
i get that . i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday .
me too ! i ' m stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there .
ha ##ha , same ! just one more hour for me . hope you can enjoy it soon !
that is not good , what happened
that is never a good thing , i hope they land on their feet
how did they do that ?
oh , well that is a nice surprise though !
that is nasty , how do they get away with that ?
exactly , i would report them , so nasty
how so ?
i hope so too , get it checked out !
sorry to hear that . it would really upset me to be in that situation !
i hope you win that one ! good luck !
i am sorry for your loss , at least you got some time together
i feel that way about my grandma , it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old
i think l ##y ##ft is better
i would hate that
where to ?
oh , i am sorry to hear that , why did they move away ?
they sounds very complicated
that is nice to have
having friends over is always nice !
i bet . hope you all have a fantastic time !
how do you feel about that ?
are you guys in good relations ?
did it bring back a lot of old mer ##mori ##es ?
that ##s good that you have progressed
she is a crap ##py person , flirting with someone who is in a relationship . good on you - stand up guy
lo ##l - well poor you . i have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me . if i am in a relationship . . or heck even when i am not . . i don ' t get interested in random people generally . i have to know who someone is . . remember that - what lasts is who someone is . . . someone you want to grow old with . . bodies won ' t last .
that must of been weird . who was it ?
was it suppose to scare you ?
that ##s awesome
well i hope it lasts forever
that ' s good ! i guess you studied a lot ?
that ' s good . i am sure you will do great on it .
ou ##ch , that sounds pretty gross !
i ' d avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance .
i hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up .
yes , don ' t let that stop you . also pay attention to what you eat as well . it ' s even more important than the exercise portion .
i don ' t know whether that ' s a good or bad thing . which is it ?
that ' s great ! it ' s definitely a good thing when you can be yourself .
what was it i wonder ?
it must ' ve been nasty like pu ##ke
i like that philosophy . here lately , has it been easier or harder to stay positive ?
i like that , how long have you felt this way about life ?
wow , its good to warm
it is easier to walk around when its sunny also
what exactly did he do >
yes , some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs .
wow ! i bet you two are very excited !
that is wonderful . our first vacation after getting married was full of fun , sun and adventure . those are the best !
you sound very confident . that ' s good
i know what you mean . just believe in yourself
is he being too noisy ?
i see how that can be annoying , have you asked him to stop doing that ?
you weren ' t excited about it ?
i understand . stress is a definite mood killer
iv ##e always wanted to have the eye surgery . im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts
im glad you feel happy about it
it ' s good to believe in good things .
yes , i like your attitude .
it ' s true there ' s nothing like the good old days
i ' m glad you were one of them !
i know how you feel . do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport ?
i hope you enjoy your adventures !
i hear you . i had the same experience after just 5 years
i understand . she took my daughter with her
what subject are you trying to pass ?
i love math , good luck with your exams than .
why were you acting like that ?
i ' m glad you were in a good mood .
did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way ?
i understand how that can make you feel a certain way . unfortunately , there are those types of people around every corner .
oh wow ! 20 years at your job ! you must be well liked there .
it must have been a wonderful surprise for you .
oh my goodness , what was the terrible news ?
i am so sorry , i hope your brother ended up being okay .
dan ##g , that ' s not good . what did you end up doing ? ?
oh wow . did the police get called ? i hope you didn ' t get in trouble .
yeah ? what is changing ?
brilliant . here are you going ?
amazing ! and exotic
that ' s so generous of you . the world could use more people like you .
caring for both the young and the old . any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff !
oh my , how did she react ?
ha ! do you feel bad about it ?
it certainly can . what type of job are you looking for ?
maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
i know that feeling . something will come through though
yes ! i feel like the day escaped me . have you done that recently ?
it is friday , that would be a nice way to start the weekend !
u ##gh i can imagine . but your time will come , be patient !
have you tried yoga ? it can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation .
oh no ! did you get the surgery ?
but you have recovered now . right ?
are you pregnant ?
congratulations ! that ' s brilliant news
good job ! do you feel proud of yourself ?
hard work always pays off ! keep it up .
what did you do ?
man ! that ' s pretty bad .
i hope it goes well for her
good luck !
awesome ! glad that you did well on the exam !
now you can celebrate this exam result ! always feels good to accomplish something like this .
oh wow . that is some scary stuff ! ! what happen ##d ?
did they catch the person ?
you shouldn ' t like to your mom . i think you should tell her the truth about what really happened .
that sounds like a great idea !
oh no ! you have to have a tough mental ##ity when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
that ' s good ! practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed , we would not have as much as we do today
that ' s terrible . did you let others know that you had completed the job ?
i could imagine . some people st ##oop low to take credit for what others do .
what kind of surgery was it ?
that ##s awesome ! its great to have friends their for someone .
oh no ! did you sc ##old him ?
i ' d be angry too , but it ' s hard to get mad at dogg ##os .
cong ##rat ##s to you ! what kind of nurse are you looking to be ?
i have no doubt that you will be a great rn !
that is awesome , what is his secret ?
being debt free can be a great feeling
im sorry to hear that . does she have a job now ?
well that was nice of your boss . its great to have good people in this world
are you excited for it ?
i hope this is the true love for you
you got this just be yourself and professional obviously and don ' t over think it .
you will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store .
it sounds like you are a great parent . does she appreciate all the help you give ?
she will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too . i still remember my dad helping me with math homework and can ##t thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years .
im sorry about that . how did you find out ?
that stink ##s . are you still with her or did you leave her ?
whoa that is really cool . did you train him to do that ?
that is amazing . must be a very smart dog .
i understand ! as we get older , it ' s hard to do it all everyday !
it happens , but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you
oh no , are you able to afford the repair for it ?
what a great friend you have . def ##ini ##tly get him a gift when you are done .
i hope you can too . how is it going ?
that ' s great ! i have faith that you can do it .
that ' s really good ! do you think you ' re ever going to use the card again ?
that is wise . i too am trying to pay off my credit card debts . after that , i ' m cutting them up .
that would have really scared me .
i bet you are thankful that your friend was there .
all of it ? ? ? oh no . how bad do you feel right now ?
ha ##ha i bet . im sure they were looking forward to it .
e ##w ##w ##w .
why would it be in the house to begin with ? does the dog po ##op in the house ?
you are having trouble with family ?
mine isn ' t either . are you married ?
awesome ! what are you going to see ?
whatever it is , i hope you have a good time !
oh no ! how ' d you do that ?
what were you doing on the roof ?
did you catch anything ?
did you at least have fun ?
cong ##rat ##s ! you must be proud !
my daughter is only in e ##ig ##th grade we have a while to go
that is good to feel that way . you don ' t want to feel like someone close to you would let you down . did it work out for you ?
oh i am sorry . that is sad . remember that it is not your fault . i would think of the people who have been there for you .
oh go ##sh , you also scared of bugs ? ? that ' s my worst fear
i would have a heart attack !
i have no idea what those are !
oh ok . i like ravi ##oli is it like that ?
what are pier ##og ##ies ? a type of food ?
ah nice , i love dump ##lings , what are in them ?
that ' s no good , did you throw it out ?
hope you don ' t get sick ! that would be a bad start to the weekend .
oh , i am so sorry . it has to be the most difficult thing to have to do . i had to do that with my gorgeous lab - i still miss him !
indeed they are . and so are many cats - the farm i used to live on has a ginger tom . he ' s quite the character and used to visit me regularly !
this fell ##a is called oliver . he ' s a big old soft ##ie who is ace at catching go ##pher ##s . he would bring half eaten ones to my door !
oh , i shouldn ' t be un ##grate ##ful , lo ##l ! at least he kills them before delivering them . a friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bath ##tub !
did you get a promotion ?
wow , great job !
oh no ! what has you scared ?
it ' ll be okay i promise . first few days will be weird but you ' ll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule .
oh dan ##g that ##s so horrible
it gets better with time but it must be hard
i remember that store ! i loved going shopping there , was it your first job ?
yeah , i bet , it looked like a fun place to work . especially for a college job .
are you having any specific problem areas ?
okay . i hope you do well too .
interesting , those things are huge , do they even make them any more ?
do you have a large family , or do you just like the idea of a large suv ?
5 is fairly large i would say . i hope you get your giant car one day .
it is a big change . what is scar ##ing you ?
i hate bugs too . you should ex ##ter ##minate before you move in
is it really far ?
oh no . im sorry to hear that
well , that would be terrifying ! were you afraid that a vampire was there ?
well , that would be very creepy ! they would hear my scream in the next town over !
you were ready ? that ' s good to hear .
awe ##oms ##e . treat yo self . gi ##f
are you prepared ?
i bet . good luck to you
where you supposed to be there ? if so , then that is a nice feeling .
oh i see . that could make the time go slow also .
that ' s great . what classes are you taking ?
that ' s pretty cool . . . are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming ?
you should go all out and get a ee degree to go with it . you can do micro ##pro ##ces ##sor design .
any time . have a good weekend : d
did that happen tonight ?
well , it must ' ve been something you said .
did she have a party ?
does she have her license yet ?
well , there ' s no hurry in driving , is there ? what does she do mostly on her phone ? text ? ?
does she play any sports ?
that ' s super frustrating ! i ' ve only ever had outside pets so i can ' t really offer advice , but it ' s one of those things where your anger is all mis ##placed because you know you can ' t really be upset with the dog since it doesn ' t know any better .
it ' ll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it , but ur ##gh . bathroom problems are why i don ' t think i want a kid anytime soon !
you got a present ? how lovely ! what was the occasion ?
well , happy anniversary ! what was your present ?
i agree . . did something happen ?
i ' m sorry . . not everyone is bad . just a lot of people .
that was nice
do you have anything in mind ?
so , i take you left to live someplace else ?
just remember to never invite you ex - room ##ate to your new place , ever ! ! ! ! ! !
very nice , cong ##rat ##s on making it that far . i actually was in the same situation about a week ago . how do you feel you match up to the others ?
i would be upset too . however , i wouldn ##t get discouraged though . there may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon .
that ' s great , it ' s good to see people finish what they start . you must be very proud .
well , hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future .
i am so glad to hear that . did he find a job ?
that is good to hear . what will he be doing ?
oh that ' s wonderful ! how long have you two been dating ?
it ' s a huge step , congratulations !
sometimes deaths affect us even when we ' re not really close .
guilt can be a terrible thing to live with .
is he sick or just being lazy ?
i hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more .
oh , well that ' s awful on a little person ! i never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom !
lo ##l , well , that ' s good to know . so am i !
is your patient improving an following good medical advice ?
that would be a surprise . a lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition , especially those with diabetes .
that ##s . . . uh . . . strange ?
i think so , you ' re two peas in a pod .
pets are great , but they can be a bit needy for attention at times . it is great , but not when you are busy and trying to get things done .
a walk will definitely help . he will probably be ready for a nap when you get back , then you can get some work done .
oh my god ! that ' s terrible !
oh that ' s so great !
that ' s amazing ! congratulations ! swimming can be tough
lo ##l i bet you use that line all the time ! i love it
oh man ! i hope no one noticed .
i ' m glad that it all worked out !
oh , i bet you are really torn .
i ' m sure he will love that . i bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes .
that ' s one of the hardest parts of life . what happened ? ?
that is hard ! relationships are hard work .
that is great of them , did you do anything to pay them back ?
that is nice of you , glad you have supportive friends !
aw poor mouse . i have had a few before . . we actually rescued a few from our cat : /
they have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks . mice really are sweet nature ##d .
what happened to them ?
good , sorry you were inc ##on ##ven ##ience ##d , hope things get more consistent !
that sounds like fun . for some reason kids really enjoy cooking .
that sounds like fun . i want to try to make mo ##zz ##ere ##lla
did you study for it at least ?
that is true , well best of luck to you friend !
that is bad . what did you do after that ?
did he say sorry ?
what show was it ?
is that the one with bryce dallas howard ?
oh ? what about them ?
that ' s true . any memory in particular ?
is it really ? how hot is it there ?
that is hot , but it is a bit hotter where i live here
did you feel lonely , or were you happy to have some time to your ##el ##f ?
that is tough when you ' re not used to being alone . what did you end up doing ?
oh that ' s cool ! what do you all have planned ?
well that sounds like a fun little trip .
that ##s nice to be able to relax
everyday is a good day !
really ? you must really like you job then
good for you ! i hope you have good week !
awesome ! i am happy for you !
i am sure you will do fine ! good luck !
oh i am so sorry . best thing to do is be there for her .
i have and it really hard . it just takes time but a good support system makes it way better .
how did she handle it
well that was nice of you
did it help ?
cong ##rat ##s ! i hope it works out
that was good of you . he didn ' t hurt her did he ?
oh no ! ! ! where did you end up going ?
that was so awesome of your mom : )
why did they do that ?
that is terrible . those days , a lot of people do stupid things .
children usually do really well , they are versatile .
i hope he continues to do well .
are you excited or will it be lonely ?
yeah that is scary . i am sure she will do great things though !
i bet it was really quiet and lonely . did you find some time for yourself though ?
i don ' t think i would like that quiet either .
well that ' s not good . i ' m sorry to hear that . do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test ?
never be too confident ! you ' ve got to give life your all at every step .
i agree . i don ##t know why they work in the service industry if they don ' t like to be nice
fast food employees are the worst sometimes . . . it ' s like we bother them
how exciting ! ! ! i bet you are thinking already about how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn , etc . .
i can imagine ! it is certainly an exciting time . i bet you are just over the moon happy !
any experience with what ?
yes some things
are you trying to save money by not eating out at work ?
well , it can save you a bunch of money ! plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break .
oh my ! i bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there .
yi ##kes ! why in the world would somebody do that ?
whoa ! that is really scary ! i ' ve felt weird sensations like that before .
no ! i ' m sure you are not as monster - is ##h as you think !
aw that ' s n ##nic ##e of her
mom ##s are the best
did you kill the snake ?
that is too bad , will you ever camp again ?
did they do a good job ?
did you take them out for drinks after the meeting ?
sounds awesome
i would have loved to do the same
did you resolve things ?
i hope you can get over that pain .
that ' s awesome ! it would be amazing to win a million one day . one can dream .
that ' s great . i hope you do ! maybe this time you can get $ 40 . but gamble only in mode ##ration !
that is really upset ##ting !
well forget them ! if they don ' t care about you you don ' t need to care about them
for fun ?
well that sounds pretty fun !
were you satisfied with the results ?
excellent !
how did it go
oh well maybe next time
how many days has it been ?
wow that ##s great !
drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general .
some people can ' t hold their liquor .
i can imagine . what happen ##d that you got your jaw wired ?
man that sounds awe ##ful .
nice . always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can ' t touch you
absolutely
i feel like everyone goes through that phase . i know i did too
would you say you ' re more of an intro ##vert ?
especially in the south
oh wow , that does sound horrible
did you find out the results ?
dan ##g that ##s awesome !
oh wow and you couldn ' t keep your job ? what were you going to school for ?
oh wonderful ! one of the best fields to be in right now
wow ! good luck , there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too !
that is awesome . i never even get a second date a husband may not be in the cards lo ##l
that ##s sweet . i bet they enjoyed it
i hate bad traffic , did you get in an accident ?
that ' s the worst , i hate when people are careless .
i know what you mean
that sucks . have you talked to her ?
that is awful . i agree . a professional setting is supposed to be . . . well , professional . what steps are being taken to correct that ?
i agree . i hope it will be . team building , communication , and professional ##ism will all help a company . i think this is why so many companies fail .
wow , you do really live far from your parents . do you go to college or work ?
i see . well , it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past . nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life
i can see how that would be a down ##er . will you still get to see them ?
at least they aren ' t gone completely , but i can understand how that would affect your day to day work life .
i would be really annoyed myself , why so many frequent calls ?
i know ever since i purchased a new car , i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance company ##s call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying
i know right ! my parents love tennis , so i gr ##w up watching it .
were you ever any good at it ?
good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of . can you ba ##ke now for real ?
are you still in contact with him ?
oh that sucks . i hate when that happens .
i bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one .
that sounds exhaust ##ing ! were you driving for work or just taking a vacation ?
i ' m sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family .
was he alone ?
cool . did you do something special ?
cong ##rat ##s
do you get a raise ?
probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
are you interested in mortgage for now ?
oh that is really gross ! have you talked to her about it ?
if you share the fridge , i ' d let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food .
cool . did he have gifts ?
oh . i am lo ##l
like what ? bad or miserable ?
yes indeed . seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
wow . enjoy your own time .
yeah , you ' re right . hope you ' ve memorable vacation .
wa ##o , that ##s really not cool
he doesn ##t deserve you , so wipe your tears
that ' s sad . but i ' m sure they stil want to be fire ##nds with you too
po ##si ##bly . sounds like you are better off without him though
that ' s awesome , i wish i could build my own house .
well thank you as well .
did she die recently ?
oh wow ! that ##s so sad , i know animals can be like kids to use . i ' m so sorry
that can ruin a persons life .
that is such a mess .
tell me more , sounds exciting !
good on you ! you finally got recognition for your hard work
oh no what happened ?
what concert was it ?
that probably would have been fun .
that sounds terrible . i hope you ' re okay now .
well all the matters is that no one was hurt . you can buy property again but not lives .
that is so messed up !
i would be so angry .
oh wow , what kind of dog was it ? i ' m so sorry that must ' ve been super hard
i can imagine . i haven ' t had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and i ' m dread ##ing the day
that ' s wonderful that you are pursuing a degree . what is it in ?
that is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others . you can really make a difference !
yeah ? which game was it for ?
nice . the original spy ##ro is a classic .
oh no . what did you do ?
lo ##l , well done for attempting it . did you make it to work on time ?
that ' s great . what made it so special this year ?
sounds like fun ! i ' m glad you had a happy birthday .
i am so happy for you ! cong ##rat ##s !
i wish you nothing but the best !
it sounds like you ' re talking about two different people there instead of just one person . i ' m a little confused .
ou ##ch that sucks . i ' m sorry to hear that .
why what happened ? are y ' all on a trip ?
oh wow , so he basically ghost ##ed you ? i would be mad too
that sounds very bizarre .
i hope you are okay .
that is so messed up !
i hope this doesn ' t happen again .
oh my , what did you do , may i ask ?
that does not sound good . it must have been so embarrassing !
oh no , what happened ?
i hate public speaking too !
dallas is a really fast city .
i ' m sorry , things will get better .
what are your plans ?
that ##s awe ##os ##me ! is he going to be staying with you ?
that is terrible . what happened then ?
i understand . my mist ##ask ##e always happened .
those are so stress ##ful . just take it step by step and you can get on track .
that makes all the difference . i am glad you were able to get out of that position .
you must be really excited for it ! do you think its going to be girl or boy ?
well , it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy !
do you plan do something this weekend ?
yes . it is sometime nice to just rest at home .
that sounds like fun do you know who haunt ##s it ?
well , if you promised i would try to go . i ' m sure it ' ll be fine .
nice ! you must be pretty confident she will say yes .
i hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both .
that sounds terrible . but hopefully it isn ##t suffering any more .
i agree , just remember her for all the good memories .
have you been studying ? that is intimidating but i bet you ' ll do great ! what ' s the subject ?
what an interesting course ! i hope you do really well . exams can be so scary - they can cause such anxiety .
that is very bad . did you complaint to the landlord ?
i understand . the best thing is to move .
that ' s awful ! i ' m always scared that ' s going to happen to me when it ' s raining
you got lucky for sure ! i can ' t imagine how scary that would be
really , where was this parade at ? i ' m in missouri and it was absolutely pouring on friday
i usually don ' t let a little rain stop me unless it ' s ridiculous !
oh no . feeling empathy towards them just shows you ' re normal . there ' s a lot of people in your boat
what ##s preventing you ?
you sound too kind . you ' d be a great dog mother / father !
that sounds fun ! what are they exactly ?
it sounds like you really enjoy it ! good for you !
how exciting ! she must be thrilled too
i hope you guys have the best time !
that unfortunate . are you feeling a little jealous ?
i hate it when stuff like that happens .
ha ##ha , no ##oo ##oo . . . don ' t do that . there are too many of those people in the world as it is .
sounds like the best course to me : )
that sounds so great . being in nature makes you feel so good .
you should just make a plan and do it . it sounds like it is worth ##while .
that sucks , sorry to hear that . did you get a ref ##und ?
hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there !
did it taste good ?
did it taste good ?
were you su ##pr ##ised that they did this for you ?
wow ! how happy you must be . i be that day brought you lost of excitement .
you must have great co workers . i bet your happy everyday you go to work
oh so sad , what happened to it
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family
yes , he be rest in peace
i would be so scared . i think i might have to leave . did the bears bother anyone ?
were you in a tent or a camp ##er ? i hope you kept your food locked up tightly .
glad everyone is safe ! you were very smart .
oh , i ' m so sorry to hear that . i know pets can be like one of the family .
you should adopt a rescue dog . that would be great for the family .
that ' s disgusting . what did you do about it ?
did you get a ref ##und at least ? i would never visit that restaurant ever again if i were you !
that ' s interesting ! most kids love being home - school ##ed but i guess she missed social ##izing and interacting with her peers .
not too much longer ! i hope she adjust ##s well and enjoys herself . public school can still provide an en ##rich ##ing experience when it comes to social skills and education .
wow good job ! so close
that ##s a great accomplishment
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
i agree . you need to social ##ize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
that should be fun . good luck !
aw that ' s annoying . work always gets in the way of things . did you ever try to go to her ?
i ' m sure it will work out ! not this time un ##fort ##una ##tly , but it will in the end
did he take care of it for you ?
that is great that he was able to show you he is responsible . i bet you ' re proud .
that ' s awesome , what does your hub ##ster do ?
wow , i admire his dedication ! and you won ' t ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking !
hard work pays off in the long - run . if your work is truly authentic in its nature , it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
be careful while negotiating your pay raise . some managers may find it too int ##rus ##ive and that may leave bad impression on them
oh no , do you think she was trying to get back at you for ground ##ing her ?
i definitely remember trying something like that when i was a kid . i think sometimes kids think they ' re sneak ##ier than they actually are .
who ##w ! that sounds really disgusting ! what did you do ?
man , you are a good friend ! i would have been beyond angry !
so sorry to hear that . it is truly ho ##rri ##fying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this cal ##ami ##ty
indeed . friends should be together in times of need . that is what friends are for
oh no ! ! did anyone notice ? it ' s normal though , we all do that sometimes
oh man . . . it happened to me before , i know how embarrassing it is .
that ' s great that he passed though ! are you happy about it ?
well at least he passed - that ' s great !
that is pretty neat actually . i wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that .
i will do that , i had no idea .
i ' m really sorry to hear that .
i can ' t even imagine to be honest .
i have lost grandparents and great ##par ##ents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with .
i ' m sure it will be different when it ' s a parent .
that ' s awesome ! i hope you will get a promotion . what do you do for work ?
you will be a great manager ! good luck with every ##thi ##g
you took a risk huh ? i hope he will be a great worker ! that ' s good you gave him a chance
i hope it won ' t happen !
oh no ! did he say anything about it ?
i know what you mean . i ' ve done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly , don ' t you !
awesome ! what are you planning on buying ?
maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something !
oh no that is crazy !
well i ' m sorry you are going through this and i hope you can figure it all out .
i hate those things , i try to not eat those at all .
i eat steak and shrimp .
i really dislike s ##no ##ot ##y people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face .
i wouldn ' t be friends with someone like that . i mean what can you benefit from that friendship ?
agreed . you really won ' t be missing out on anything worth ##while .
i love taylor swift ! she ' s talented and beautiful !
how exciting for you ! have fun !
you have a test coming up ?
well i hope you do well ! good luck .
that ' s interesting . what was she doing ?
that ' s awesome ! i didn ' t know that place was still in business .
yeah i bet it is frustrating . the store gets rei ##mb ##urse ##d for the coup ##ons so they should not ni ##tp ##ick .
i hope they get better training so you don ' t have to argue with them about it
too old for what ? what a strange thing to say .
that doesn ' t make much sense . maybe i am missing the context .
oh no , he shouldn ' t have gamble ##d .
i would ' ve too , but sometimes people need to learn a lesson .
oh no ! did you property get broken into ? or your neighbor ' s property ?
for real ! are you taking any precautions ?
inside the restaurant ? what kind of place was this ?
okay , that makes more sense then to me .
where are you located ?
i wasn ' t even aware there was a hurricane .
who did what ?
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that . people are so inc ##ons ##ider ##ate !
oh no ! why not ? !
i would make a complaint to the principal if i were you !
never know who was ?
wow that is awe ##ful !
oh wow , what happened ?
that would give me the creep ##s ! has anyone seen anything there ?
i bet it was . i ' ve only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in west virginia . i ' m very careful to avoid those places these days !
good for you ! there is nothing wrong or un ##co ##ol about short hair .
great ! i ' m glad that it worked out well for you !
that ' s awesome , i went to visit my parents and my hometown last month , it is a great feeling . how was the fair ?
brings back all the memories you had as a kid . i miss going to the state fair , was always fun .
you must have been sad and angry .
yes first heart brake is so hard , i feel for you , something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend .
that ' s awesome ! congratulations !
no way ! that ' s actually a super awesome prize ! have fun
ou ##ch , hopefully its not by much . i remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation . they ' re usually pretty len ##ient on it .
i ' m sure your dad wouldn ' t mind ha ##ha , its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $ 1 .
did you try to get the money from him ? he sounds like a pretty bad person .
i do too ! people like that make me never want to have a roommate !
oh wow . that ' s pretty scary . i would be horrified .
well , at least they didn ' t follow you . how is cuba ? my parents are from there but i ' ve never been .
oh no ! that ' s sad , did he get them all ?
aw , that ' s too bad , hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop !
wow , so what are you going to do with it ?
nice , i hope that works out for you . . . good luck
that is gross , i can ' t even imagine what that would taste like !
that ' s so gross , i would take a hard pass on eating that . i like seafood but that ' s too much .
om ##g , thankfully he wasn ' t hurt .
did ya ##ll happen to get it on video ?
cong ##rat ##s ! , i ' m sure you must be very happy !
ha ##ha brother ##ly love , i hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together !
that ##s amazing i can ##t wait to have my own one day
i bet so !
is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week ?
that can be stress ##ful . i am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you ! just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away !
we all do stuff like that . at least you didn ' t lock them inside your car . done that before !
yeah nothing like calling the locks ##mith and admitting you are not very bright . ha ##ha .
did you not want to go out , or did you just not like the movie ?
just be careful with that . if you feel tired due to stress , it may be the stress talking and not you .
great , when will you know your scores ?
wow , that ' s fantastic .
who doesn ' t ?
what a jerk ! that is definitely a problem !
that ' s a real bum ##mer . do you at least pass the class ?
well at least you don ' t have to take it again . could have been worse .
oh no , how awful for you ! i hope people helped you to pick them up ( and didn ' t help themselves ! ) .
glad you find humor in it ! i dropped a bottle of water once , which rolled under the car . i was liv ##id !
that ' s extremely frustrating ! what were they expecting you to do ? it ' s not your fault your roommate left it trash ##ed .
well , i guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you . but that blows , how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave ?
that is so annoying . they should not call it that if they can ' t guarantee 10 minutes .
hopefully the food was at least worth the wait . i would have been annoyed as well .
oh god ! i haven ' t had a puppy in a long time , but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy - proof . they find ways to make mess ##es in the most creative ways .
yeah , that ' s a real headache . i ' d want to say they ' re worth it , but on that day i wouldn ' t be so sure , ha ##ha .
that is a huge blessing , i don ' t know about you but my life is pretty much key ##ed into my phone .
it ' s almost a shame how much we depend on them , but i know i ' d be lost without mine .
do they run them all day long - or at night ?
is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area ? i know in ours unless they are still running them at 11 ##pm , there is nothing the police will / can do about it unfortunately - but i can imagine how annoying it is .
i don ' t blame you because i hate camping .
oh i hate tick ##s and all the bugs .
what happened ?
you are lucky to have such great friends !
oh that sucks , i hope it has healed since then
ou ##ch , that sounds awful
how come ? have you had awful weather lately ?
oh i see . beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day !
oh ? big decision . i hope you feel good about it !
aw , but they ' ll always be there for you when you visit . you have to do what you want to in life , after all
oh that sucks ! what did your neighbor do to get you angry ?
how inc ##ons ##ider ##ate . people should have more common sense than your neighbor .
that ##s awesome , i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them
me too !
i hate when i get teachers that are clue ##less . makes you wonder how they got the job .
well done . you should feel proud for teaching yourself .
that ' s always a great start to a day .
how are you celebrating it ?
oh wow . what ' s the exam on ?
that ' s really great . i am sure you will do well on the test .
oh no , what happened ?
well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that . hopefully he didn ' t hurt anyone else .
congratulations ! retail really does suck .
understand ##ably . my girlfriend is a student and works in retail part - time . she says the same thing .
oh , all the time . what album is that for you ?
i really love that album ! we will have to listen to it together sometime .
that sucks . did she make a lot of money off of it ?
i would ' ve been very angry too . i hope the money went towards something useful .
i am sorry to hear that . why was it a bum ##mer ?
that really stink ##s . i bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret .
that must feel very refreshing . would you say you feel content ?
nice ! i want to get that game next week . looks really cool .
that is disappointing . i wonder why he ' s like that .
i hope he doesn ' t let you down .
something good happen to him recently ?
that ' s amazing ! tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger .
oh no , that ' s not good ! he ' s not the only one that ' s not great at french . most of my family spoke french as a second language when i was growing up and i still never picked it up !
hopefully he ' ll get to enjoy his next summer .
that sucks . did anyone get hurt ?
i bet . i would ' ve hid under the table .
that ' s nice . why do you say that ?
that ' s great to hear . i wish i had a helpful family .
that ' s really selfish . have you talked to her about it ?
well , at least that ' s the case . people can only do so much .
oh yeah ? why is that ?
well sometimes that isn ' t a bad thing really . you didn ' t enjoy it at all ?
are the good memories at least ?
at least you have those memories . you should go on a vacation soon !
which one ?
i ' ve actually haven ' t played that series . when does it come out ?
that ' s rough . why can ' t you help her ?
yeah , i am in the same boat . it ' s a hard knock life out there .
how long did it take them ?
he must of been sick after .
that was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
wow , that ##s insane . i feel like that ##s illegal
what was the news ?
are you going to ground him ?
why don ' t you join them ?
why don ' t you get another job ?
that ' s too bad . what happened ? is everyone ok ?
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that . i ho ##ep your family is strong enough to support you through this .
holy cow . was anything missing ?
had they gone through anything ?
oh yeah that must have been a good time
those are the best times when they still like to play with toy ' s mine lost interest years ago and i miss it
that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation , where do you have planned to go ?
that sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
i miss her . you haven ' t seen your mom in a long time ?
i ' m sorry , but i can ' t understand what you ' re saying .
oh man ! i have been there , i hope you didn ' t have anything special down there ? ?
oh lord , i am so sorry ! i have been there , that is hard !
ta ##ht sounds like fun , i wish i had cow ##or ##kers that nice ah ##aha ##h . did you enjoy the party ?
ah ##aha ##ah seems to be they really like you working th ##rer ##e
aw ##w , i ' m sorry . is he going to be ok ?
i do too . that ' s one of the sad ##des ##t things . i hope you ' ll be ok too .
wow nice
o ##oop ##s sorry to hear that
oh that sucks . . did someone move it out of the way ?
ye ##a you never like to see stuff like that .
did you try to find its owner ?
well that was nice of someone
that ' s annoying , are you going to talk to them about it ?
i hope it all works out in the end .
awesome ! can you say what kind of project it is ?
i hope so too ! projects can be stress ##ful !
what is the appointment for ?
let ' s hope not ! my prayers are with her .
you ' re welcome . it ' s always nerve wreck ##ing when family is sick like that .
i think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment .
oh man , sounds like most kids . she ' s gonna hate it at first , but getting to bed early will help with her future .
well ye ##a , they ' re young right now and can ' t see the consequences yet .
that is so lucky , they must be so happy they bought that ticket
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry ha ##ha ##ha
what kind of test is it
oh i hope you do well then
wow i didn ##t even know they had cruises that go on for that long
ye ##a i wonder how much something like that costs . . i guess if you have to ask you can ##t afford it as they say
that is really nice of him , how much time will you have to wait ?
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
that is horrible , natural disaster are the worst because you can ##t do anything against them
not really , the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunder ##storm
i bet that was a wonderful day
i am very happy for you
that is not good , have you expressed your feelings to your boss ?
well i hope everything goes well for you , you will sure find something fitting for you don ##t worry
it ' s a whole new world when that happens , i can totally understand . how ' d you cope with it ?
it ' s always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen . it ' s the best way to learn .
oh no , that ' s bad . have you had someone come out and check the hose ?
may be worth letting your ins ##ru ##ance coma ##p ##ny know . usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won ' t cover any of it .
what is that ?
oh that explains it !
wow when the child just asked ? !
i ' m only afraid that the mom is going to let out that em ##bara ##ss ##ment on her child once they get home .
om ##g that ' s so gross !
that would be a memorable lesson to learn . the best lessons are learned that hard way , after all .
oh god . that ' s kinda gross .
rest in peace whoever touches that rack .
oh dear . how do they let the parents know what ' s going on ?
that sounds really frustrating . i ' m sorry that ' s happening !
oh wow . terrifying . all i think of is johnny er ##ric ##son tad ##a , who broke her neck in that situation . did you do it ?
you did the right thing ! oh fun ! i ' m glad you were safe and had a blast !
do you feel ready for it ?
awesome , hope it goes as planned !
oh how exciting ! did you take any pictures ?
aw ##w ##w . . . that ' s a bit disappointing , but really cool that you got to see them !
the market can be competitive if the price is right . they ' ll sell im ##media ##tley .
that would have been awesome if you got it .
that ' s good ! that probably means you worked on it until it became something you ' re proud of .
maybe i could learn from that . i get really nervous when i have to do any public speaking , so maybe if i just prepared for it better it would help .
what did they do to you ?
it happens sometimes . you may ask them directly to pay back .
i totally get that . i ' m in the same place with my daughter . i home school and she ' s learning them too . give it time and she ' ll get it soon . its so much to memo ##rize at once !
that ' s awesome ! she will ! the best thing about homes ##cho ##olin ##g is that they can learn more at their own pace . i ' m not looking forward to division ! ha ha
do you hike very often ?
i ' ve never been hiking , really ! i ' d like to go some day .
oh , such fun ! do you have all the stamp it up scrap ##book ##ing things i hear so much about ? i bet it can be hard to keep it updated ! they grow so fast !
perfect ! now you ' ll be caught up in no time . i know you ' ll be so gr ##ati ##fied to finish and be able to look at all of them when he ' s much older .
so sorry to hear of sam ' s passing .
may your many memories of sam help you to sustain at this difficult time .
that is awesome . i ' m with you on that . tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great . i don ' t like to take it for granted .
exactly ! you ' ll go far with that attitude !
mmm , now you ' re making me hungry for cake . what kind of cake was it ?
personally i ' m a huge fan of red velvet , but black forest is amazing too !
aw ##w , i know that can be hard , but you can ' t be too hard on yourself . sometimes you don ' t have a choice .
absence makes the heart grow fond ##er .
what are some of your best traits ?
do you exercise often ?
oh boy that is great news ! i hope you didn ' t drop a pretty penny on it ! ha ##ha , and even if you did , dogs are worth it .
hey run ##ts are the best ! they need love too . either way , i ' m glad you were paired up with the perfect companion .
i ' ve never been , but it looks like so much fun .
it would be so much fun to go there as a family .
oh yeah i am right there with you , i just don ' t even go out anymore if i can help it ! how old is yours ? mines 2 1 / 2
they are too smart for their own good
what did you see ? please don ' t tell me there was a bug in your bread
e ##w ##w ##w ##w , so nasty ! i almost ate a molded av ##oca ##do today . good thing i noticed before scoop ##ing it
or maybe she just knows you ' re a great worker and very responsible ? i hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
did you try talking to her about it ? just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
did you call the police ?
its horrible to have to got through things like that ##y
that ' s great ! i ' m so happy for you !
o ##oh , will you be managing anyone ?
i hear you ! i drop things all the time . was it one you just bought ?
u ##gh ! were you away from home ?
oh wow , she ' s doing great . i know it probably feels a bit bad that she ' s making so much more than you , but hopefully you can find away to be proud of her .
oh well that ' s great ! some people would get a little jealous . i ' m glad you ' re proud of her , i ' m sure she worked very hard for her success !
that is a good feeling !
nice ! no kids at home ?
are you afraid of the dentist ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , i ' m pretty terrified of the dentist myself . ask for gas ! good luck , i ' m sure everything will be just fine .
oh nice ! that ' s super brave of you .
that ' s a great skill to have !
that must have been a nice feeling .
i love that nos ##tal ##gic feeling .
ha ##ha , sounds like my pup ##per , is she still young ?
right ! ? it ' s weird , you buy them all the toys in the world , but they still go after your stuff .
why he is working late ?
i understand . could you plan to do something when he is late ( going out with friends ) ?
aw ##w man that sucks for you
hopefully ! it is your dream car after all
that should be fun . any big planes ?
that will be nice to catch up .
that ' s not very consider ##ate of her . was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too ? some people !
i wonder what could have changed ? either way , i ' d be pretty pissed off .
oh no ! that is terrible !
i understand . lay ##offs are hard . my brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories !
how do you feel these days ?
it must be difficult , do you think she will come back ever ?
ou ##ch ! that ' s rather painful . what are you doing now ?
wow ! that ' s like a paid vacation !
wow , that ' s incredible . what ' s their secret ?
cong ##rat ##s to your friend . i hope they share !
that ' s unfortunate , hope you don ' t get it as well !
i ' m sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time .
wow . . . that ' s kind of creepy actually . were you able to get it back ?
you ' re very lucky he was nice and didn ' t steal any of your data .
did you bring them a pan of lu ##de ##fi ##sk first ? what did they say ?
next time they let you in , just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brown ##ies .
yeah , they are cute like that . how old is she ?
i have a 10 year old like that .
that ' s amazing . watching your children succeed is so reward ##ing
that is awesome . i hope she has very much success in her gymnast ##ic end ##ev ##ours .
you are very welcome . good luck !
that ' s awful ! i hope that she didn ' t mean too !
yeah , it really sounds like she didn ' t mean to . sometimes you can find copies online if you look .
i ' m so so sorry ! we lost our chihuahua in february , so i completely understand that feeling . was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden ?
i think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves . our pup was our daughter ' s dog and she was sick prior to passing , so we knew it was coming . still doesn ' t really help though . we ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom . it ' s helped , something to think about at least .
i am sure she will be smart with it
you can always show her the ways
were they okay ?
at least you ' re not getting sued
im good at that lo ##l
don ' t worry you ' ll be fine . it ' s safe .
i ' m surprised you haven ' t started to relax a little yet .
i can only imagine . at least its nice in the day time though ?
i am not sure i would do well in that house
bet that brought back good memories .
where did you guys usually go ?
what ##s the competition on ?
nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further
i wonder how that was noted on your report .
sounds like a wa ##cky place to work .
that is awesome . congratulations . im sure you earned every penny .
good things happen to people who put in the effort . it sounds well deserved .
oh no ! do you think it ' s a wild animal ?
i hope it ' s not a crazy person or worse , an alien waiting to abd ##uc ##t you !
its so hard to monitor that stuff now
yeah , that is a scary thing to think about too
on no ! that is no good ! is he still a puppy ?
hopefully he is not doing it out of spite ! maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior .
no way ? do you have proof ? that is terrible .
wow . that is horrible . i would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police . i would be so angry .
you haven ##t met all three people in the city yet ?
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
what kind of job was it
sales do sound hard to do
is he going to be okay
i am glad then , i hate to see pets in pain
that is quite an accomplishment . someone like that is really inspiring .
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha , it ' s hard to compare yourself with that , but it really let ' s you know what ' s possible if you really want something .
why ? were they not working ?
he should have been honest from the start . it ' s on him not you .
do you think your boss will tell him it ' s you that told on him ?
that ' s so cool ! do you do a lot of climbing ?
wow , so a proper adventure then . have fun and stay safe !
ye ##a funny how that happens
well at least its being put to good use
hey cong ##rat ##s ! is it in the same field ?
hey ##y ##y ! that ' s awesome ! i wish you luck ! will it come with a sweet raise too ?
cong ##rat ##ulation . what is he planning to do next ?
good . i hope it will help her in career growth .
that ' s cool ! maybe you ' ll get along great !
lo ##l why do you have to steer clear ?
ah ##hh . i got you ! well good luck on the relocation !
that is a bad realization to come to . where did they all go ?
yeah , that is tough . once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people . maybe you could join a softball league , that ' s what i did .
it can be hard these days , money is tight
i bet that was a nice surprise
did you get it all straightened out ?
wow that is awesome , too rare in these times , count your lucky stars !
oh wonderful ! i ' m glad it went so well ! did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her ?
oh boy , i bet you were nervous . i would ' ve been too ! sounds like she ' s got a great and fun year ahead of her !
that is just gross ! have you spoken to her about it ?
i hope the ho ##a does something about that - that ' s just disgusting !
bet that was a nice calming down .
did you get up to anything else fun ?
that sounds awesome , i bet you feel proud ! its nice to do things for kids who are in need .
of course ! don ##t let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything !
oh gross , i would lose my appetite
yeah , i would probably just leave the restaurant altogether
oh my goodness , that is no fun . was it poisonous ?
they can still bite , so it ' s better safe than sorry . my father - in - law just got bitten by a black snake recently - not poisonous - but still painful .
do you have o ##cd ?
i just love when the house is clean , makes you feel good .
that ' s a bad supervisor . did you call him / her out on it ?
i hope he got in trouble !
oh most are dread ##ing going back to school . what ' s your major ?
nursing can be difficult , but if you have determination and a good support system , i ' m sure you ' ll do great !
how ' d it go ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope another opportunity comes up .
that sounds like fun ! are you big into biking ?
mountain biking is great . is is really the ##ra ##put ##ic . i hope you enjoy your new bike
that ' s horrible . what can people do to change things ?
yes ! the weapons thing is so important .
oh my go ##sh ! that is horrible ! i am so sorry to hear that .
i understand that . just give it some time and call when you are ready .
that ' s great . getting good cow ##or ##kers is so hit or miss sometimes .
that sounds like a wonderful place . i ' m kinda jealous ha ##ha ##ha .
that ' s awful ! what did you do ?
no . i mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it ?
wo ##ah that ' s really bad ! ! is it due to cost cutting ? they let you off .
it happens ! ! i hope you will find a better job with a better company ! !
oh no , that ' s the worst .
i hope you can get it back somehow !
that is an amazing accomplishment . what field are you in ?
i ' m sure you know that she is so proud of you ! that is really incredible ! congratulations !
that is so romantic . they weren ' t for any occasion ?
were they your favorites ?
oh yu ##ck . did you get a chance to return it to the store ?
that ' s crazy ! i ' d leave it on the counter at the store . hopefully you aren ' t out much money .
wow that must have been amazing !
they ' re going to remember that forever
dan ##g , that sucks . did you ever catch the cu ##lp ##rit ?
yeah , that guy sounds like a jerk . did your insurance cover the dent ?
oh wow ! my dog jr died of old age too .
oh , did something happen to him ?
i am sorry to hear that . mine died of old age as well last month .
me neither , but in the end , i really didn ' t think about him as a dog , he was just my buddy . i hope fond memories of him get you through this .
that can be so ag ##gra ##vating . did the company make it up to you for being so late ?
at least they made up for it . if they had not i wouldn ' t use them again .
i know the feeling . what team is he root ##ing for ?
i don ' t even know what team that is , ha ##ha . football is lost on me .
oh that ' s good , last time my computer broke was a day before i left the country
i took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 min ##s , just needed a hardware reset
oh my goodness , is he with the armed forces ?
i cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier . while i can ' t bring him home quicker , i do want to say thank you to you , him and your family for your sacrifice .
that is horrible , did anyone get hurt ?
hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay .
that is scary . what was it ?
go ##sh it ' s worse than i thought it would be . what did you do ?
sorry to hear that . what happened on the test ?
hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more !
he must be very smart
it paid off . wish i was smart like that
oh no . how old are you ?
is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
i hope things are better next time .
that ' s great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships !
lo ##l ! oh gee ##z - so many take years to get it u ##gh ! but at least he finally has ! i hope he is very romantic too !
cong ##rat ##s < 3
not yours ? that is so weird , usually they are on their way out not in ! lo ##l
did you eventually get it out ? i would have been flipping bon ##kers !
that sounds terrifying ! im glad you have a basement though , it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in !
oh your right , i have an almost 3 year old and i wouldn ' t know how to explain it as well ! that is so hard sometimes because you don ' t know what to say !
oh my goodness , are you alright ? i bet you created a mess !
i hope you can laugh a little about it now !
that sounds like a great gift . that is going to be a great time .
wow . i am sure you will remember this for a long time . you are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now .
i ' m sorry to hear about that . it sounds like , to me , that he lived a long life with you though , and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him . i ' m worried for my girlfriend and what she ' ll do when that happens to her and her dog
that ' s crazy , and a little heart - breaking too . i ' m en ##vious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had . i have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet . i hope i do at some point
that ' s so sad . . . did you have a lot of good memories in that house ?
i ' m so sorry : ( at least you have your memories to look back on .
that was really nice of him . i know that she had to be relieved .
someone was watching over her .
how long had you been married ?
hmm . that ' s a bit of a strange story .
i hate to hear that . i hate tickets . there are so many other things i would rather spend my money on .
yeah , that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for .
cool , what are you getting ?
that ' s a nice car , you are going to enjoy it .
neat ! we took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago ! did ya ' ll build a fire ?
that ' s defiant ##ly a priority ! i hope you brought everything that you need . forgetting something can be a pain
the 1 - 6 times as in multiplication ? teaching children is so reward ##ing .
i bet she was super excited to get it all down .
what grade is she in ?
what kind of school was she at before ?
where did you go ?
we went there a few years back . had a great time .
awesome news ! what was the response ?
oh . not so good news then : ( i ' m sorry . i ' m sure you ' ll find something !
that ' s awesome , i bet you were over ##joy ##ed with it !
you never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you , that ' s true !
oh no ! do you have any way of finding out who did it ?
yeah , thieves are terrible . i mean , who would steal a mo ##wer ?
what did you do ?
ye ##a i can see that , it happens but it sucks
well at ##lea ##st you watch them with him ! i don ##t like them either .
oh no , no thank you ! lo ##l ah ##hh i can ##t even .
that ' ll be tough . do you have anything you can do to keep busy ?
i bet . it ' s sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house .
spray water over there
that ##s good , you should
could you get with your hr department to see if they can assist ?
what would you do to them ?
ye ##a , i used to hate it too .
like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear ?
is it really hard ? or you just have not have that much time to pal ##y
yeah some people are just natural ##y good at video games
that ' s pretty impressive , does he have any training or just all self taught ?
well it ' s certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that !
that is frustrating ! we have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs . so annoying all day !
i am sure he thinks it ' s his world , the rules don ##t apply to him . sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude
well you must be happy about it .
oh ! that is bad then . be careful .
i hope you hear good news .
i understand . i guess you ' ll always feel that way .
it was nice of you to buy him food , but i ' m thinking he didn ' t pay you back .
i ' m sorry . i know it sucks to need money and be counting on it , and then you don ' t get it . i hope he pays you back soon .
u ##gh ! i use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would po ##op in my driveway ! at least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise .
does this happen often ? i ' d let my neighbor know about it .
that ' s great ! you must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them .
i bet you had tons of catching up to do !
the way you wrote that makes it seem like you ' re anticipating something bad . . . do you mind if i ask what you ' re expecting to happen ?
interesting . . . well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead . if you ' re not sure what it could be , then at least it ' s not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part . i hope for the best for you
that is unfortunate , my own mother was ill for several years , she is getting older as well . do you get to see her often ?
just spend what time you can with her , i ' d like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks . sorry you are having to deal with it .
that was great of him !
he sounds very nice !
oh really what was the assignment
it ' s always great to get back positive feedback !
what was it like when it showed up on your door ?
that ##s hilarious , you finally got it though uh ##uh ?
im sure they had a good excuse .
oh i see . hopefully its just that one time where he couldn ##t get to his phone to let you know .
oh crap ! how long until ##l you realized ?
that ##s so good , man i have done that a time of two .
i am sure you will as well . confidence is great !
congratulations . you have done great !
that ' s really cool . what kind of car ?
that sounds like a really awesome car !
aw ##w , that ' s really sweet and sentimental . i like that . can you still read the words on it ?
i was going to say , yeah , that ' s the kind of thing i would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office . how cool !
who did you go see ? and are you still friends with all the same people ? i wonder if any of them kept their ticket stu ##bs too .
that stink ##s . what did you do ?
and did you find one ?
oh that is awesome . and you got a fancy pen out of it
did it went well ?
that is great . what was the issue with your ear ?
you made quick work out of that
i wish i could un ##load that fast
oh goodness . that has happened to me before . i could not sleep
how in the world did it get in your house ? were you able to kill it ?
o ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##o nice !
well you two have fun tonight . i won ' t tell your parents about all this .
why you need to thank her ? is she the one that helped you to find the new job ?
she is very nice person . that is great .
oh . will he be starting elementary school ?
aw he ' s at that precious age where you have to let his hand go , hu ?
damn why ' d you have to tell me that . . . ga ##wd that ' s freak ##in sad , je ##ez ##us
i wish you and your fa ##m peace happiness love and good health .
what ? do you have evidence supporting this
good hope that bitch goes to hell . . . sorry i love animals and my mom ' s dog died the same way
that is a big deal . what are you going to do ?
i would throw trash in their yard .
he sounds like a real hero though . i hope he comes home safe soon
i can only imagine . at least you have each other
are you and your family okay ?
i am sorry , you can replace it though
wow ! how kind is that ! their really are kind people left in this world . how did you respond ?
* there * o ##ops . did you ever find out her name ? or find out a way to thank her ?
on no ! did you have to walk , or did you call for service ?
wow , you got lucky ! did you give him a tip ?
why did you feel you had to cheat ? i am sure you could have passed if you had studied .
well , don ' t let this one situation define you . use it as a learning experience and move on , and do you best not to repeat it .
that ' s so sad ! what on earth happened ?
now that is quite embarrassing ! what did your co - workers say ?
that is wonderful ! she must be so proud of herself and i know you are proud of her . its great that she likes learning so much .
aw ##w ##w , what a great idea ! that ' s so cute ! where are you guys going ?
you are such a good person to do that !
it ' s crazy how the tables turn !
why do you say that
oh no , were you okay
oh my goodness , what happened ? did they find out you owe money to the local crime families ? those bank employees need to mind their own business , am i right ! ?
that is absolutely unacceptable . s ##ni ##tch ##es get stitches , that ' s what i say . tell me where they ' re at and i ' ll roll up on ' em and tell ' em what for . just say the word . i ' ve got your back .
have you asked your friends for family ?
i would def feel that way . its hard when you don ##t know the person or can trust them
oh yeah ? and what news might that be ?
nice ! did he sign up to be a water ##boy ?
oh my goodness , that ' s terrible !
what do you plan on doing ?
uh oh . did something happen ?
that must be trauma ##ti ##zing . most people wouldn ' t want to go out alone after that . it ' s understand ##able .
do you think you will get the job ?
i hope you end up getting it !
oh definitely , youtube is a great platform for these talented people
yeah , my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens
do you think there something wrong
oh no that ##s terrible im sorry to hear that
me too ! i bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night !
you and i both ! no matter who wins , let ' s promise to split the pot .
oh nice , where are you going ?
wow , i ' ve never been on a cruise before . i think it sounds like a lot of fun
why ? what did she do ?
she is a special woman .
i would be down ##right furious . start by smack ##ing him across the face randomly at dinner . that should be a good se ##g ##way into the conversation .
oh , he certainly will when he feels the hot , guilty tears running down his face from that strong , independent , jealous filled slap !
was any of your stuff damaged ?
oh wow ! i am sorry to hear that . maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill mob ##y dick to make up for the damages .
exciting ! are you moving to a new company ?
oh fun ! i ' m so excited for you . try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities !
oh gee ##z ! what on earth was it !
that is fr ##ig ##gin revolt ##ing ! ! ! i would have lost my lunch right then and there !
no way . what happened ? if honestly , almost all my days are like this . so , worst has become normal for me
don ' t get it personally . good performance will always catch other ' s attention . just continue doing your work
that ' s awesome ! always good to be content with life .
it ' s good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen .
def ##inate ##ly ! i have one daughter and twins on the way . . . i fore ##see love over ##load . how many do you have ?
thanks , mother ##hood truly is amazing
not really , do you ?
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that , i hope it picks up for you , maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits
o ##of , sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do i guess
well you tried to make things right , you ' re still a good person
i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me . are you ?
im glad to hear that !
what are you packing extra clothes for ? did you go somewhere did something happen ?
what are you packing extra clothes for ? did you go somewhere did something happen ?
what concert is it ? are you excited to go ?
oh my god , i ' m so jealous , she isn ' t coming to my city this time . you ' re gonna have a great time
wow , that will be a busy house
that ' s a great attitude , i hope you and your family stay happy and healthy
what did you lie about , are you going to tell him ?
ha ##ha ##ha if anything that is ex ##cus ##able , noon ##e like in ##law ##s !
how scary ! i ' m terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
well i hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe !
wow , that ' s very nice of him ! was there a lot of people there ?
that ' s too bad . i hope you had a blast !
that ' s a good idea ! it ' s always smart to be on the safe side .
i ' ve done that as well where nothing ends up happening but i bought all this stuff . you never know what could happen though .
where are you going on vacation ?
that should be fun , what do you plan to do there ?
that must of been horrible .
i am sure people forgot already .
what job is it ?
only one way to find out .
what branch of the military then ?
the marines is by far my favorite so good for him !
oh no that ' s horrible . have you complained to the electric company ?
i would too at this point . it might be more reliable .
that will be no fun .
don ' t you have to be selected first ?
that sucks ! i hate losing money as well .
that ' s how i always feel at those things as well !
i do enjoy the zoo and the animals . i think they could be just as good .
i think it ' s a good outlook .
hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own .
it ' s a tough choice to make , and not everyone has to raise a child .
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isn ##t . but not sure about the ready for anything
almost ? so the situation resolved itself ?
what kind of interview ?
really ? that is cool
how exactly ?
i bet you needed help to take all the presents back home .
oh my god , how did you get out of there ?
that sounds great .
that ' s a great asset to have emotionally i think .
yeah it might just be something you ' re born with .
i agree . music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day .
hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune .
how did that go ? did it bring back a lot of memories ?
im glad to hear that . sounds like a great trip
almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in georgia . i don ' t mind the rain as long as i ' m inside . the sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up . do you prefer sunny days ?
i have to be very careful in the sun . my all ##er ##gies and the sun don ' t mix too well . i can tolerate the rain much better . i love the sound of water .
i can agree with that . i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
def . make the best of them
it ' s good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own .
hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way .
i once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road . it ' s amazing how much people litter
i wish . people might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people ' s trash as well .
are you in a dangerous place ?
i suppose so . it ' s great that you value life so much !
oh no . did it get ruined ?
close call . i once sp ##il ##t tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
really ? so sorry for the lose
was she sick ?
that ' s a bum ##mer . it ' s never fun to not win .
hopefully you ' ll have better luck next time !
that ' s not good , we ended up lucky with who we have
maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company . have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok ?
that ' s wonderful ! i hope you will get that promotion ! what do you do ?
good luck ! whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate
i agree , plus i love making snow ##men !
i always get sad though when they melt
ou ##ch ! did they try to help you back up ?
of course ! well , at least you also looked human . we all make mistakes .
that sounds really scary ! is your son afraid or is he use to it ?
i would hate that as well . i hope he learns to cope with it .
that is a lot of extra money to sp ##en , but it is completely understand ##able it you are that nervous about it . have you ever looked into calming medications , or meditation to help your nerves ?
i completely understand that . my mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying , but she did h ##yp ##nosis and it really helped .
wow . that ' s intense . did your home get any damage ?
yeah . i feel for you . it hurts to lose things like that .
that is awesome . happy birthday ! what kind is it ?
is that a gaming computer ?
sorry to hear about that . are the damages covered by an insurance ?
i understand . it is always difficult to start from ground zero . good luck .
interesting . . . . did you do it
lo ##l why would he get mad . . . but did you have fun in the end
why do you cheat on him ?
oh i see , why are you still with him then ?
i know how you feel . are you also spoiled by amazon ##e prime ?
ha ##ha , i know . especially when i purchase firearms related things like ammunition . it has to ship ground . 1 week for shipping ? ! ? ! rage .
yeah , the us is huge , land ##mas ##s wise .
you can always leave them an angry review online
what did your dog do ?
oh no , well at least he didn ##t hurt the rabbit .
what happened to you ?
that sucks sorry to hear . are you okay ?
oh nice ! i bet you ' ll remember that for a long time
i ' ve never been to a concert . i should go see one like you !
that ' s terrible ! how does that make you feel ?
that is the reality of life , unfortunately ! that ' s what you have to enjoy life now .
that is terrible . how long have you had this pet ?
honesty is ve ##y important . i hope she will not feel too bad .
where are you going ?
that is going to be so fun !
i am never ready . which diet are you trying
i think my favorite and easiest would have to be atkins but still al ##ot of prep to get started
your welcome , and i will check out ke ##to .
my kit ##ties are my family too . animals are the best .
exactly ! i am glad you have them
that sounds interesting . . what was it ? and how did you find out ? and why did he hide it ! if you don ' t mind me asking , of course . . .
oh i see . . well that ' s a pretty positive talent then , huh ? maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it . maybe he misses it . you could get him a present for his birthday or christmas that was related to drawing tools / pencil ##s and all that .
how is that working out for you
practice makes perfect
om ##g i would be upset too . . . how many times have you called them to fix it ?
sounds like a nightmare ! total .
does it make you feel happy about your life since then ?
well at least you ' ll always have your memories as time goes on .
that ' s why i don ' t watch sports lo ##l we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard redskins fan
lo ##l no ! you shouldn ' t ! that ' s the best part ! talking smack to each other
oh i know how you feel ! i wish there was some kind of hot ##line where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
that ##s awful ! people should be arrested for that
oh no ! devastating ! i ' m so sorry .
that makes me feel ill so i ' m sure you were sick . i hope somehow you make it up !
that could turn out expensive . did they need a particular brand for a particular reason ?
that ' s annoying , maybe they should provide links for you next time ?
how did it go ?
that is great . interviews are very intimidating .
oh no , what happened ?
there has o be an easier way . i have always avoided baby ##sit ##ting because i just don ' t like other peoples kids that much .
so i am guessing she gave you a good surprise ?
she ' s must be a keeper then .
that is awesome . i have never won anything in my life . what festival was it ?
congratulations ! did you have a good time ?
wow that ##s awesome . how did you win them ? i never win anything cool .
aw ##w that stink ##s , i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money
that is crazy ! how is he still employed ?
that makes people look bad . i have severe anxiety and still go to work . i get that things are hard but . . . . its bad to never come in .
i am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings . its not healthy to self harm and pen ##t up your feelings .
that ##s what best friends are for , after all . i hope things have gotten better for you .
ge ##sh , that ' s frustrating . i had a dog that used to do that too . had to get a trash can with a lid .
we even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it . hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out .
that is awe inspiring , very patriotic . did you get pictures ?
i ' m sure , that isn ' t something you see every day , or would even expect to see ever . i ' m glad you got it documented .
well , that ' s great . but you probably should study as well . school is very important .
yeah , that does sound like a conflicting situation . well at least you ' re doing something positive .
i bought a lit ##e brit ##e from goodwill about a year ago . it was one of the remake ##s from recent years but we had fun with it .
nope , they only know how to touch screens .
that ' s great ! how long have you two been together ?
you learn a lot about someone when you move in with them , so if you feel comfortable in your relationship i think that ' s actually rather pr ##ude ##nt .
oh i ' ll bet that didn ' t smell pleasant .
oh gross . i hope she won ' t do that again .
moving is the worst . all those boxes . u ##gh . i hope i don ##t have to do it for awhile
i hope its good that she moved in with you . things must be serious
that sounds pretty amazing , what convention was it ?
i ' m so happy for you , it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity !
that is always so much fun . which ones made you feel the most nos ##tal ##gic ?
i know how you feel . i feel guilty about ind ##ul ##ging in ice cream the older i get .
oh ye ##a ? and what did they get you ?
oh nice . those are fun . i love playing video games
oh yes ? what happened ?
oh , that must have been so precious ! we had deer around where i used to live - they ' re gorgeous creatures .
that ' s not much fun . did he get a new one recently ?
wow , you ' re smart and kind ! i wouldn ' t know where to start re . building a computer . well done !
what a nice thing to do . you seem to get on very well with your little bro .
i love my brother , too . he ' s a great guy . how lucky we are !
do you know it was her for sure ? that is horrible that you can ##t trust your own sister .
that is horrible . it sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family . i would be so mad .
i hear you ! that sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it ' s stuff you miss !
that ##s great ! what kind of stuff was in the dreams ?
that has got to be one of the best feelings . i love being complimented .
you should be proud of yourself . keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off .
don ##t put too much weight into those advertisements . sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you .
i know that feeling . sometimes they can really get under your skin .
that ##s nice to hear . hopefully it makes you two happy . i would just un ##pack the nec ##ess ##ities first and move from there .
sounds like a plan ! make sure to hydra ##te properly because un ##pack ##ing is cum ##bers ##ome work !
that would be a great feeling . did something happen to make you feel more content ?
that ##s so awesome ! cong ##rat ##s ! i am hoping to get there soon . i have a lot to be thankful for but i know i need to work on just a little bit before i am fully content .
oh nice ! i know that feeling , is it home ? what made you think about going there ?
nice ! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it !
yeah it can be ak ##ward some times specially if you don ##t know what to talk about
yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation ?
well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction
do you think they deserved it ?
well as they say , " better them than you "
that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
that is good hard work and determination will always pay off
that ##s a really good feeling isn ##t it ? anything in particular ?
that ##s awesome . im glad your ##e happy . keep the positive energy flowing
im guessing it wasn ##t your fault ? do you know who ##s it was ?
that sounds like sabotage to me . is there any way to prove you weren ##t there ? i would be furious .
did they not ever come ?
man that ' s a bum ##mer . i ' d visit you but that would be weird .
that is awesome . what kind of designs are there ?
that is very very cool . i would love something like that in mine
its always nice getting praise and compliment ##s . i hope everyone was proud of you
that ##s great . i hope you get a raise too
like what ?
wow that ' s really compassionate of you
are you feeling much more motivated now ? what do you want to achieve ?
that ##s such fantastic goals to aim for in life ! i wish you all the best .
happy birthday . that was so nice of them . i bet you were surprised . was there cake ?
ha ##ha that sounds quite messy , but i hope that it at ##lea ##st tasted good
i agree , you need money for everything these days and it controls us .
me too , i try not to worry about money so much . there ' s more to life than that .
i hope your work continues on the path you want and expect .
hard work is supposed to pay ##off , right ?
i know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast . do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep .
if you get sick you won ' t be able to work at all so please take care of yourself .
what happened ?
wow , that ' s cruel .
yeah that is a pretty good minds ##et to go by .
just keep it up and you will go far .
that is great ! i ' m also learning to write code .
html / cs ##s / java . i ' m excited about a career change .
why is that ?
oh god yes i know what you mean , any ideas what you wanna do ?
uh ##oh , did you get lost ?
oh that is scary . i hope you were ok . make sure your doors are locked
what was wrong with it
good luck ! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday . . $ 12 . 5 ##k to replace
well music does have a really cat ##hart ##ic effect on people .
he can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure
wow ! that ' s a horrible prank ! i would be crying ! what did you do when your friend gave it back ?
i would have been really mad as well ! hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again !
i ' m sorry to hear that . do you mind if i ask what happened today to make it so weird ?
oh , i see . i think i kind of understand . it at least sounds like you ' re a really self - aware person , and app ##re ##cia ##tive of the small things , and that you have decent perspective on things . the emotions might be difficult to deal with , but at least there are some positive ##s there for you to take stock of
that ##s crazy . and scary . what happened ?
im so sorry . i hope your ##e ok
getting paid is always a good thing . were you waiting to get something special ?
you deserve one . did you get it ?
i hate it when that happens ! were they driving fast at the time , it could have been quite dangerous .
i can imagine , at least you got out of the situation safely
that ' s awesome . i think it ' s great that you stepped up to repay your loans !
oh man , well i hope that it was worth it to take out those loans .
that is such a long time to live in loneliness . i suggest you do , dogs are great companions
sounds like a great idea ! that would be very nice of you to give a dog a home
wow , congratulations ! ! are you guys excited ?
i know the feeling ! my son is a year old so i remember it well ha ##ha .
you get a new trim ?
that ' s awesome , bet you look straight out of 1990s .
what did you guys get up to ?
what do you miss the most ?
that is awesome . what did he make you ?
that sounds yu ##mmy . i ' m glad you had that special treat .
do you know what kind of dog ?
those things can really fly on the ground .
oh no ! i bet she was mad as heck
oh hey ! if it works out for you have fun
gross ! out of all the bugs that i find in my house , those would be the worse .
knowing roach ##es , they ' d probably survive it , seeing as they can pretty much survive anything !
oh no ! did he pass ?
that ' s great ! ! hopefully he will do good in school this year and not have to go to summer school again !
that ' s great . maybe a promotion or a raise in on the horizon ?
well i hope that it goes well for you !
nice ! i hope you get this job if you worked hard for it
just have faith in your abilities and the rest will come by itself
i ' m sure its always fun to view the progress of your creations .
that sounds nice , having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun .
oh ye ##a . . what ##s happened since then
oh well that sounds pleasant
did it feel good to get back out ?
how far did you end up running tonight ?
how did you do ?
oh wow ! cong ##rat ##s ! that ' s great !
it is it ' s something we all have as humans it ' s not defined by gender show off your emotions proud .
it really is why would someone make you feel like it was for girls only especially being young but you are great now .
he should be ashamed for himself , did he say why he did it ?
well , on the other hand you can think of this situation , as if you just paid $ 500 to a person to never bother you again .
have you hugged him recently ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , he is a brave man .
did something ruin it ?
well that ##s not too bad
i can ' t think of a certain moment that the idea clicked . it seems like i ' ve always known they can .
what was that moment for you ?
im sorry but i am laughing . i bet you were so embarrassed .
i would imagine . just own it and wear it like a badge .
its nice to have the internet
i cannot even imagine
sounds very relaxing to me , as long as my all ##er ##gies don ' t act up .
i always keep some prop ##olis pills with me just in case .
what happened that made you have to do that ?
oh goodness ! are you ok ?
i enjoy sunny weather too .
they must enjoy the rain .
oh no , i ' m sorry hu ##n . i hope you ' re at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities .
well there is at least one positive . maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acc ##lim ##ate .
i do almost everyday i feel like that is a great minds ##et to have to make your day successful .
they are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling .
i agree , do you have a favorite artist ?
yes , he is great no wonder his work is so expensive .
that ' s good . did you find out the results of the test ?
good luck on the exam !
what does providence mean ?
okay , tell me more about that .
that ' s great . does he do photography as a job or a hobby ?
maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money !
that sounds wonderful ! i ' ve never been on a cruise , i bet you are excited and ready to go !
i know that feeling all too well . too much to do and not enough time to do it all , and certain things you can ' t do until the week of . hopefully you will get it all done and then you guys will have a great time !
wow what kind of dog did you lose ?
that ' s so tragic i have 3 dogs myself , do you have flyers up ?
o ##of , i hope that doesn ' t wake you up
maybe it doesn ' t fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn ' t have any other way of expressing itself
that ' s cool . do you celebrate both of them on the same day ?
ha ##ha i bet . that ' s pretty awesome !
oh no . did something bad happen ?
that ; s great . i have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood .
she is going to be great at that job
oh no . how ' d they react ?
i ' d be super em ##bara ##ssed , too !
wow , that ' s horrible , i hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone
yi ##kes , i would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family , let him understand it ' s not okay
i remember those
i never had one . i didn ##t know they were expensive
that ' s great ! i hope you keep getting good reviews like that .
that ' s awesome . how much do you anti ##cp ##ate the raise to be ?
oh that ##s cool , is she good ?
oh that ##s cool
oh that sounds like it will be very reward ##ing !
a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt !
oh god . the living room is shared . she should just leave the mess ##iness in her room .
how old is she ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . how old is the cat ?
all you can do is make sure she ' s not in too much pain as she goes .
i hope you walked out right then and there !
ah that was really di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful of her though . that ' s not someone you ' d want to date long term .
that is good to hear . she should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then .
that should bo ##de well for her and her future there though , so it was a good surprise !
how has it been going ?
that is good , hopefully you find your soul ##mate .
oh god . did anything happen ?
well , i hope nothing bad happened !
i watched it too ! my favorite is federer . who is yours ?
i have for the past 10 years ! it ' s one of my favorite sports to watch .
that ' s great . do you th ##ii ##nk you will get a raise ?
confidence is super important
good luck . even though you don ' t need it
that ' s great ! you must be happy !
how come he came home early ?
that ' s really thoughtful of you . do you typically do things like that ?
perhaps i should find the local shelter in my community and do the same . i have never done that before and i feel like i should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity .
ya ##y ! do you guys have free time to spend together now ?
that sounds great , you should make him dinner to surprise him back !
how long did that last for ?
why didn ' t you tell them to move ?
you must really miss them .
ye ##a . seeing each other on a screen definitely can ' t beat being with each other in person .
did he catch you doing something crazy ?
that ##s good lo ##l
that ' s so sad . do you have any other friends there ?
i am so sorry for you . perhaps you can hang with her after your work ##day ##s ?
new york is a fun place to visit .
you will have a blast .
oh no ! was it too short for your liking ?
yi ##kes ! i would ask for a ref ##und for sure
wow ! well a cheat day here and there might be okay ! ha ##ha
right , but i ' d say once isn ' t too bad as long you stay on track .
i would feel terrible too . where did you move to ?
i ' ve moved almost half a dozen times in my life before , so i completely understand . those were rough times .
that sucks , imagine being in an environment like that all day , i would go crazy
i guess some people are just really rude , no matter what position you put them in
it ' s hard to trust a gps . i have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way . please tell me you didn ' t do it .
i am so glad that it didn ' t turn out bad for you .
what did he do , how did he react ?
well he is the one missing out and i ' m sure your very worthy of attention from some better .
why was she upset ? depending on how many people entered , fifth could be really good .
that ' s still really good ! she did better than 25 other people .
nice ! i bet you can ##t wait ! do you anti ##ci ##pate to re ##lea ##x or do things to catch up ?
very nice ! i bet its going to be a good happy weekend .
dan ##g , and here i thought i was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest . maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big ?
why stop at 50 ? we ought to get 100 ! we need to show your friend and evil corporate ta ##co bell who is boss and na ##b us some consoles !
did you let him ?
you are good to allow him to borrow the car .
wow , i really like to do that . i hope you will enjoy it . .
ah ok . if you try once you will be alright next time . .
that sounds revolt ##ing ! have you said anything to him about it ?
that sounds like a good plan . perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommate ##s for your future ab ##ode .
did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her ?
that was very rude of her to do that , some people just have no manners .
that ' s so exciting ! have you run a marathon before ?
that ' s good , i hope you do well ! how did you prepare ?
what a nice surprise ! did something happen or did he miss you ! ?
i see . i bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together .
i ' m sorry to hear . why is that ?
oh , well that is a fine thing indeed ! i would be jumping up and down !
sounds pretty lonely . did you meet or make some friends while out of town ?
ah i see . staying focused is hard , especially when your lonely .
that ' s horrible ! is she going to try again ?
it must have been awful to see that in someone you care about . i ' m glad she ' s not giving up .
wow , that ##s great . you must be loving it
you must get a good sleep now to enjoy the new york later
nice ! were they scratch offs ?
i will cross mine too ! i hope ya ' ll win it big .
om ##g . . . . that had to be so scary .
i am so glad that you are . now no more driving when your sleepy .
that really sucks . maybe you should try egg ##ing their door ? or just break in and pretend you ' re big ##foot while they ' re trying to sleep .
i would go with the big ##foot option . you can get a costume on the cheap on e ##bay nowadays . i ' ve used that tactic countless times and it has never failed !
that is some exciting news . do you already know what kind of vehicle you want ?
christmas is coming early . you will have to take me for a ride .
i am sure you will . good luck for you ! !
what ##s kind of exam is that ?
don ' t be . i think you will ace it .
exam ' s are always scary . we just need to take the mind out of it
why not block the calls ?
have you asked them to stop calling about this topic ?
have you spoken to him ?
maybe you should buy some ear ##pl ##ug ##s .
i love tennis . will you watch the us open ?
it is a great tournament , you should watch .
so are they telling you good news ?
oh okay . well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do .
o ##oh how nice ! do you have any guess ##es as to what she may be making you ?
well i hope it ' s good ! your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that .
you are so lucky to find someone special online . that can turn out so badly sometimes for some people .
that sounds like fate ? being that both of you lived close to each other .
wow , watching kids grow up is hard . how has she been with the cell phone ?
that ' s great parenting ! you have to trust that your children will make the right choices .
i am sure with your guidance she will !
you should go , otherwise the condition could get worse .
that is great news ! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i ' m glad they have helped you !
oh my goodness that sounds so bad ! did they charge you for the visit ?
you made the right move . they at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry .
if i had a bag of m & m ' s right now i would eat them for sure !
maybe save the other half for later . lo ##l .
that ' s ok , it happens to us all . tomorrow is a new day .
how did she reacted to the admission to self harm ?
now that your girlfriend knows the problem , the both of you can work on solutions and support together .
is that like a laser tag place ? that sounds like a lot of fun ! what do you think ?
i ' ve played laser tag a few times . i think you will have a great time ! it ' s very high paced and noisy but that ' s half the fun .
oh that sounds wo ##rri ##some , do you think you will pass ?
i ' m sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight . honestly , if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them .
that sounds intensive ! how did it go ?
i bet that was so defeating ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts .
that ' s a good bright side to look at .
did you save it or kill it ?
it ' s missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately .
o ##oh , i bet you can ' t wait to finish !
i hope you get it ! good luck !
how did they go ? did you pass ?
wow ! cong ##rat ##s , you should totally be proud of yourself .
that ' s very sweet ! i bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you .
you guys sound like you have a solid relationship . it ' s always great to find those little pieces from the early days .
did you get her number ?
good man , i have a lot of respect for that .
that sounds like quite the check ##list . i ' m glad you brought the beer you might need it ha ##ha !
well i bet you ' re going to have a great time . with that haul i don ' t see how you couldn ' t !
holy cow ! did you call him in ?
oh man ! do you have a dog ?
how come ? and was it a pain to replace it ?
i hope he did a good job !
awesome , i ' m glad to hear that . sometimes it ' s hard to find contractors with good reputation .
how come you didn ' t collect them ? i loved them myself .
well , they are expensive and you didn ' t really miss much .
nice , was it hard to start ?
wish i could run close to 5 ##km , i ' d struggle with 100 meters .
that ' s cool . man , those tiny disks were easy to lose . what game ?
that ' s awesome . i get nos ##tal ##gic about old games as well .
that sounds horrible , did you wash it or throw it away ?
that is a really rough story , you should make him pay for another one .
damn , is he ok now ?
did he go to the doctors for help ? anyway i ' m glad he is ok .
oh no ! was it a fun night ?
oh heck ! that had to be really scary for them ! glad you ' re okay though !
aw ##w , that sounds interesting ! are you in touch with many people from high school ?
i get that . it ' s weird when i forget the name of someone i knew for years .
poor thing ! is he fell ##ing better now ? i hope he quit that diet .
thank god he is ok . there are very dangerous diet ##s around , better be guided by his doctor .
were you nervous ?
that ' s awesome . i ' m glad he did so well .
that ' s lovely ! i love waking up to awesome texts .
that ' s so wonderful to hear .
how did that make you feel ?
i bet . i ' m not great at being away from my boyfriend .
that ' s great ! what have you been doing to social ##ize ?
what kind of convention ?
that ' s such a sweet thing to do .
dogs are probably my favorite pet . maybe i should take up volunteer ##ing for a dog shelter one day .
lil pee ##p died ? when .
damn , him and xx ##xt ##ent ##acion we ' re really good .
i love pup ##pies ! but they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair .
i understand . our puppy sheds a ton too and he isn ##t even that hairy of a dog
oh my , that sounds like an absolute blast !
did you stay for long ? that would be a great vacation .
what a great time ! is the cottage on a lake ?
sounds like heaven !
oh no ! did you get in trouble ?
aw ##w , i ' m sorry . hope that teacher learned a lesson
it ' s wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies ! did you have a nice trip ?
aw , that was so nice ! i ' d love to find a cat sit ##ter like that !
how did it go ? what ' d you get him for a gift ?
it seems like all those years just flew by , huh . at least now he ' s getting old enough to start remembering all these great times !
are you feeling za ##pped from the week ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you don ' t have to work through the weekend !
it never ends does it ? i hope you keep your head above water though , it ' s all you got sometimes !
i feel that pain . do you not have the motivation or just don ##t know what to do ?
i get that . well if i could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything . don ##t worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage .
sure . i love working out .
how much pain are you on a scale of 1 - 10 ?
dan ##g that sounds bad ! i know you might be frightened of going but i think you should go . you ' ll be better off for it .
that was nice of them ! i bet you felt really cool hanging with them . how did it go ?
that is awesome ! i love festivals , they ' re always great to un ##wind and even just walk around talking to people .
why not , have you have many temptation ##s ? i know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy , i struggle to do it too .
i know , fresh bread is a big temptation to me , and what about sweets and dessert ##s , do you have a weakness for those too ?
i like domino ##s better
domino ##es , im ##o , has better prices and better pizza . i don ##t like all that oil
that ' s thoughtful of her . nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day .
take her out to dinner ! that would be a treat .
oh no ! you must ' ve felt ashamed . did you return it ?
hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental ?
did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their .
its always best to be on time , i hope they understand no one is perfect .
the journey there is always the tough ##est , its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it
with whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person ! im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time
wow , that was serious then
ok , so what is your plan now ?
wow that sounds scary . did you make good friends ?
yes it can be really helpful ! i went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
oh , that must have been a hard thing to do . i ' d hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news . . .
so sad . . . that makes me want to cry , too , just hearing about her reaction .
i bet it does ! do you go by there often ?
i bet it ' s much different than it was back when you lived there .
oh no : ( can you tell me ? it ' s okay if it ' s too private .
oh my go ##sh i ' m so sorry that really sucks . : ( can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong ?
good luck to you ! i wish you all the best < 3
oh no why would they do such a thing
definitely doesn ' t excuse what they did .
that ' s not cool . i bet it felt awkward .
you are a stand up person !
nice , silence is golden
full of what ?
oh no , was it one of those meetings that should have been an email ?
hopefully you don ' t get in trouble but i definitely know the feeling .
oh really , were you supposed to tell them ?
you can never be to sure now a days , they might post your secret to social media .
did you ace your test ?
i always worry when i have to take tests . unfortunately , i am horrible with tests . i am glad you ace ##d it !
nice , what a legend and a gentleman
word , you should ask him what the secret is
that kind of cold disregard for someone you ' re supposed to love is totally alien to me , the guilt would destroy me .
yeah freud called it projection , it ' s too bad people tend to hide their true nature ##s so well .
it ' s awful ! i know so many families are dealing with similar situation . sometimes we don ' t know how to help someone close to us . heart breaking . . .
you can ' t help him until he wants to really change . sometimes all you can do is pray .
did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done ?
it ' s good to get to spend time with those you love . i am happy for you .
that ' s inspiring , has that worked for you in the past in the same way ?
that ' s so cool , you seem very intuitive
that sounds frightening . did you get home safely ?
why were you walking so late at night ?
nice , what are some things you realized ?
you don ' t have me yet < 3
oh god , how did you . have the courage to even go outside ?
that sounds like an adventurous day
wow , how could they do that ?
someone ' s gotta put an end to that poor service !
you should . no matter what you can ' t lie to your mom . it will always come back on you .
come clean and fix it . it will make you feel better .
nice ! do you have any super ##power ##s ?
i like your confidence ! fighting !
oh nice , what kind of memories ?
how does this make you feel like ?
that ' s awesome ! you ' re going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
that ' s exciting . how long have you been learning programming ?
an interesting one , what does this make you feel ?
oh did he say anything afterwards ? what happen ##d next ?
that is so kind of you , i also a have a soft heart for animals . i happen to be a dog person , but i do have a cat that was my ex boyfriend ##s .
i can ' t say i have had any mean dogs as of yet . my favorite breed is a pit ##bu ##ll . they are so loyal and sweet although lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .
where are you going !
that ##s awesome i hope you have a good time with her
wow , that must ' ve been disappointing .
oh ! so close . just to think about that missed opportunity .
yeah , it ' s like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same
yu ##p , and i feel there ' s a part of us that is eternal as well
i think i would leave if i saw something like that .
did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it ?
it seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it .
i feel that way sometimes when i check my bank account , how ' s school going ?
word , college is tough , wishing you the best
and got upset with you ?
and why do not you try to teach your brother ?
good for you ! i hope it does not stress you out , though .
that is good . money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it .
dan ##g , how fast did you run away ?
did you tell him how creepy he is lo ##l
that is awesome , what types of photos did you find ? anything funny or silly ?
aw ##w yeah , those are great times that you can never really go back to . sometimes i also wish i could go back in time . . . maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years !
it ' s not fair , eh . having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself . at least it ' s comforting know that most everyone feels the same ?
maybe if we weren ' t so attached to being creatures of comfort . some things we just can ' t let go of , wouldn ' t exist without some poor sh ##mu ##ck having to do the dirty work . i guess we ' re all that sh ##mu ##ck to someone , some ##way or another .
oh wow , what o ##vie was it and how did it make you feel ?
oh wow that sounds very emotional , i think i would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears .
i liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
may be you are right . but sometimes , you go with your heart not with the law . murphy ' s law may not work in every situation .
oh no , i am sorry to hear that . how is she doing and how are you holding up ?
that is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her . i hope she gets well soon ! : )
oh no , maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her !
yes there is ! maybe throw in a cup ##cake too , i am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat ! i know i would . : )
i am so happy for you ! why have you been apart for the past two weeks ?
awesome to hear that you ' ll get to live with your loved one soon
oh no what happened , are you alright ?
oh no that must have been a terrible experience , i hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass .
that ' s what i like to hear ! what changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4 . 0 ?
wow . that ' s awesome ! you ' ll need that work et ##hic in nursing school for sure .
it sounds like you ' re quite the organized person !
i ' m the same way a lot of the time . it ' s really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters .
that is so exciting ! best of luck to you man ! i doubt she would reject such a great guy like you . : )
that is great , i would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you !
i wouldn ' t worry too much about it . none of it really matters , if we make a difference or not , we all end up dust in the end .
if telling yourself that makes you feel better , i found all of that to be much more stress ##ful . to be completely honest with you i think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death .
yeah , 70s were incredible , the dancing the cars , the women had style and the music was incredible .
but we got to make the best of it , pretty soon el ##on mu ##sk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again .
congratulations on your success ! i bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals .
there will always be people that are jealous of your success , but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace .
oh no , can you return it or get a ref ##und ?
i am sorry to hear that , i would have felt the same way .
that has got to be rough . at least it has a home now that hopefully has more time .
i ' m sure they will be great to him and he ' ll bring them joy as well !
oh no ! are you the jealous type ?
oh man ! yeah i would of felt the same way !
oh no do you feel ready for it ?
that is great , i believe that you will do amazing !
oh that sounds really annoying . maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help ?
oh i see , well good luck to you , i hope you ' ll solve it soon .
that is great , what has been going on in your life recently ?
that is good , sometimes that is all you really need to do , get things done one step at a time : )
they looked really exciting ! does it make you want to play it again ?
if it makes you happy then you should do it ! capital ##ize on that nos ##tal ##gic feeling while you can .
that is always frustrating . what happened ?
wow , some people are just terrible ! i hate when people don ' t take responsibility for their actions .
what did he do ?
oh no . what do you think caused him to do that ?
what was it that you accidentally ate ?
e ##w ##w that sounds horrible ! were you able to get a ref ##und at least ?
i ' m glad it went as planned . i can imagine that to be a very stress ##ful moment .
you ' ve really got to be committed to go into work like that . it ' s not for everybody , i agree .
i know how hard diet ##s are to stick to . what foods are you avoiding ?
don ' t be too hard on yourself , it ' s hard to quit something immediately . just keep trying , i believe in you !
i get it . there is always another meal to start making the change !
why not ? what happens tomorrow ?
don ' t let it worry you too much . just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly ! you can do it !
that sounds creepy ! is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car ? there is strength in numbers !
i definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife . stay safe out there !
i hope that all goes well . i am sure he will be good as new after !
i am sure the procedure will go excellent ##ly .
that ' s really cool ! i bet people really under ##est ##imated that under ##dog !
that ' s awesome ! maybe she ' ll come out of her shell .
he ' s a brave man . how was the experience ?
it sounds incredible ! hopefully it helped you conquer your fear !
congratulations ! worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic !
you ' re going to kill it this semester ! you ' re going to be so proud when you ' re walking down the aisle to get handed your degree .
did you guys write still write notes in each others ' books in high school ?
it ' s amazing how many feelings and memories me ##mento ##s like that can bring back .
that ' s awesome ! hopefully it comes back in one piece .
i think it will be fine . i bet the new car runs well .
im sure that is tough . you must really miss him .
do you get nervous being on your own ?
oh that sounds even tough ##er . it is a long time but i hope it flies by for you and your hub ##by is back home again .
im sure your not though !
that ##s horrible ! did you get the police involved ?
yeah i would have felt the same way .
yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this .
that ' s a ton of traffic . i hope they finish their project soon
that ' s unfortunate . i wish we could fly sometimes .
how lovely ! i such it was so nos ##tal ##gic to talk about old times together .
that is a brilliant idea . there is nothing better than catching up with old friends .
awe your such a caring and loving person ! are you going to keep it ?
the love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness !
oh wow , that must ' ve been a hard situation . especially later when you were more in control again .
that sounds like a good decision . good luck !
what ' s happening this weekend ? i hope you have some good things planned .
that ' s awesome ! i ' m very excited for you this is a good event for you !
that ' s interesting . are you okay ?
that ' s bad news . i hope that everyone is healthy and doing well .
why what happened ?
oh sounds scary ! i would have been scared .
oh no ! i hope she ' s forgiven you since then .
that ' s probably a good idea .
i ' m sorry to hear you were upset ! why did you have to quit ?
wow that is a long time ! hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former cow ##or ##kers .
hmm ##n , really ? . . i guess you must have felt very bad
am so sorry about that , did he apologize ?
aw ##w - i ' m sorry that happened . why were you embarrassed ?
it ' s always difficult when you feel self - conscious - but i ' ve learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself .
please try to be kind ##er to yourself ! you are a great person - with a lot to offer . always remember to be good to yourself .
in reference to what ?
my husband is my most trusted companion .
that ' s horrible ! i ' m a parent and i could never take money from my child . did you confront him ?
how frustrating ! keep your head held high and be strong . one day you ' ll be able to keep him from taking your money .
that ' s really nice , however , to keep the marriage fresh and strong , i think it ' s important for you to have outside friends .
ha ##ha , well i do know the feeling . i guess if it works for you , then don ' t change anything .
what did you do ? ? ?
well im sure you ' ll get over it . nobody should make fun of our mothers
stay hopeful ! , they ' ll release it sooner or later
it ' s all gonna be fine and you ' ll get what u want .
that is so sweet . it is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories .
that really does make it special . i ' m glad you have that .
. . . . what feelings ? what are you talking about
oh man , that ' s rough to hear from someone older than you . is she ok ?
that doesn ' t sound very good , but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with
other people deserve to have things , too .
oh no ! when that happens you have to get up and yell , " safe ! "
aw ##w ##w , well it happens to everyone sometimes . just try to forget it .
eh not really . what about you
and what does that mean practically ? what will you do differently ?
i love walking in nature . hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors
oh it ' s always sad when someone you care about leaves . can you at least keep in contact with him ?
i know . it is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least .
everything is going to be okay . try to relax .
if there is something in particular , try to deal with it head on .
that is great . . may i know what you have learnt
it is challenging i guess . . best wishes that you developed skill over it
great day to you too
how hard have you been studying ? exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time !
you sound very confident ! i wish i had your confidence when i was in school .
i bet you will do great ! what job is the interview for ?
that ' s a great field . my daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn ' t been able to find a job yet . good luck tomorrow !
good for you . being prepared is always better than the alternative .
don ' t get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it .
oh no ! you must feel really bad . are you able to fix the problem ?
please try not to be so hard on yourself ! we all make mistakes .
why do you need to go to the doctor ?
oh that ' s terrible . did they take care of it ?
that sounds very uncomfortable . were you honest with them about your change of plans ?
right .
oh i bet that was amazing ! i have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when i was young and it ' s a nice thing to think back on . does your daughter remember it ?
one day she ' ll look back and it will mean so much to her ! memories with parents are the best ones .
i totally understand , i hate carnival rides too , they always feel so rick ##ety . do you have a particular one you fear the most ?
agreed , a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards , but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me .
oh my goodness ! that sounds awful ! was this recently ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on . are y ' all able to visit him ?
that ' s so scary ! you must have strong intuition
i ' m so glad you came out of it okay . i hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse .
it was nice of you to at least think of it . i ' m sure she wasn ' t that upset .
it ' s totally understand ##able . life can get really busy sometimes !
oh , that ' s not good . did you get a warrant ##y for the phone ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope that everything works out for you .
did the other dog provoke him ? i wouldn ' t stress it too much , its just natural behavior for them , take him to training school .
oh then yeah , invest in a trainer . i love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous .
oh i ' m so sorry but i bet that was very special of you to find .
i would definitely make digital copies and up ##load to a cloud or a disk in case something happens .
that ' s awesome ! congratulations !
nice choice ! getting a b is definitely something to celebrate
that ' s exciting ! there ' s nothing like listening to your favorite music with great head ##phones
i agree 100 % . sounds like it ' s time to start download ##ing some new tunes to test out !
oh that ##s heartbreak ##ing , do you guys already have children ?
i really hope she gets better too , it must be terrible to know you can ##t have any kids . you ' re a good man for helping her cope .
young love , it ' s such a bitter ##sw ##eet quest .
i know right ? i wish i was young again sometimes .
it ' s always difficult losing a pet . i ' m sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they ' re gone
you just have to remember what a good life she had with you !
nice ! why do you like it more than other places you ' ve lived ?
that ' s good ! i ' ve always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town .
that ' s a blessing . i know a lot of people didn ' t have a mom like that .
is there anything she does specifically for her ?
i ' m sorry . i know how that feels . did you study really hard ?
oh , okay . maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy . i hope you do better next time .
that ' s sweet ! i have a great husband too ! how long have you been married ?
that ' s great ! we ' ve been married for almost 10 years and i still feel like a newly ##wed . it ' s great when you marry your best friend .
oh go ##sh ! that sounds frightening ! did you get out the taxi as soon as you could ?
oh , well that was a smart thing to do . i would ' ve bail ##ed . lo ##l
i usually love the trips down memory lane , but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around . i ' m sorry .
i ' m right there with you . it makes you shed a tear sometimes too .
oh . i know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations . hopefully you did this to protect someone ' s feelings
yeah , i think that means you have a conscience , which is a good thing . if you didn ' t feel bad , i ' d worry about you !
that would make a funny video ! we have a super friendly , playful cat too .
yes , they are . he is my daughter ' s best friend . she can do whatever she wants and he is un ##pha ##sed .
that was thoughtful , sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone . hope you didn ' t get kicked too much !
kids are interesting creatures that ' s for sure . i ' m sure you got some cool uncle points .
my mistake : )
i feel the same way about my dog . they ' re the greatest !
i don ' t know what i would do without my dog . i ' m glad you have one that ' s always there for you !
nice ! what did you have ? i am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight .
mmm ##m . that sounds really good ! i ' m thinking bis ##cuit and sausage gr ##av ##y , hash brown and eggs . . .
i hate when that happens . i bet you meant well but you ' re left looking like a crazy person ! i hope they understood .
i think they will get over it . most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing .
what happened ? the yard always has mysteries !
shocking ! has your kid done that before ?
maybe you should find him and apologize right now .
you could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead .
your welcome ! glad i could help !
i can understand the feeling , i went through a couple of spells like that in the past . i ' m sure they mean well but you ' re at a point where you ' re hurting to get back out there .
you ' ll return to self - su ##ffi ##ciency soon , you just can ' t let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt . stay confident .
aw ##w , that ' s so sad . i ' m an animal lover so i understand the pain .
that ' s a really tough decision either way . i wish you the best with it and hope everything improves
ah what a res ##pon ##si ##bly to take on ! you are a great example , is it quite tough ?
al ##ot easier than a kitten or a puppy then ?
keep up the good work !
i bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night .
all that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it .
living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too .
thanks that is quite the offer . how kind .
did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off ?
yeah you might want to look into it then
oh no ! have you tried taking your dog to the vet ?
yes , google has a lot of great information for pet care .
well that sounds like a high stress occupation !
i ' m glad you like it . i think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes .
i wish you the very best with it all !
you ' re welcome . be careful not to chase stocks too hard , they don ' t always turn the way you might hope !
i don ' t know what you can do . a duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog .
dogs gonna do dog stuff . that ' s just how they do .
that would be bad you should double check before you leave
yeah it is better to be safe than sorry
why were you ashamed ? did she disturb the neighbors or something ?
i ' m sorry that happened . you might need to get her obedience training ,
that ##s awesome ! do ya ##ll have any plans ?
lo ##l maybe ya ##ll could find something to bond over
yeah we don ##t thin ##nk about how special it was until it is gone
yeah we all do but we can only go forward
have you taken her to the vet ?
you might want to look up what is going on online
that sucks . next time they should tell you instead of laughing !
i ' m sure it ' s not so bad . at least you can laugh about it now !
that is great ! you should celebrate and enjoy this mom ##ment
that is good ! i hope you enjoy yourself
awesome ! what ' s it about ?
cong ##rat ##s ! i hope it goes well . are you presenting to a board of directors ?
maybe you can save more and be able to get one .
man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else .
the holidays are a great time for that sort of thing . what did your family do together ?
i understand what you mean . i hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other ' s company soon .
i hope you can have you applied or did you interview already ?
well have you practiced interviewing ? with that you can feel so much better !
i ' m sorry to hear that . hopefully something better is coming along for you soon .
keep working hard and i think your efforts will eventually be noticed .
ah that always sucks , did she need to go out or is she sick or something ?
well it isn ' t as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason .
oh no , is it painful and disrupt ##ing you in anyway ?
yeah , i know what you mean it does sound very scary , but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out , they fill in the cavity !
what did you do ?
it has been raining a lot here too . definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house .
that ' s good , sometimes it ' s good to just be lazy inside the house .
so are you making him a gift ?
don ' t worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it
do you have a general fear of flying , or is there something about this trip ?
have you always had a fear of flying ? i haven ' t ever really feared it , but i don ' t like it .
was it another boring day today ?
oh ##h okay i see , yeah i always get excited when new things happen at work too .
i know the feeling . hang in there ! tomorrow is always a new day
did you hide the wrap ##pers ?
there ' s very few brands i feel that strongly about . what kind of yo ##gur ##t is it , i might want to try it ?
i don ' t think i have ever seen that kind in the store , i ' ll have to look for it next time i go . i don ' t care much for the run ##ny yo ##gur ##t , but i like greek yo ##gur ##t so long as it ' s whole fat and sweet .
that is horrible . americas government won ##t be of help . . . . hopefully you have family ?
no cat or dog ?
yes i love animals and have 3 dogs right now .
i ' m sorry that happened to you and i will take your advice .
that sounds super scary , could he tell that your were scared or nervous ? how did you escape that situation ?
oh wow , it ' s fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive . i ' m glad you made it out of that awful situation .
that sounds a little scary . why was he running towards your car ?
did you give him any ?
aw ##w , i am sorry , but i must say pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good , did they help you feel any better ?
u ##gh , that sounds wonderful , i would do the same if i were stressed i think
that ' s amazing . were you impressed ?
that must take a lot of practice . i can ' t even jug ##gle safe objects so i ' d likely lose an arm if i tried to jug ##gle chains ##aw ##s lo ##l
me , too ! i work at the registration department at a college and we ' re very busy until school starts .
i think it ' s the feeling of the beginning of something new .
wow that is so sweet of her . she must really love you !
wow that is fantastic , she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person . : )
good for you friend ! i ' m sure you ' ll find something soon . what field of work do you want to be in ?
that does sound like a really fun job . i also work freelance and would also like something more stable .
oh no , they went on vacation without you ? ?
oh no that sucks , i am sorry that you had to stay home alone . what did you do to entertain yourself ?
oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . how are you holding up ?
yes , i am sure that your cat is in a better place . if you ever want to talk to someone about it i am always here to listen . : )
the big one ? the bar ? that ' s a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test ! i imagine you ' re very excited , but anxious too .
ah ##h . still , another stone set on the road to pay ##off . i wish you the best !
you study hard ?
oh no , i bet you ace ##d this one then .
oh no , have you talked to him about it ?
aw ##w man , that sucks , i am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slack ##ing off .
oh i would be pissed . hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate .
guessing he didn ' t get anymore food for dinner lo ##l .
i ' d imagine so . what a great time of our lives college can be . the world just seems right , being surrounded by your peers , all sharing similar goals .
mm ##hm . i wish i studied more , paid more attention , and joined more clubs . but i guess that ' s the thing , you ' re already as busy as it gets , and unfortunately you can ' t experience it all .
that is great , confidence is always a key in success ! i believe that you will pass as well !
yeah i bet ! you will do great , i have high hopes in you ! : )
aw , that stink ##s . why couldn ' t they come ?
that sounds really disappointing . hopefully , you ' ll be able to see them soon ! i ' m sure they were excited too .
oh man , i bet you did . i would have had a gag reflex if i saw some one pu ##king at the bar .
wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom . i am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight
me too , it ' s so hard not knowing what to expect .
right , no one truly knows until they get there , so scary .
what was the book about ?
i ' m glad you were happy reading the book .
oh , i understand . i also remember mine . do you remember something else about that day ?
i imagine it was a big college . what did happen at the end ?
me too ! i love that game !
i saw a machine one time that you could win live lobster ##s . they would cook it for you if you won .
nice ! how long has it been since you last saw her ?
man , i hope you two do something fun !
all spiders or just the poisonous ones ?
that ##s fair i guess , weird fish freak me out more then spiders through
wow , is she an older or younger sibling ?
aw ##w man that sucks , one day your hard work will pay off , so don ' t let it get to you too much . i am sure she is not intent ##ial ##ly doing that
om ##g ! i hate cock ##ro ##ache ##s , they are ugly insects
were you able to kill it ? what did you do ?
well done . i hope you don ##t find anymore , they are scary .
wow ! that is really cool . did he land the back flip ?
what prompted his back flip ?
it happens sometimes . it only becomes a problem if you forget often .
i hope they were pretty understanding .
i hate burger king ! mc ##d ' s all the way
adding mac sauce to a cheese ##burg ##er is a game change ##r
that is unfortunate , did you fail the test ?
you got this ! i believe in you !
wow ! did you tell them anything ?
you should stop being their friend !
oh , s ##ni ##tch ##es are no fun .
i would just keep to myself .
who ?
well i think as long as you say sorry , she can forgive .
i know how annoying that can be . i love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times .
maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention . dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes . good luck !
i have done that before . it is not fun .
i hope you threw out those pants .
o ##oh , what kind of trick did she learn ?
aw ##w ! i wish i had a dog now !
american football or soccer ?
okay . i ' m not really a fan of it .
yeah , that was a surprising result .
does it make you feel like you ' re living in an alternate reality ?
it can be scary at times . how do you deal with it ?
that is a good way . i have a dog that makes me feel safe . do you have anything like that ?
you can watch some movies
it depends on your preference . i watch korean dramas .
life is always a lot better when the sun is shining .
when the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile .
that is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with
my best friend is my boyfriend . so i share everything with him
same here ! where do you volunteer at ?
that is so generous of you ! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization ?
what are those
? ? ? is it a cancer of some sort ? ?
that is excellent ! i wish i had the courage to do so , too .
i think it would be fun to help someone build a house .
oh yeah ? was it because you didn ' t know if you could do the work , or because of all the hot college girls
well how did it go ? did you do well ?
that must be nice . i wish i had one .
yes , they do . and lots of care .
what about it made you feel nervous ?
yeah i understand . big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too .
i lost my dog last year , i miss her too .
i agree , they are the best .
that must feel good .
small things like what ?
wow that ##s completely unfair !
well i mean sounds like favor ##tism to me . siblings always get the better things
wow , lucky you . i play those once in a year only
i do not play too much because if i do not win , i feel it is a waste of money .
well that ' s good . what ' s the subject ?

you need to save your money to be able to afford it .
i can sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with you . i ' ve had a lot of betrayal in the past . the only thing to do is to continue looking for trust ##worthy individuals .

totally . i can ' t imagine losing my job . luckily the economy is pretty good , so maybe they will find new jobs quickly .
why are you moving ?
i would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life . i am sure you will enjoy university though
were they close to you ?
that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we ' re all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again
that is so heart ##war ##ming ##ly sweet . i know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well .
it ' s true they grow up so fast . this is why we should appreciate every second we have with them .

did you ap ##olo ##gis ##e to him ? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself ?
i ' m glad it made you more aware of what you ' re doing .
what are you going to do to change that ?
keep your head up high , good positive thinking .
what did you do to it ?
you are such a sweet soul . they say adopt and rescue , don ' t buy
i wish i could have heard your speech . it must have been really funny .
i hope he had a wonderful wedding . he must have been proud of you .

oh it can really hurt
its fair that way

oh go ##sh , all you can do is try to be there for her . but yes , 14 is so young to be a mother . i ' d be very upset too . i ' m sorry .
must have really brought back good memories . i love nostalgia .
it ' s a great thing these companies are doing letting you re - live the good old days when you ' re older !
oh no , how em ##bara ##ssing ! did anyone see ?
i hate it when that happens ! i hope you didn ' t hurt yourself , and that somebody tried to help ?
how did it eventually go ?
congratulations on a new job
oh no , i am sorry to hear that . that really sucks , maybe you can re ##app ##ly soon ?
i can understand that . i think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine !
oh no ! i confess i have done that to my kids !
ha , that ' s good ! mine haven ' t gotten sick from it either . i just hate to waste food !
amazing , did you rev ##ise for it , or are you naturally clever ?
that ' s cool - i never had the concentration to study that much
oh man , i would have moved out the next day .
i don ' t blame you . i ' ve never seen one before , i ' d hate to see one .
oh no . may i ask what you did wrong ?
where did they take you ? back to your parents or to the police station ?
did it work ? did you ever do it again ?
well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older !
were you happy for him ? or did you get sad because you didn ' t want that to happen ?
that ' s great , i ' m glad she ' s nice to you .
that ' s wonderful news , congratulations ! are you going to celebrate ?
i am so happy for you . you should get a nice dinner with your family .
did he find out ?
that ##s good you told him . that ##s a lot to keep inside . hopefully he wasn ##t mad
oh ##hh ##h , that is so bad . why did you cheat ?
oh no , sorry about that . but have you confessed to her
well that ' s great news congratulations , how long have you known each other ?
that ' s good that you put a lot of effort into it
ha ##ha , amazing ! did you get shouted at ?
that ' s really em ##bara ##ssing ! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it ?
what happened exactly ? is it just old and mold ##y ?
at least you got your money ##s worth ! are you going to have it installed ?
that is so lovely
memories are good to be kept in the med ##ulla . good old days . you really had a good time
aw . when you know , you know . how did you do it ?
i bet it was really special though ! christmas is such a beautiful time of year . when are you getting married ?
that ' s too bad . do you have proof of in ##fide ##lity ?
it ' s good that you ' re faithful . too bad your boyfriend couldn ' t be less flirt ##ati ##ous and respect you more .
what kind of food does it serve ? sounds wonderful !
surf and turf ! that ' s what they called a steak served with seafood . it ' s very yu ##mmy !
that ' s good , i love relaxing outside by a pool .
that ' s always a good feeling .
oh man dogs are crazy ! my dog killed a cat recently , i hope it ' s not poison ! ! is he okay ?
oh no , you are a good dog owner though
sounds like you are doing all the right things . did anything go wrong ?
oh that is great ! congratulations on your knew home ! that must be so exciting !
that ' s the cool ##est thing ever i didn ' t know you could have them as pets
my kids would love something like that
monkeys ! ! ! ? ? ? i have never heard monkeys howl . tell me more .
where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains ? i live in florida , the flat ##lands . lo ##l
sounds exciting . but i would have been scared of howling monkeys too . i am not sure why , but the term " howling monkeys " makes me giggle .
bye ! watch out for those monkeys !
oh that is so exciting ! ! ! good for you man !
yeah pop that champagne !
that sounds awesome ! what ' s your favorite part of your vacation so far ?
what kinds of fruit do they have there ?
that ' s great that they let you work in exchange for lessons . i bet you have the best memories .
that ' s awesome . do you own a horse now ?
that ' s awesome ! yeah i definitely find the more i study , the better i do . funny how that works !
true . there has to be a work / school / life balance .
well i hope he gets to fell ##ing better .
you should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick .
that ' s very consider ##ate of you . i know some people that drink it all and don ' t replace it .
lo ##l it happens , what ' s important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internal ##ize the knowledge .
aw ##w ##w , i never had one , but wanted one .
what were your favorite games ?
wow , that ##s terrible . did you get him to pay you all back ?
well good rid ##dance . if you never want to see sc ##um again , just loan them $ 20 .
i ' m sorry . it sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad . could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy ?
well that ' s good news . i hope you do better on your next test .
aw , i know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on .
that ' s good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel .
oh no ! that ' s ho ##rri ##fying in high school ! i hope you didn ' t get made fun of .
kids can be so mean . thank god that ' s all behind us now !
holy crap ! is there not a landlord or something you can complain to ?
i ' m glad i never had to live with other people . i would not be as patient as you .
did you pass ?
absolutely . great job !
i completely agree , having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits
yeah , and it can be cost effective if you plan wise ##ly !
oh my goodness ! that is scary ! are you alright ? did anyone get hurt ?
w ##he ##w ! you are lucky ! glad to hear everyone was ok .
oh no , poor dog : ( i ' d be devastated too , i love dogs so much .
don ' t beat yourself up over it , it was a very tragic accident but who could ' ve known . he ' s in a better place now .
that was nice of her . did everything work out ?
oh no ! did you guys still ##ha ##ve a nice evening ?
yeah i thought of that . well , the kids probably loved it !
very nice . how many shoes do you have ?
are they all ye ##ez ##ys ?
that sounds so nice ! are you very far from grocery stores and stuff ?
yeah , that ' s not too bad at all ! sounds id ##yl ##lic !
oh yes . the first car is amazing
yes i remember the freedom that comes with the first car .
i feel exactly the same way . people should be more consider ##ate and be on time for the sake of others .
yes , that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine !
i agree , it ' s something i struggle with as well . have you tried an diet ##s you liked ?
i ' ve tried a few , and i would have to say the one that i liked the most was weight watch ##ers . it ' s pretty easy to stay on , and the food is usually good . the only big problem is that it gets expensive .
that ' s so cool ! did they get you anything nice ?
time to go shop ##pin lo ##l !
i feel you , but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mis ##ha ##p are much lower than regular transportation .
i see , i think you may consider a ty ##len ##ol or some type of sleep pill for the flight , to ensure that you don ' t feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel .
that ' s awesome . i was always a daddy ' s boy growing up .
am ##en . mine was a good man . he taught me a lot of good life lessons .
i am sorry your dog passed away , i totally understand wanting to keep a moment ##o to remind you of him . was he old when he passed ?
i ' m glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive . : )
aw what a sham ! did they give any reason why they hired from the outside ?
well that ' s a good attitude to have . i don ' t blame you for being mad . i would be .
oh man , that is exciting ! do you know what kind ?
that ' s awesome ! ! i love jeep ##s ! congratulations , that ' s great news !
that ' s so sweet . what kind of bird is it ?
aw ##w , i ' d love to see a video of that .
you ' re lucky the cow didn ##t hurt you .
good thing you listened to your gut feeling
hopefully it will stop soon . that ' s the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand .
well that is what they get paid for . just be sure to tip him well .
uh oh . i bet he knew he was in trouble . did you get him a crate ?
yeah , i ' m glad you didn ' t do anything you would regret . i hope he is better for you in the future .
oh no ! i ' m so sorry about that . don ' t blame yourself , animals like to play with each other !
that sounds like a good plan . you definitely don ' t want that to happen again . sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again .
that sounds great , i can re ##me ##ber going fishing with my dad at that age . did your 4 year - old have a good time ?
wow , that ' s impressive ! i ' m glad he had a good time .
poor dogg ##y ! did you have to take him to the vet ?
i bet he did , i ' m glad he ' s okay though .
that ##s really nice you have a friend like that . that ' s hard to come by . i hope everything is better for you now .
i ' m sure he doesn ' t expect it but that ##s a really nice thing he did .
i hope you aren ##t and i ' m not too ! it would be rough living on the streets .
it would be terrible in the winter . i can ##t imagine sleeping outside when its freezing
that sounds fun ! where did you go ?
mmm ##mm , i love greek food ! that sounds app ##eti ##zing ! i think i will take my girl there too this week !
i ' m so sorry you feel that way . maybe you should talk to someone you trust . a family member or a friend .
i ' m sorry . you could seek out a professional to talk to . or you could just try meeting some new people .
what kinds of pets do you have ?
oh wow ! you did say a ton ! i love animals too . wish i lived somewhere i could have more .
did he have super ##power ##s ?
that ' s pretty impressive .
oh wow , are you going to be in front of anyone important ?
usually , you are the one who notices it the most .
wow , that must be an interesting thing to be involved with . lots of milk too , i pre ##sume .
very cool , wish i could get into something like that . sounds fun
aw ##w ##w , i understand . dogs are soo ##o great to be around and they are super friendly .
maybe also looking into getting a new dog , i know it ' s hard , but you can get through it ! your friends and family are always there as well .
that sounds like such an enjoyable life . if only it was so easy !
ha ##ha , that is true . but we have to make the most of this one .
oh man heart breaker . that ##s good ya ##ll are friends though . you never know maybe one day ya ##ll will be married
you don ##t still have any feelings at all for her ?
o ##oh , i ' ve always wanted to learn how to do that . you must be so excited !
om ##g , that would be awesome . i might just have to learn how to do that myself .
o ##oo ! that ' s exciting ! cong ##rat ##s on your baby ! i hope your guests enjoy their time .
ya ##y ! that sounds like so much fun . baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together .
usually it will let you know if something is wrong . part of how we are designed !
it is , everything has to be balanced just right , or else we feel it .
oh no , how did you make things right with the manager . i am sure he is just wanting to get paid .
that is a tough spot to be in , maybe you could of washed dishes for him . or give him your phone for collateral .
that is good , such an embarrassing situation to be in .
oh man i want that too ! did you get it ?
do you use your computer ?
how much do they go for ?
that ##s not bad . i have a r ##x 280
moving , is always such a pain . did it go smoothly at least ?
that ' s good , glad he wasn ' t having too tough a time .
oh man , i can ' t stand barking dogs . i wish owners would do something to shut them up .
that can make it so hard to sleep at night .
aw man , childhood is full of good memories ! i love the smell of straw ##berries .
ha ##ha , clearly strawberry . sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood !
your neighbor doesn ' t do anything about his dogs ?
if it were me , i ' d call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn ' t taking care of it .
really depends on the person i think . you can ' t have good people without bad people .
agreed !
you are very lucky my friend . there are so many children out there that cannot say the same , sadly . but so happy for you !
i guess it all comes down to karma , if you believe in that stuff . . . . . . i do . : )
what did you end up doing ?
it ' s good to have a partner .
i have a son , it ' s definitely nice to have some peace and quiet .
you must have been very happy when they returned home .
did you get it ?
that ' s disappointing . i feel sorry for you .
that sounds like a bum ##mer . hopefully , you did not lose too much .
yeah , but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much . some people put all the money on the line .
hey , that ' s awesome ! i hope you get it . when do you hear ?
well i hope you do . what kind of job is it ?
you must have been relieved you were able to help . did all go as plan ?
that ' s awesome ! i ' m glad it went through without a hitch !
oh , that ' s terrific ! what a great feeling that is , to be appreciated and valued !
oh , i love that you are so happy for her ! you sound like such a supportive and loving partner !
i also have two older pup ##pies , training takes time and care and love .
pup ##pies are smart believe it or not , use treats and don ' t yell or punish for their mistakes . a change of tone and placing them outside works really well .
i remember the lit ##e brit ##e toy . it was a nice toy to have .
i agree , the toys now days are made cheap ##ly and of poor quality . everything is about video games .
moving can be stress ##ful for sure , hopefully you had some help ?
it ' s like christmas ! only you already know what ##s in the boxes . the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization .
that ' s not good ! what did you do to try to get him to listen again ?
i bet that worked !
oh man , i ' m about to eat dinner over here ! lo ##l that ' s pretty gross . my cat pu ##kes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate .
i bet , hope the dog is feeling better though .
interesting , what was the issue ?
oh man , that is an issue , i hope he grows out of it
i bet you can ##t wait . where are going for your vacation ?
miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation . i wish i was going with you !
that sucks ! what were they upset about ?
it sounds like a very challenging environment to work in .
that ' s exciting ! when will she be moving in ?
does she live far away ?
that sounds very frustrating .
hopefully you ' ll able to get it all sorted out soon . i ' m sure when it ' s done it ' ll be a beautiful house .
what happened ?
i ' ve never tried vr , but just imagining that is scar ##ing me away from it .
cong ##rat ##s ! how exciting for you .
that ' s a long time to hold out hope . i bet you were shocked .
it always takes time . hang in there it will all work out .
i bet so too ! good luck to you both .
what subject did you choose ?
nice choice . i guess you have good relationship with your brother .
why was the officer yelling at her ?
wow , that ' s unfortunate . i would feel embarrassed for the lady
that ' s so wonderful . i love being cared for when i am ill .
it is an amazing thing to have a loving mother . everyone should show more appreciation to their mom ##s .
sorry about that , you could have taken a taxi
good enough you got home safe
did you have a good childhood ? you must miss a lot of things .
yes . nostalgia is una ##vo ##ida ##ble when we look back on our youth .
that ' s unfortunate . but at least you learned from the experience , right ?
no need to feel ashamed . we all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson .
that ' s nice that you helped him . i ' m sure he appreciated it !
yes , it really does . i am sure if you get sick , he will remember and do the same for you !
wow ! were you hurt ? was anyone else hurt ?
that ' s good news at least . i hope you are feeling better now . and don ' t be hard on yourself , accidents happen .
oh that ' s great , its awesome when the kids go off to school each year .
you ' ll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time , ha ##ha .
wal - mart is a place where weird ##ness always happens . can you tell me what happened , i ' m dying to know !
do you think he was pan ##hand ##ling you for money or a person who really needed it ? did you give him money ?
that must have been a very windy day !
i bet it will teach you .
i go to church every sunday i love it .
the people you can meet are super .
that
that is really not thing . i wish more people would do such nice thing . i know that made your day .
so you don ' t like to be alone . i am so sorry that affects you . so what would you do ?
yes , usually when one relocate ##s it ' s hard to make new friends , but eventually it will happen .
that was really nice of your old friends .
happy birthday . what was your favorite gift ?
nice . what brand of shoes were they ?
that ' s terrible . were you able to identify the kid ?
i ' m glad he was able to catch him .
wow , how was it ? i have never seen that trailer .
aw ##w , that is so sad to hear . he must have made some great movies !
are they twins ? !
aw ##w ##w ! twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time !
oh , i ' m sorry . what happened ?
i can imagine that you did want to run and hide . sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations .
i ' ve been in that situation before . did she find out about it ?
well that ' s all that matters . if she was okay with it . i ' m sure she was happy watching the episodes with you , even if you had already watched them .
that sounds like a bit of work . are you adjusting to your place now ?
that ' s what ' s most important . i ' m glad everything has gone well .
oh , i ' m sorry . why didn ' t you get to go with him ?
oh , that ' s too bad . i know exactly how you feel . hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun .
was it a lot of fun ?
that ' s great , but you don ' t have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful . i ' m sure you ' re gorgeous no matter what you wear !
it ' s ok , just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self - care as a habit .
what a great feeling ! you must love your dog .
she sounds like a great companion .
are you looking forward to it ?
exciting ! i ' m sure you ' ll do fine .
why is that ?
wow , that ' s no good . i hope they get it worked out soon .
i can ' t play those kinds of games . too sp ##ook ##y for me .
that would keep me up at night .
oh my go ##sh that ' s insane . well , i ' m sure you ' ll be able to control your impulse ##s in the future .
i ' ve been there before too . the important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow .
aw ##w , sounds like he is teaching the puppy . that ' s so sweet .
yeah , sounds like a pretty smart pup .
i do understand , i have a son myself . you just need to be patient and continue trying .
that is awesome . i am proud of him
gotta risk it for the bis ##cuit
i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
it can be nerve wreck ##ing . i ' m sure you will do fine , though ! have confidence !
you know they say , imagine them in their underwear . . . i wonder that really works . i ' m not fond of public speaking either .
did you spend a lot of the time on the project ?
i wouldn ##t get discouraged . maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time . i ' m sure , at least if you have a good boss , they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better .
nice ! enjoy it ! i like living alone . it is so peaceful ! i get lonely so ##mt ##ime ##s but for the most part it is great !
yeah , but they are all just a phone call away . keep your head up , your girlfriend will be there soon !
oh i know , mine too ! i love how all the colors change with the setting sun .
it reminds you of how beautiful life is .
wow , that ' s rude ! he won ' t last long . . .
yeah , some nerve on that guy . he should be grateful to have a job !
oh wow ! cong ##rat ##s ! ! how exciting ! ! how far along is she ?
lo ##l right ! ! ! it ' s way too hot to be pregnant right now !
you are so awesome ! ! ! i wish i had sister like you when i was pregnant .
i ' ve been in that situation before ! it can be scary
i ' m glad it worked out in the end ! i wish people would be more careful with their dogs .
oh , no . did you take it back or keep it
the store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long .
that sounds beautiful ! what emotions did they bring out of you ?
i ' m sorry ! what a lovely memory to have of her though . it ' s good to still have things in your life that remind you of her .
oh no ! that ' s so sad . i ' m so sorry , i know you must feel like crap .
i understand completely . i have things of my grandfather ' s that i can never replace .
sweet ! where did you go ?
that would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself ! my guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days !
i ' ve had similar experiences . what do you end up doing ?
have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle ?
oh no ! hope all is well with your dog .
good to read . always great to find a vet you can trust . looks like you did .
bb ##q sounds so good right now ! how was it ?
well that ' s kind of disappointing . it ' s always a let down when you go out and it isn ' t is good as you were hoping .
i completely agree . though , i ' m remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ; )
lo ##l . it kinda is . i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn ' t changed my job any .
that ' s terrible ! what did you do ?
that ' s good . i ' m glad your alright .
oh no ! that ' s so sad . you must ' ve been so upset .
hopefully you didn ' t and hopefully the other kids didn ' t make fun of you
what kind of car was it ?
oh i bet ! my husband wants an older car when we can afford it
oh no ! i would be devastated . did he pass , or missing ?
i am so sorry . i am sure you are . i would be devastated if i was in your shoes . does she have a chip ? maybe someone will get her to a vet office .
good job ! how do you think you did on it ?
that is a good feeling . time to celebrate before the grind starts all over !
yeah i like going straight to the point too
i like when i get places earlier than expected
i understand that completely ! did you have to get any work done ?
that sounds scary ! i always avoid going to the dentist until i absolutely have to . i know that ' s pretty bad !
oh no ! i hate when that happens . was he afraid or just didn ' t want to sleep ?
u ##gh , that ' s the worst . that happens a lot with my son as well . hopefully he wasn ' t too crank ##y today !
that is wonderful ! you must be happy , shows that he is getting bigger , soon it will be college
college is when the tear will start to flow . i love children .
that will be fun . what a great way to relax and un ##wind
i saw the weather forecast . we only have a 20 % chance of rain so you know how it is here . we ' ll be good .
that must be hard to do , he wants to be beside you . he is going to miss you .
yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights .
that is so sweet . what is her name ?
i can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes . i love dogs , i would like to have a dog someday .
that is very cute , the little one probably couldn ' t hold its bladder as long .
that was very smart of him , maybe he remembers back to his puppy days .
that ' s good . how is it going ?
that ' s great news ! it sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom , and was ready for it .
i ' m glad you didn ' t hit the dog ! did he jump out at you suddenly ?
i live out in a rural area where people don ' t always have control of their dogs . sometimes those little ankle - biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you ' ll hit them .
lo ##l , guess you were pretty hungry
yeah , might wanna go replace it
that sounds amazing . what ' s your favorite beach to go to ?
those are the best . especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches .
i sure it was beautiful
really , i would ##ve never thought that . i have a friend who is in dubai on a teaching assignment
yu ##ck , how gross ! !
lo ##l right , they could easily be your neighbors dinner
oh my go ##sh , i am so sorry for your family .
i ' m sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now . she ' s got this ! !
why do you live so far from family
i would like a new life . i totally understand
what ? that scary
wow , a hard lesson
i understand ! i live in the country and have the same problem .
yes . the only company available out here is century link and they just crash randomly all the time .
that is very cool . what took you all around the world ? what was your favourite place ?
what interesting stories you must have ! i think that would be really neat , but settling down is probably good too .
that is so sad . i hate it when pets die .
yes . they do like to have lots of babies
i am going on a trip to peru to visit mach ##u pic ##chu ! i can ' t sleep because of the anticipation !
i hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history .
yes , my friends are coming with me . : )
cong ##rat ##s ! did you do it because of football season ?
cool ! what ##s your fa ##vo ##iri ##te ? i like the office .
i have never heard of mr . robot actually .
same here ! i am glad you are doing well ! : )
i hope these feelings last for you !
a puppy ! that ' s so exciting ! are you going to keep it ?
i don ' t know that i would be able to give it up . 4 is a lot , but what ' s one more ?
well i ' m sure he will be , most guys are . i ' d never get to do anything if my girlfriend didn ' t trust me .
everyone gets jealous , it when you act on un ##founded stuff that is the issue .
yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
yes . especially men who want to mans ##pl ##ain things to you .
wow ! how much did he win ?
that is awesome that he gave it away ! maybe good karma will let him win again .
good choice . you could have broken down and never made it to school .
ha ##ha ! you are super lucky you are smart . lo ##l
everyone handles stress differently . my anxiety gets so high i sometimes cancel my plans .
i go to a psychiatrist and take med ##s , it just fix ##es what your body doesn ' t make , or do properly . it helps so much .
oh no ! it will be ok . it seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once . everyone gets through it !
sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is . gives you perspective .
i hope everything is fine , how did it turn out ?
im happy to hear that , a sick child is always a scary thing .
neat . where are you going ?
sounds exciting . have fun .
oh wow , are you feeling super en ##vious ?
ha ha , i don ' t blame you ! hopefully you can get the car you want soon though .
i ' m glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it ?
i ' m glad you was able to pin point the problem and i hope he stays in good health .
wow , that ' s so mean of them to laugh at you ! at least someone pointed it out eventually , right ?
that ' s em ##bar ##ras ##ing . but hey , i think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself ! don ' t beat yourself up for it .
wonderful i bet she is really content if everything is perfect . love to hear that someone is doing well .
i understand but try not to be jealous . good things will come to you to in its own time
the waiting must be very difficult and nerve wr ##ack ##ing .
things like that make me ants ##y .
a new hair ##cut can do wonders ! i always feel like a million bucks after .
i bet you looked great ! those compliment ##s would ' ve made me feel good too !
oh ? what specifically were you talking to her about ?
ha ##ha ! well , as we mature , we learn so much more about ourselves .
ha ##ha you are a good father . i hope you can make it through it !
oh my go ##sh ! i ' m sorry ! ha ##ha that ##s funny . at ##lea ##st you have them a story to always remember . ; )
oh no ! so what did you do ? !
that ' s nice of your neighbor ! your boyfriend should ' ve told you that there was no tooth ##pas ##te earlier . maybe there would ' ve been time to get some . but at least you didn ' t go to work with stink ##y breath , right ?
ha ##ha everyone has to do that once . can you tell me a great story about the party ?
ha ##ha ##ha that ##s funny . i hope you guys are still on good terms . to be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix .
wow , cool . maybe you can ask to tag along ?
that ' s too bad . well , at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself .
that ' s amazing ! how old is she ?
wow , that must ' ve been a big thing for both of you .
i am sorry i do not know what nc ##le ##x is but i wish you good luck
o ok i hope that everything works out for you
wow ! did you try to get it out ?
that ' s amazing ! he probably loves you so much
do you feel nice and ref ##resh ##ed though ?
i did the same thing today , so you are not alone in your behavior friend !
oh no ! did it break ?
oh , that really stink ##s . i hope you were able to get another one .
did you do some neat doctor stuff on it ?
oh ye ##a that sounds like you did a good job !
that is good , how long did it take before you go him to this point ?
yeah i understand , it is good that you took him there though
wow they must be doing well . why don ##t you try to get one ?
sounds waste ##ful to me . life isn ##t about material things anyway .
yeah sometimes kids say things that they really don ##t mean in the heat of the mom ##ment
well maybe you guys should talk
u ##gh my neighbors do that sometimes . it ' s the worst ! i think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone .
ic ##k . hopefully the smell is fully gone now
oh that is the worst feeling ! i hate using the restroom in public as is .
maybe . for me i just don ' t want to cause a stranger to be em ##bara ##ssed lo ##l
i am with you , i like it a lot more than summer personally
i feel that , i hate being hot . in the winter i can be com ##fy and i can always just put on a jacket if i get too cold , but in the summer it is not that easy .
i was very nervous . i did not know if i would pass or not .
did you pass the test ?
i am the same way , i barely make anything compared to a lot of people i know
i think cities are more expensive , like living costs , so i do not want to live there ether personally
i ' m assuming that he / she didn ' t return it in time . i ' m sorry .
oh , i understand . did it bring it to you at all ?
that is amazing ! i ' m really happy for you !
it sounds like you really deserve it !
that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?
at least your ok , thank god for that
nice , for what position
that ' s pretty great , you must really take the initiative . good job
you ' re much brave ##r than me . i would never host a dinner party . . don ' t feel like i ' m good at planning , and don ' t feel like i ' m interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people .
i think , maybe , yeah ! it depends on who ' s there , and if i felt comfortable with the host . if i felt like i had enough people to kind of " rescue me " and who i could talk to at the party if i got anxious and couldn ' t talk to strangers , then that ' d be alright . other than that , i just kind of do like maybe a group of 4 , max
aw , that ' s too bad . you did the right thing by telling her though .
maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one .
i am right there with you ! god is good and wow , he ' s been with me through so much hardship . i ' m so happy you feel the same way .
yes , we can always count on him to know the bigger picture and have faith that he ' s working for our good . hope you have a blessed day !
they really have changed . i know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time .
those were awesome ! my favorite was the coke commercial at christmas time . so many memories !
oh fun ! how big was it about ? did it have neat markings on it ?
i think i saw someone post a picture of those online . maybe it was a lunar moth ! what a fun experience !
what is your niece ##s name ?
that ' s amazing , was it your sisters first baby ?
it will be amazing ! i should do that too !
that sounds so great ! i hope your plants grow beautifully !
that sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down . getting out in the sun and outside the house / bed is so good . i ' m sorry you ' re struggling with depression . i understand .
i am so glad ! you know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self - care . i try to do that as well as med ##itate and pray in the morning . really ref ##oc ##uses me . i ' m glad you ' re feeling better !
i imagine , are you prepared for it ?
oh yes , last year with hu ##rac ##an ir ##ma we went without power for 5 days .
aw , did it bring back a lot of good memories for you ?
that ' s awesome . sometimes i wish i could be back in my childhood . maybe if only for a day . ha ha .
i am sure it ' ll be ok . usually if you stay in contact with them and don ' t blow them off for a long time it will be ok .
i would call them . they usually give you some credit for that .
that ' s good . i assume you have studied hard and are prepared ?
good luck ! you will do great !
ha ##ha , i ' m sorry but i had a little laugh at that . it reminded me of the time i did that to my teacher in school . i was embarrassed , but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it ' s a common thing that happens , since they ' re female authority figures that you can easily mix up .
yeah , she knew what you meant . she probably forgot in two minutes , while you ' ve thought about it for much longer . the best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously , which it sounds like maybe you did .
that ' s gross , why are they coming in ?
you should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house .
i sure wish it wasn ' t . i live far from my family and they can ' t even make time for me to go to them . so i feel for you , it is very sad .
absolutely first . especially when you don ' t live close .
i bet it wasn ' t com ##cast ! they wouldn ' t even give you a cup of water for free .
i am glad you had a nice experience ! its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers !
oh , wow ! that is crazy , have you talked to the vet ?
i thought it would be normal . good thing to be cautious .
well it is a good thing you un ##pl ##ug ##ged everything !
that is a good lesson to learn early , i am glad everything turned out okay for you !
that sounds amazing ! but terrifying too lo ##l
i admire you ! i don ' t think you ' ll regret getting this experience
ha ##ha ##h that is funny . were your parents angry ?
ha ##ha did they believe it ?
nice , what system do you play on ?
i really enjoy video games as well
that ' s the worst ! have you tried talking to your neighbor ?
you might try contact ##ing the authorities , though i don ' t know if it would help .
that ##s awesome ! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
did he enjoy the toys >
yeah that can be nerve rack ##ing ! how did it go ?
that is good ! are you guys close now >
good job ! do you feel pretty prepared ?
wow ##za ! cong ##rat ##s ! is it a job you can build a career out of .
oh that ##s good ! thanks for teaching . : )
my mom is one so i know how important you guys are .
man . . i need some of that luck !
wow that ##s awesome ! i never win anything like that
i agree ! i wish i was able to make things
for sure you are born with those types of talents !
that is cool ! i love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television . i sometimes watch old shows on youtube that i used to watch as a kid . love it !
i used to watch the wonder years after school . i love watching it until this very day .
that must have been embarrassing , i hope you weren ' t to trauma ##tized
that is good to hear , it was a motivation to succeed , a great character building
aw man that sucks . it must have been a crazy storm .
how big was it ?
you shouldn ' t think about death whilst you ' re alive ! just live each day to the full ##est .
yes but death comes to all of us someday . so i think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it .
that is a good test of friendship . did he keep his word ?
it is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend .
nice ! i hope you get it , i ' ll cross my fingers for you also ! do you think you got a good chance ?
that ' s all you can do , but if you worked hard , i ' m sure you will get it !
oh cool . were there any good picture in there ?
well that ' s nice . i am glad they were happy memories for you .
oh boy . i ' ve gotten quite a few of those before . new hairs ##ty ##list ?
that ' s odd . i would ' ve told him so and asked for my money back .
oh ##hh ##h , disgusting . what did you do ?
i bet , what a terrible feeling !
oh man , your making it even worse . i never even thought about that . now i want to throw up .
is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself ?
yeah i can understand that ! ! id want to get it over with too . the sooner the better
oh my , i hope that doesn ' t mean more work ##load for you .
maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work !
yeah , flying can be scary .
hopefully it isn ' t a long flight .
that ##s awesome that you trust her
its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays
oh no ! that ##s horrible . were you driving ?
oh go ##sh that is horrible . i am so sorry that happened to you .
that ' s the worst ! because now you ' ll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there . that must be an anxious feeling .
yeah , i ' m not quite a ho ##ard ##er or a pack ##rat when it comes to those things , but i do get sentimental with some physical objects . if i lost them , i ' d feel like it would be an it ##ch i couldn ' t scratch , because i couldn ' t replace what i lost . hopefully you can work past it somehow .
oh man , that ##s the best feeling in the world . getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly lau ##nder ##ed sheets .
it ' s such a wonderful feeling , i should take a shower soon too .
how did you you go over your budget ?
i hope you can have better self - control in the future .
aw ##w ##w . that is good news !
how long has it been seen you ##ve seen each other ?
oh go ##sg . do you have some greedy roommate ##s or something ?
ha ##ha ##ha ##a good point . maybe try hiding your groceries .
ye ##a i have
that ##s great , happy for yo
literally me right now actually
must be nice to have someone that loves you
what is going on with your work ?
you can do better next time i believe in you !
ou ##ch . why ?
oh i see . very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though .
its not so bad , it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there
once you figure the way it just becomes routine
you are so right , did you read that somewhere ?
that is cool , have you studied any philosophy in school ?
yes , i feel that every day .
i wish people understood how precious life really is .
why did you throw your laptop ?
sometimes i lose my temper like that too .
wow that ##s vivid , what game was this ?
ah yes league , love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more
oh no , i hope it wasn ' t an important meeting .
sorry to hear that , were they understanding about it ?
i ' m sorry your wife is sick . what kind of soup is it ?
that sounds quite delicious if i must say .
yeah . reminds me of the good old days !
yeah same here . i remember one time awhile back i took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard . that was some good times !
yi ##kes , that ' s a tough one and i can definitely feel your pain on the job market . i think either network your way to a higher pay job ( depends on connections ) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees .
yes but the market is quite flooded with cs degree holders . it ' s hard to get something unless you are specialized i think . unfortunately i don ' t see society changing any time soon .
life is the most beautiful thing .
i live every day like it ' s my last .
waiting in line is the worst .
i hope you got your classes .
sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself !
i agree that it is as well . in most situations , it can work to one ' s benefit .
i don ' t understand what you are trying to tell me . is this a joke ?
why would they want to do that ?
i can imagine the flood of emotions .
i hope it was worth visiting .
sounds like you are prepared . i like the confident attitude . go get them !
i would love to come with you to yours . lo ##l , i just invited myself .
i completely understand . maybe you need a vacation to rec ##har ##ge the batteries .
are you looking for a new job ?
that ' s not true i ' m sure . do you have any friends to hang out with ?
i can understand . maybe connect with some like - minded people online ?
e ##w ##w ##w that ' s gross ! did you help clean it up ? and what was in that pizza anyway ? ?
he seems like a good friend .
the future certainly can be scary .
i am curious for what the future holds .
oh wow , the whole cake ? has she found out yet ? was she mad ?
if you can and have time , i ' d try to get a quick replacement and explain to her . maybe she ' ll understand .
oh cool . how does it work ?
oh that ' s easy peas ##y . sometimes i only have to wipe once when i go number 2 .
oh man , i would be so jealous . when will it be your turn ?
i think your boss should give you more recognition in that case !
that ' s good ! you ' re awesome ! family is what is important
i agree !
ready for all those ice breakers ? those amazing crazy party ? what are you hoping to do this year ?
yeah defiant ##ly , my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that ' s the one thing we seniors always wish we had done
what ? what happen ##d ? why are you angry ?
really ? was it about something very stupid ?
i think that ' s a kind of natural reaction , especially if it is just a hobby . i would have a fear of being judged .
definitely . i feel the same speaking foreign languages . it ' s more of a self - conscious thing .
that does sound like fun ! where do you guys plan on going ?
that sounds like a good time . not the usual country you see people vacation to
that ' s awesome ! it ' s so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything .
i think you have the perfect outlook . i hope i can strive to maintain something like that as well .
what did he do yo ##lo ?
this is absolutely the worst ! he is no man in my eyes !
oh , yu ##ck ! that ' s gross . did you get sick too ?
that ' s rough ! my husband always did with the kids when he was home .
don ' t be ! i know this is over ##used but trust me , it ' s not as hard as everyone else makes it to be , if you focus and aim for your goals , you will get it ! i know you can do it !
don ' t be , i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out
it really is , what can we do to help ?
that ' d be a good idea , we could all start biking .
what was the project ? 1
you must be an expert on nutrition then !
what are you looking forward too ?
which country ? that sounds fun , are you guys doing anything fun there ?
yeah . it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
yes . hopefully all will go well
are you his best man ?
i hope he does , being the best man is an honour and you ' re ready for it .
sounds quite interesting to code
oh dan ##g i never really da ##bbled that deep when i did my small share of programming
what happened ?
i hope all goes well so you ' re as happy as possible .
that ' s good ! i hope you had a good time ?
yes , it ' s great when you run into an old friend you haven ' t saw for a long time .
what are you planning on doing with it ?
that sounds so ad ##mir ##able , i ' d love to see you grow to an amazing person .
why don ' t you go get yourself some food ? or just order some ?
oh god i get you ! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture .
wow , sp ##ook ##y , what did you do next ?
that must have startled you
you having money problems ?
i don ' t think i ' ve ever had a delivery guy be that late . i ' d be mad .
oh , that stink ##s . . . literally ! i have pets too so i know how you feel . my cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up !
it is , i wished they could just use the toilet like we do !
that ##s good ! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
that does have to feel really good
yes , where do you live ?
i love colorado . i visit all the time .
yeah , we have a lot to be thankful for . we take for granted many of the per ##ks of being a us resident !
i agree . there is a lot of suffering . i am glad people like you and i recognize that .
that is great . where are you selling your pops ##icle ?
i understand . good luck .
you were probably just being you .
ha ##ha ! that ' s usually the case . : )
i understand . is your family living far from new york ?
it is always cool to have family and friends close by .
that is a great minds ##et to have ! you must feel very happy and content !
why do cities make you feel that way ?
oh no . . and no one really likes pumping gas .
you could grab it when she ##s done with it and fill it up real quick for her !
did you give it back or just walk away ?
yeah , that is a hard one to deal with . maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself .
i would ask the real ##tor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place .
kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - def ##f look into it !
i ' m sorry to hear that . . . sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don ' t get overwhelmed .
therapy is a good thing . its is nothing to be ashamed of .
maybe it isn ##t your body , but also your partners ! something to check into to see which end its coming from , but none the less it will happen !
it ' s hard to trust anything , even the o ##at ##me ##al recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray .
that ##s kind of you , did everything go well when you put it back into the wild ?
sounds like it went well !
yes , i hate those kind of people . they have nothing to do expect lying about other people .
i just ignore them . at some point , they stop but they understand that it is not working .
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he is feeling better .
it is . taking care of sick child is hard . missing work is also hard . the things we have to do for our children .
sounds like something on a movie ! what a work day right , my god . bring extras next time ? lo ##l
i bet they were lo ##l at ##lea ##st you can laugh about it now .
that ' s very sad , has he considered getting help for his addiction ?
i can certainly understand your feelings , i hope he can somehow fix his habits .
has it been a lot of fun ?
oh yeah i remember those old halo days too during my childhood , such a great game .
i understand that feeling . it wouldn ' t make sense for us all to want to do the same things , especially if you ' ve part ##ied before already .
that ' s cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don ' t feel ob ##liga ##ted to do things just because of norms .
oh that ' s great ! does it come with a nice raise ?
do you kind of feel like there ' s no where else to go ?
i am so happy for you ! all of your hard work paid off !
that is great accomplishment ! i wish you well on your new path in life !
oh my . . . i hope you didn ' t hurt yourself .
since you didn ' t hurt yourself i think i will have to laugh . it sounds like it was funny .
ye ##a , i feel the same way . it ' s worse when you have to pass by them twice a day .
heck no . be en ##vious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them .
o ##oo ##h , how exciting ! ! what kind of car did you get ?
i ' ll bet it is ! best of luck with your new truck !
indoors ?
in the 6th grade ? where is this school ?
makes sense . i live in the states . we have no money for such things .
how big a bird was this . i don ##t remember anything from the 6th grade .
wow ! ! that ' s crazy . i ' m like that though . i never win anything either
ha ##ha right ! maybe you should buy a few and see what happens . you can ##t win if you don ' t play
oh god , i am so sorry . is he okay now ?
i hate to hear that . it is so hard to lose a pet . i hope you are doing okay through this .
do you not fly often ? it isn ##t too bad .
well if it is a bigger plane it isn ##t as bad . just bring some head ##phones and listen to some comforting music .
you have to be more careful next time , maybe you need a calendar to remind you .
i am so sorry to hear , i am glad that it didn ' t cause a lasting effect .
that is a fantastic feeling . i hope you get it .
keep riding that confidence . it will get you places . it sounds like you deserve it .
that must have been a bit scary , you should have called the police .
you cannot be too careful these days , i am so sorry that happened to you .
okay ! now that is interested , i would love to see them .
oh really ? i will be checking it out . i would love to have some .
free ? that makes it even better , i will be getting me some posters .
i hope so too . thank you so much !
i am afraid of spiders . i would run and scream . what happened afterwards ?
i would move out of that room . maybe you need to spray the area .
oh no ! did it end up raining ? did you take rain gear ?
that sounds like it was a lot of fun !
im sorry to hear that it can be hard ; /
yeah i would get a pet
that is so sweet of you . i love cats , you must be a caring spouse .
the cat didn ' t like you , oh dear . i am so sorry that happened . you need to spend more time with the cat .
i have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
well you could always work out and turn it into muscle
its a good guard dog then
what kind of dog is he
animal accidents can be really bad !
at least no one else was injured , but it is sad about the cow .
just cher ##ish the moments
it will be okay
what kind of job is it
that is a nice job i am sure
uh oh ! did you get in trouble ?
that is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake . i am sure they appreciate that .
awesome , cong ##rat ##s ! i ' m not too familiar with the o ##culus rift , is there a particular game you ' re eager to play ?
robot games are always fun . i bet you ' ll have a great time !
o ##oh how so ? were there a lot of hills and sharp turns ?
i see . do you think you ' ll be going back on that bike trail ?
i hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip !
what kind of con was it
that is really cool ! i like in texas so i can ##t go to stuff like that
that sounds amazing ! how did everyone do ?
awesome ! hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace .
why did you do th ##t ?
that makes sense , you are a good older sibling !
i would imagine , that is a lot to drink !
i get that , well i hope you feel better ##now !
why is that ?
i get that , did your friends know how to ride bikes ?
well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot
aw ##w that ' s sweet . did you cry ?
why hold them back ? it okay to cry lo ##l
oh , i am so sorry ! i used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes . . . we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him . i can relate to how you feel . . .
our pets are our family . . . it ' s not easy to see them suffer . . i feel for you . and thank you about our dog .
oh no , what happened ?
that is terrible , you must have been devastated , i hope he find the help he / she needs .
oh dear , but are you allowed to sing at work ? that must be so annoying .

i don ' t think that i have seen / heard one of those since the 90s . . . possibly the early 2000 ' s at the earliest ! crazy , i didn ' t know that they still exist either !
i loved that too !
that is wonderful to hear , good for you . there ' s way too much cr ##azi ##ness in the world making people unhappy . it ' s nice to hear someone is doing well and happy .
di ##stan ##cing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to ins ##ulate yourself from that stuff .

awe that is great ! i am glad there was a happy ending !
oh man i ' d be mad too . . . you should wait outside with a paint ##ball gun
yu ##p gotta lay down the law
terrifying ! what was it ?
oh good . i bet ! i wouldn ' t have been able to go back to sleep after that ! do you have to replace the pump ?
o ##ops . i hate when that happens . did they say anything to you ?
that was really nice of you to apologize like that . some people would have just ignored it . i know that could have been embarrassing .

you must really trust your friend ! how did that turn out ?
good to hear that it went so well . do you think you ' ll let your friend watch him again ?

surgery on my kids always scares me but i have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young
i understand , when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still
oh for sure . i hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
were at work today or doing something else ?
interesting . how do you feel about it ? do you find it fun and interesting , or wish she were more responsible with her money ?
yeah , i can understand that . sometimes when you ' re not in a position to enjoy yourself because you ' re busy being tied down with responsibilities , it ' s easy to get mad at others . whatever you can do to spin it positively , i would suggest that . being negative about it will only make everyone ' s lives worse .
oh my go ##sh ! that had to be super scary !
yeah , thank god you are safe . i don ' t know what i would have done if that happened to me .
yep i thinks its di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful and petty . what happened ?
