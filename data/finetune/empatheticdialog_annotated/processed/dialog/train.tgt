doing good . . how about you
it ' s quite strange that you didn ##t imagine it
and that ##s something you should never do , good on you .

i work remotely , i wish that you could do something like that as well .
sometimes in life , it is not about performance . some people just get a shine ##r spoon .
that ##s a sweet man , i hope you acknowledged his kind gesture .
their aren ' t that many well rounded people in the world these days so when you see one you should always show appreciation !
what happened ?
i am sorry to hear that . i hope you find a better opportunity . did you know why they rejected you ?
wow ! did it do any damage ?
that is great . i would have been scared to death . was it recent ?
ha ##ha yeah that would be very bad !
oh no , sorry to hear that happened to you : (
what happened for you to feel that way ?
oh that does sound terrible . what did you guys decide to do ?
that ' s very scary . i hope no one got hurt .
so happy everyone was fine ! ! everything else can be fixed .
so good to hear . might want to trim some trees lo ##l
i saw that game . they won on penalty kicks !
it was very tense . the other game with england and sweden was not nearly as nerve - wr ##ack ##ing .
it must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over . is she older ?
my aunt does the same thing ! i think what she is doing is accidentally del ##eti ##ng texts , and she doesn ' t understand how to check her contacts list . what do you think is happening with your co - worker ?
what is the problem with the engine ?
sorry to hear that . i hope you find what is the problem with the engine .
i felt sad and depressed due to my ins ##ec ##urities and felt rejected from society
the problem is i don ' t think you can grew out of my specific ins ##ec ##urity .
i ' m not familiar with abs ##eil ##ing , but i ' m glad that you felt good about it .
oh , i see . no , i ' ve never done that .
hello ! i am in such a good mood since i got my new home .
i have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for . camping would be a fun one .
i want to look in to getting a nice fire pit for the house .
what kind of house are you building ?
that sounds great . what are you most excited for ?
why did you feel guilty for taking a drink ?
i can understand . i am not a big drink ##er myself , but i wouldn ' t feel guilty about it . not unless you promised someone you wouldn ' t drink .
oh ye ##a i can understand that then . . . well i am sure you learned your lesson , right ?
yeah that sounds really sad . i am sorry for what you went through .
yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made .
wow , that was so awesome of them !
i had to buy my first car and it wasn ' t until i was 21 that i could afford it .
that is where i am still at , i am scared i will have regrets when i get older
that is good , i am glad you have no regrets !
what was the topic
i ' m not familiar with him where is he from
and how did you learn about him
yes , i think that everyone does ! what about you ?
that ' s too bad . our jan ##itor is very friendly .
is it not better you replace it with same type of statue ##tte , at a grocery store ?
the mother of your grand mother , that means your great grand mother ! well you can search through her archives
what happened ?
it is very bad service . what did you do ? did you complain to the manager ?
that would be hard to do and take courage .
i could see that happening but sounds like you were super brave .
oh , my , what happened ?
i live near the ocean , so i do understand how this can be . i hope you ran , very quickly .
i heard a story of sea ##gul ##ls drowning a man to death .
i was the same way .
lo ##l . i take away my daughters now . i guess my mom passed the torch .
she is 13 not at 3a ##m
what promise didn ' t he keep ?
wow that sounds like a terrible friend . i hope he had a good reason for not showing up .
wow . did he have kids ?
ah ok . good you stayed committed to your wife .
that is very inspiring , i ' m glad you take the extra time . do you like doing what you do ?
that is awesome , thanks for taking the time to help kids grasp a new language ! you deserve to be appreciated , but i ' m sure they appreciate you a lot .
that is heartbreak ##ing , it ' s always helped me to remember that no matter what happens , you have your memories with them .
absolutely , it ' s a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories .
i ' m sorry to hear that . that must have been frustrating .
hopefully you were able to get the ice cream that you wanted in the following days .
oh no ! glad your dad was able to help . how did it happen ?
that ' s some bad luck . i hope it wasn ' t too much of a has ##sle .
awe how sweet , i bet those are good memories
i agree with that for sure .
i bet ! that sounds like fun .
what sweet memories to hold on to .
that ' s awesome ! how helpful where the other people so that you could enjoy your trip ?
must have been super fun . how were the local people ? how did they treat you ?
that ' s great ! im glad that they took care of you ! have a gr ##et day !
i ' m sorry to hear that . do you know what caused it ?
i ' ve done that to myself before . now i always wait awhile to sleep after eating .
what were you afraid of ?
oh no , well glad to see you are here still !
what is your job position ?
that ' s very bad
what did you do ?
ou ##ch . . . is it just for a day ? is your friend a safe driver ?
yes . . . if this makes you feel better . . i lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright .
ha ##ha my girlfriend does the same thing . check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks , then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories .
we all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then .
yeah it ' s really frustrating when they won ' t have more e ##ople on .
exactly . hopefully more places will get self - check ##out so we can get through the line faster .
yeah , or at least do something to correct that .
or hire more people maybe also
they don ' t spend money unless they absolutely have to . they get bonuses for saving money i think
and then what ?
i understand , that must suck
that ##s terrible . . . have you gotten a new phone yet ?
that ##s true , but i hope some good luck comes your way soon . .
oh well , where did you move ?
wow ! ! wonderful isn ' t ! ! you would have been over the moon once you moved . .
oh no , that ' s terrible . sorry you had to deal with that .
i am sure that threw a wren ##ch in your plans . how frustrating !
what ##s your favorite food ? that was very nice of them
oh nice , im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies
that will mess you up for a few days . the only thing i don ' t like about going away .
oh no . hopefully everybody gets back to normal soon .
i only like yard work with the kids . they do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt .
oh no . the shower is the plus side to all the dirt i guess . i once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower . i quit that day .
oh my go ##sh ! i would have been so upset ! nothing is better than chocolate ##s on a bad day .
that ' s definitely better than nothing . i hope your days have been better since !
that ##s so special ! what a beautiful moment . . how old is she ?
my daughter is 1 . 5 years old - she ##s just been introduced to the water . . its always so special when our babies have their " first " moments . cong ##rat ##s mama !
have you thought about talking to your boss about it ?
you should still speak to him about your concerns .
this is terrible . so sad to hear that . what did you do then ?
did she already move out ?
what do you mean ? i don ' t know what you are talking about .
well then i guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt . i hope you called a ambulance .
i would have gotten out right then i believe .
i guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath
wa ##o , that sound like a great strong real ##tions ##hip you have with her , so glad to hear that !
when my first da ##ug ##ther was born ! i saw in new life , i thought everything in the world can change , we need to be pure as kids .
when i see them , i believe th ##i ##w world in which we live fill with envy and hate can be re ##wed
that ##s good that you found the key ##chai ##n
that ' s very good ! always nice to find those old lost items .
that is seriously the worst . . . waiting around all day wondering what ##s going on ! have you tried calling him today ?
of course right , i would try angie ##s list or home ##ad ##vis ##or ! they can find you a new one . . .
oh no . i am sure he will get caught eventually though .
things you do usually come back to you .
what event was taking place ?
that ' s cool you were on stage for that . were you one of the musicians ?
oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation ?
sounds rather special to me ! out of the country or to another state ?
that is great . it is sweet to see them grow and learn . how old is she ?
funny one ha ha
it is so sweet . is she able to talk ?
that should be funny to see and hear
that sucks . . . what was he or she supposed to help you with ?
well i hope you two can talk it out , express your feelings and work it out together ! friendship is hard to come by these days . . .
traveling is hard work . where did you go ?
wow . i have never nee ##n that far ! i have been to the caribbean though .
that ##s awesome , friends really can be the best . how long have you known them ?
im glad you have such good friends in your life , it makes life easier .
om ##g . . . that ##s terrible ! im so sorry - iv ##e been through similar . are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off ?
if they have a heart or soul they will ! they really should . . .
that is really cool ! did they tell you why they were giving you the bonus ?
well at least you get something to look forward too at work .
what was it . i ' ve been too busy to notice new movies out .
they do put out good movies most of the time . i will try and check it out .
what are they doing to cause you to think that ?
i have heard that too . you might want to contact your local district .
no problem i hope everything works out
happy birthday ! ! ! ! what are you going to do for it ?

oh no ! bugs really creep me out !
what did the land ##lor do about it ? did you have to call an ex ##ter ##mina ##tor ?

that is nice . i like going to water park . what time are you going ?
is it a big water park ?
are you ok , you have to tell me what happened .
ah ##h that has happened to everyone before . it is embarrassing but you will get over it .

oh no , that ' s scary , is she okay ?
that ' s good , i ' m glad it wasn ' t serious .
what are they doing that is upset ##ting you ?
have you made a formal complaint against them yet ?
you should report it to your local police department . building and documenting this can help you .
that happens a lot . what happened next ?
i know the feeling . i hate driving now . everyone is looking in their phone .
i th ##nk the driving age should be raised to 21 personally
please tell me that he was friendly and nothing creepy !
thank god ! lo ##l i was like please tell me this was a positive experience . . .
that would pretty amazing . what will you do with the winning ?
i think the same really . making sure everything is paid off , having a roof over your head , etc . . . is what most people would want to take ca ##er of first .

that is good
that ' s awful , i ' m sorry to hear that . i lost my job once as well and times got really hard . what kind of stuff are you doing to try and avoid that outcome ?
well , at the time i was holding out for a similar paying job like i had before but i could not find one and i ended up working fast food . i had to downs ##ize my place as well .

bum ##mer ! ! ! are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job ?
i hear ya . . i hope you find one soon . . . wishing you all of the best !
i do that all of time .
lo ##l . poor max . i bet sometimes dogs wished the spoke english for that very reason .
shame on you . i ' m telling
o wow that is a long time , are you happy with it ?
im sorry to hear that sometimes people grow apart . you should try to throw a party and see who comes .
congratulations ! i know , it probably feels lonely . maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours
you can ' t go wrong with some grille ##d food : ) burger ##s , wings , hot dogs
i would have went running like forest gum ##p - what did you do ?
going to have to burn the whole house down now , and move . . . lo ##l just joking !
oh no . did they say why ?
hopefully it might be rec ##ons ##ider ##ed later on .
is she ok ? im glad you were close by !
that is really cool of you to do , did anyone else see it happen ?
that ' s terrible . employers just don ' t value their employees sometimes .
i hope so , too . have you considered working elsewhere ?
oh no . . . were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem ?
well glad they didn ##t freak out on you , some people aren ##t as understanding . i bet it was price ##y .
why is that ?
well i just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good . maybe that will work for you .
that ' s good to hear . where did you get it from ?
i got ##cha . i bought mine online too .
oh no sorry to hear that . i just lost mine in november . it ' s hard .
people say it gets easier . i ' m still waiting for that part .
i hope so . nice chatting with you .
i hear ya . anyway to get a new job ?
got ya . what kind of work do you currently do ?
i don ##t like rude people either did you tell him ?
oh god . . give it a few days and then try to sort it out !
oh yeah i am sure it is . . have you talked to them about paying for it ?
that really sucks . . i guess all you can do is get a metal type of fence or maybe one with spikes ! ( lo ##l )
wow ! have you been to many places ?
i ' ve been in the same place . dc and then its neighbor , md .
my brothers are the same way . at least yours gina ##lly came around .
two younger ones . they only call when they want something . my older sister is the same . i ' m the good one .
happy birthday ! is the call from the ex a good or bad thing ?
ex ##es are ex ##es for a reason i guess lo ##l .
that ' s not good . i know my eyes hurt when staring at the bright white screen on computers . so i change them to a darker color when possible .
haven ' t tried that yet , but i have heard of it . i will check it out . thanks !

what happened to him ? how are they doing ?
that is under ##stan ##able , i would be the same way .
oh man . what happened ?
did you end up getting a ticket ?
that is a nice thing you are doing for her though . maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class .
go to a walking path or park . maybe to a dog park also .
can ' t always help unfortunately . i hope the little guy made it , too !
i wonder how they get all the way to the road away from the other turtles !
i am sorry to hear that . . is there any physical therapy that can help her ?
usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation . . . i would get a 2nd opinion !
how many hours do you have left ?
ha ##ha not bad ! where are you going on vacation ?
that ##s great , was the result good ?
that ' s great . how happy were you ?
did it bite you ? are you ok ?
im glad you are ok . some of those are poisonous and can kill .

very inspirational story . they make good money too .
that ' s amazing ! how do you anti ##ci ##pate dealing with people who are afraid of needles ?

that ' s really sweet of them . must ' ve been a big party .
that ##s so terrible ! : ( im really sorry . . . you should do something special everyday and make memories !
it really doesn ##t . . i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful . i really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon . .
did you tell your spouse ? i really think they should know .
some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them .
i know what you mean . . . but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one !
so you can ride in style for free . sounds fair to me . . until you get yours ! : )
oh no . i ' m sorry to hear that .
i don ' t . my apartment won ' t allow , but we are moving soon i hope to get a cat .
oh , i bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too .
i like to try different types of food from other places too . then try to make them later on .
that can be stress ##ful . i hope you get the sale . what will you do afterwards ?
do you prefer the isolation ?
awesome ! where are you headed to ?
om ##g ! ! ! ! ! that sounds amazing ! its going to be epic . i hope you have a great time .
that ' s really consider ##ate of you . do they need your help a lot ?
wow . home selling can be tough . i hope that debt clears up real soon !

i would be so scared to move to a new place . i com ##men ##d you . it ' ll get better
what happened ? !
oh no . did you end up having to leave the cart ?

i have no idea what that is .

what were you gonna do if you caught him ?
oh no ! were there a lot of lines you had to remember ?
oh wow , that ##s impressive but i don ' t blame you for forgetting lines then since there were probably tons .
wow ! have you looked to see how much it is worth ? you could have some money .
you might want to talk to a financial adviser about it .
did you find it ?
i ' m sure everyone has lost something . they ' re just probably glad it wasn ' t them .
that ' s awesome . do you think you will get it ?
yes , definitely . do you plan on buying anything new ?
what did you think about ?
glad to hear you had such a care ##free childhood . do you have siblings ?

i feel your pain , that happened to me a few years ago , i ended up having to settle on a job i didn ' t like just to make ends meet .
i hope you find a job , good luck !
i ' m doing pretty alright , what about you ?
absolutely , it is one of my biggest pet pee ##ves , especially when people accuse me of lying too .
i really wish i could not co ##rre ##late to that . but i can . me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face . it is a terrible feeling , and i know exactly what you are talking about . if it occurs a lot more i suggest you saying something about it , better to know the truth than dwell on it every ##time .
ye ##a , recently i have been trying to decide whether or not i want to mute my girlfriend on social media or not , like not block her , just mute her . because it bother ##s me how she acts single on social media , and it confuse ##s me as to whether she wants to be with me , or is just trying to live a different personality online . because she talks to me and is all love ##y - dove ##y , then gets on social media and talks like " i don ' t need anyone " and talks about how hot guys are . and it leaves me so stuck and with the worst anxiety .
was your history test hard even after all the studying ?
that ' s good , did you end up passing then ?
that ##s great . where did you meet ?
what did you eat ?
oh you were ? i really am not a huge sports fan , so what was so big about this ?
never once ? damn , no wonder you were so shocked by it !
yes , when does the season start ?
that ' s exciting , who ' s your favorite team ?
do you regret it now that you are ?
why are you worried still ?
oh no . how long has she been gone .
i hope not . my friends cat left for two weeks once . she came back hungry , but she was fine .
well i hope your cat returns safely .
you too
can you do any work to it . i know there are a lot ideas on pin ##ter ##est to per ##k up a place .
keep on the lookout and talk to real ##tors . they usually hear of good places first
how was it ?
that ##s great . where did you go .
i worry about that too occasionally , but i just push it to the back of my mind like usual .
i ' m sure it won ' t be , most people die of old age around their friends and family in a peaceful way so just hope for that .
i am , i like the oilers , who ' s your favorite team ?
nice , i hope they do well this season .
oh , all kids are a little if ##fy , i think . are you a teacher or do you mean your own children ?
teenagers are awful ! i am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager . . . . not .
my mom put " the curse " on me . she said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than i did . if that ' s the case , i need to start saving for boarding school , because i was awful !
good luck !
so is it working now ? i need at ##ran ##sm ##iss ##ion for an old volvo . i ' m saving for a new car instead .
makes sense . i don ' t want any more bills until my kids are in school . day ##care is very expensive .
of course the 13 year old hates to baby ##sit . i can ' t wait until she moves out . j ##k
this was the most fun chat iv ##e had today . enjoy yu ##r day !
what is hell ##p ? i ' m sorry you and your baby had to go through that .
that ' s terrible . there are so many things to be afraid of when you ' re pregnant !
i absolutely hate car issues . will you be getting it fixed or buying another one ?
did it have any warrant ##y when you bought it ?
why are you alone so much in the summer ?
do you have friends around ? go to a bar and meet some friends !
was it as you remembered it ?
that is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled . they seem to throw way too many buildings away these days .
i know that feeling too , at least somewhat . seems like clear favor ##itis ##m to me , but maybe i ' m wrong .
that type of stuff always makes me so angry , since it ' s so clearly favor ##itis ##m and h ##yp ##oc ##ris ##y and they just don ' t care one bit .
i like football , who are you talking about ? what team ?
oh i see ! are you excited with him ? do you think they can go for the super bowl ?
i know that feeling ! are you involved in any political or activists groups ?
me neither . but i agree with your sentiment - it is a great place to live and be a part of !
yes . i do not have any kids myself .
yes . grand ##ki ##ds would be fun .
oh no . did you get rid of the evidence ?
who ' s cookies were they ?
do you study ?
that ##s good . where do you go ?
interviews can be nerve wreck ##ing .
i think if you stay calm you ' ll do fine .
yi ##kes , that must of been a bit scary . how did it go ?
that ' s something at least . i hope they catch him .
yeah , i have a friend who has gone through the same situation . she just wants what ##s best best for her kids . i hope things get better for you .
it shouldn ' t matter what you look like , but why would you think you are fat ?
it doesn ' t mean you are fat or over ##weight . everyone is different .
i watch it sometimes , it can be a little slow moving for my taste .
are you from new york area . i ' m a little farther south , but i do like them for sure .
i hate jury duty .
yes . they under ##pa ##y .
yes , so are you having nice weather , or is it too dry and need some rain ?
i see . well , maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future ? i like sunshine , but know we need some rain too , hope you get some soon .
oh no ! that ' s scary ! the house didn ' t get flooded , right ?
i ' m sorry to hear that !
that ' s actually so frustrating ! no note left on your car or anything from the other driver ?
sorry to hear , i really hope that it doesn ' t cost to much to fix that up .
oh no , that really sucks . that ' s awful that she wanted to end things , especially since you were really into her . i am sorry .
that ' s really odd , and unfortunate . thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better : ) don ' t lose hope !
that ##s sound nice . i went on vacation to thailand last week . what did you do ?
i know what that feels like . it must have been exciting !
acting as a ' mentor ' in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better !
oh no , was it an important meal ?
that ' s so sad ! what did you end up doing instead ?
what went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make ?
yes airplanes make me feel que ##as ##y too . what do you do to cope with it ?
i am sorry to hear that . flying is never easy , especially when you feel that stressed
who is she ?
that is bad . did you bought her a good present so she can forget about it ?
that does sound scary ! were you okay ?
understand ##able , it must have been very unexpected !
that can be a fun time , it is nice to watch kids sometimes
i love playing video games , i am sure he really enjoyed that , even i would have !
nice , i am glad to hear about that
how old is he ?
wow , that ' s terrible . why would he do that to you ?
i ' m sorry you ' re having to go through that , i hope you ' re able to sell the home for a better price .
that ' s just terrible . some people really are un ##grate ##ful .
well , hopefully he ' ll learn to be a better person someday , or eventually his actions will come back to haunt him .
i know that feel , my brother graduated a year ago , it ' s a really big milestone .
yes i agree , it really signifies the start of their next chapter in life .
that must have been a burden lifted for sure !
that must have been a burden lifted for sure !
that ' s a shame , since rain is really nice to watch and hear even disregard ##ing the dry ##ness over there .
very true , well hopefully you get some anyway !
that ' s usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem in ones self i believe .
i hope you he changes some so you can still be friends .
that ' s wonderful ! i ' ve never cheated on my husband either
it is : ( i don ' t know how is it possible to cheat on someone you love
i am sure you can , it just takes dedication and effort is all !
then you should have no problems at all !
that is so scary ! you didn ' t get hurt , right ?
i ' m so glad you did ' nt get hurt
i was also excited . in fact , i have one right now !
those are great titles . i am a big nintendo fan . i can ' t wait for the new metro ##id prime .
that should be fun . pokemon is a great franchise . i have many of the handheld games .
i have not , i did hear that england lost recently though .
i heard they were doing great before the loss though , hope you at least got to see them in some good matches .
oh no , sorry to hear that ! were you okay ?
i can imagine . well at ##lea ##st you can look back and laugh it off as one of ' those ' days !
did this make you excited ?
what type of car was it ?
i am sorry to hear that , maybe things will work themselves out !
i feel bad , i hope you find someone who treats you even better !
that sounds embarrassing , what happened after ?
that sounds like what i would have done too
what a jerk . did you let him know he was being rude ?
hat a jerk . did you let him know he was being rude ?
you should let him know now .
i loved my grandparents on my mother ' s side , so i understand how you feel .
i was very close to mine . they are like parents but more fun .
that is scary , what are you going to do about it ?
wow that is sad , i hope you get that fixed
that ' s fun , my friend is getting married next year , how big was the wedding ?
oh i see , well that ' s still nice !
that is very sad , did he ever get sober ?
that is so great , i hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger .
wow , that ' s quite a move . did he say why he ' s staying in samoa so long ?
i can understand that . it ' s hard to say goodbye to a friend , i hope you can stay in contact with him .
oh man that ' s a bad situation . was this vase of any sentimental value , or was it really expensive or what ?
that might be a good idea , even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt .
wow that is terrible , i hope he got to live a long life before that happened .
that ##s terrible , at least he wasn ##t a puppy i guess .
i can imagine you would be , wouldn ##t want that to happen again .
crazy they won ##t even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison .
how did he manage to do that ?
i mean you said he barely passed it though . must have been slim picking ##s when it came to giving out the sho ##lars ##hips .
what college did he end up going to ?
ah , yes , the lucrative writing career .
did you get it done ?
oh , nicely done , that ##s impressive !
that is really awful . did they take very much ?
i bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal . friends should be more trust ##worthy .
oh no , did it end up okay ?
i ' m glad to hear it turned out okay .
wow , it ' s a wound ##er you did not get killed !
do you have any lasting damage ?
i was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks . so i know how it is .
it would have been easier to room with your brother isn ##tead of a random room ##ate , i bet .
strange they ask you to pay for college , but offer few choices .
that ' s great ! that time with the kids will really be worth it , ultimately .
yeah , it ' s a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now .
i did too , honestly . i have really improved them myself , good to hear that you have too .
although i still deal with stress occasionally , i know exactly what you mean .
why were you nervous about it ? usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun .
i can see that , i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age .
i totally understand . but i guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too
remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything . being with someone isn ' t everything , be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it : )
i bet so . i ' ve never done anything like that before .
that is surprising . usually these things are a popularity contest .
i would not , they have to learn at some point !
i get that , but it was bound to ha ##pp ##n at some point
you must have been thrilled ! there is nothing like a first car . did you love it ?
no way - - that ' s the best . paid for ( i ' m assuming ) * and * running . do you hope to do the same for your kids when it ' s time ?
damn , i wish i had a car myself . what was the occasion ?
cool , 16th birthday or what ?
what did you do ?
that was the right move !
that ' s impressive , sounds like a smart young man .
sounds like it , good for you guys !
ah ##h yes , must have been a very nice surprise ! did you play mario on it ?
well that ##s one way to get your kids to do household chores !
what athletics did you participate in ?
man i know that feeling . but sounds like you worked hard .
when did he graduate ? sounds like a really cool moment to share with him .
i graduated that year too ! cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was .
i am very sorry to hear that , that must be terrible . . . .
i under ##tan ##d that . people are crazy like that , i never understood it
that is something i want to do when i get older , i miss the golden days !
i bet it was , to catch up after awhile , few things really compare
that ' s tragic , i haven ' t had to deal with anything like that yet .
i hope so too , and i hope that you don ' t have to deal with anything like that anytime soon .
so your saying your faithful and love her .
sounds like you got your priorities straight good man .
wow , go you ! i am proud of you , it can be tough to do !
that is what matters , best of luck using it friend !
that is an amazing thing . being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship .
i am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she rec ##ip ##ro ##cate ##s your desire to never cheat .
how exciting , are you from france ?
when did she move out there ?
great . how long did you stop working out ?
it is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out .
was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65 ?
the question is , did the woman at least do a good job ( from what you could see ) ?
how did you respond after rejection ?
yes , you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise
i am sorry to hear that , i hope things turn around for you soon !
i am glad to hear that , i hope they work out for you !
ha ##ha what kind of food did they leave for you ? did you say anything to them ?
lo ##l it really shouldn ' t be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh ! i guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around ! ha ##ha
om ##g congratulations ! that ##s a great achievement and must give you so much pride and mo ##tica ##tion for the future
all the best for your future and your role as ##well !
you are right . florida is a big state with lot ' s of people .
the odds must be astronomical , almost like winning the lottery .
i am shocked too , croatia only has 4 mill ##io people
ye ##aa ##h they really were , number 12 killed it with that goal
i feel that man , parents like that care for their family a lot .
i am in that boat at times where i live .
i know that feeling , good for you !
yes , those are awesome feelings , i cr ##ave that all the time
well he did have a right to be angry ( depending on how you broke it of ##c )
oh dar ##n that ##s just ab ##it rude and unnecessary . i hope everything is ok now
i am glad to hear that , did you repay him ?
that is good to hear , i am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster
sibling fights worth living for . . i wish i had one .
you would know better he ##he ! !
well happy early birthday ! i hope you have a great day !
i bet , i hope you get everything you want !
sorry to hear that . do you have more fire ##nds now ?
great .
good job ! i am sure that took a lot of hard work !
i am sure that was stress ##ful that whole time
what is it about their style of play that you ' re not a fan of ?
i see where you ' re coming from .
i ' m not too familiar with tennis , is he known to be a winner ?
wow that ' s neat ! crazy to hear he lost then as you said .
what exciting news ! did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was ?
what is 2000 yen equal to in u . s . currency ?
it sure sounds like it . i think healthcare in japan is much more affordable that here in america , do you agree ?
oh , okay , well i watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries . i understand that doesn ' t apply here .
mom ##s are good at doing that , aren ' t they ? what did she do for you ?
i know that feeling ! what ' s been getting to you ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you make a speedy recovery !
yes , especially if you travel a lot and for a long time . is it for work ?
where do you go the most ?
that is nice ! i wish i can go to those countries
wow ! that sound ' s really awesome . i wish i could have gone there . but surely not for work !
i wish you all the best pal ! you will surely rock !
maybe something in your life makes you very stress . you should try to relax before go to sleep .
you ko ##n ##w , sometimes consulting a ps ##y is a good investment . don ##t be afraid to do that .
that sounds very sad . i am very sorry to hear you experienced that .
huh , i see . well good for him !
what happened ?
oh , no . that ' s awful ! did you report something that had occurred at your job ?
yeah , that ' s good . it ' s hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes . it could always come back for you . i ' m glad that it sounds like it worked out .
yeah , na ##vi ##gating those sorts of things is treacherous , but as long as you know you ' re doing the right thing , that ' s all you can do .
that can be pretty hard to swallow , do you stay in touch ? it ' s easier these days with the likes of social media . how do you fill that void ?
that ' s such a shame , we gr ##ie ##ve any kind of loss , i suppose . perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together ?
i hope it works out for you , life is too short . fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen .
i ' m not actually much of a soccer fan but the h ##ype is hard to escape !
yes , i ' m aware , but i ' m a much bigger hockey fan .
i stand behind him . compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a mexican american .
how so because i want everyone in this place to be safe ? you need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here .
it ' s sad that you have such a small mind .
it does happen sometimes . has it ever occurred to you ?
you must have felt terribly guilty when you realized ! happens to all of us
brain just wants to work against you ?
i would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it ' s pretty normal to have those moments .
oh , man . that ' s rough . i ' m sorry . are friends helping ?
friends i know who have been through rough breakup ##s often say that physical activity helps . that , and time . but still - - it ' s difficult !
holy smoke ##s - that ##s unbelievable . i gave up on playing those scratch off games
how often do you play ?
were you using it to get to a specific place ?
i hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going .
i am hopeful as well , but because we are human beings , i doubt that will ever happen . there will always be the same old sq ##ua ##bble ##s that have occurred since the dawn of man .
yeah , sadly our world leaders are too focused on " flex ##ing " instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and live ##able for our grandchildren ' s children
that ' s sad . sorry you had to go through that .
i would have pee ##d in my pants if i was there .
how do you feel now after so long being there ?
that is a great feeling i bet ! good job man !
that must have been terrible . were you okay ?
i can imagine it must have been very distress ##ing . glad that you were ok .
yes , many . would you like to tell me about it ?
surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control .
that is terrible . were you able to do anything about it ?
did you speak to a counselor , priest , or family member about it ?
that is terrible . did you feel lonely ?
how long did you stay alone ?
that is pretty great ! i am actually still a begin ##ner with snow ##boarding .
i feel for me it ' s just getting to the slopes more often too .
true ! conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up
do you have a professional degree in first aid ?
texas does that to us ! it helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm . or do you like spending time out in the heat ?
i know what you mean . it ' s like you have to dress for both the outside * and * the inside . that ' s great you have a pool in which to escape , though !
oh no ! hopefully rent ##ers insurance covered it !
well that is terrible for him but i am glad at least some of it is being taken care of !
u ##gg i am sorry to hear that . sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business .
were they fond memories ?
that ' s understand ##able . i hope everyone you know is doing well from back then !
oh wow that sounds awful ! was it graphic ?
i ' m so sorry you had to go through that .
sorry to hear about that . did you ask him to move out of the house ?
did you know the person who was with him ?
what song was it ? did you know it ?
man that is crazy ! especially that song !
i consider myself somewhat know ##led ##ga ##ble about them too , it ' s very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes .
yeah , sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves .
did you take that chance and red ##o it ?
i hope the email will bring you good news
i know that pain ! did he keep you up watching tv or video games ?
because mine does the same thing . . . if its not video games its the tv on full blast ha ##ha ! tell him you need your beauty sleep .
so have you gotten to open it yet ? ?
wow ! i would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that .
oh no ! well what he didn ' t know won ' t hurt him . hopefully you can get a replacement .
aw ##w ##w well i am glad he was understanding about it .
that ##s unfortunate . it is a difficult decision to make . sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us .
i hope he is in a better place now . how did you have black ##jack for ?
so you all had relatively all his life . yes , it was the right thing to do . did you get another pet instead ?
wow ! you must have a very trusting face ! that was very nice of you to help her .
it definitely was ! how old do you think her kids were ?
i almost don ' t want to talk about it , you know ? are you doing anything to try to move from a place of fear to one of preparation or opportunity ?
good for you . and i hope you have moments of joy while you prepare for that ?
did you play it ?
that sounds so fun ! i " m glad you enjoyed it !
i imagine that made you feel em ##path ##etic to his plight .
please tell me that you gave him some money to help him out .
that ' s unfortunate . do you like her ?
i am sorry . did you set up another day to hang out ?
what did you and your friends do on that day ?
that does sound fun ! was the food good ?
oh no , did you report it to the police ?
i have some hot chocolate that can help calm you down a bit .
no ! that is painful ! he must have felt awful ! did he have insurance to cover anything ?
i am so sorry ! but he does sound like a true friend if he ' s actively paying you back !
that is exciting when your team wins , have you always been a hockey fan ?
that is awesome ! i am from chicago , so when the cubs won the world series i felt the same way .
i bet ! always good when new life is born .
oh that must be a handful for your parents .
i am sorry to hear that . i hope she gets better .
that is horrible news . your family should make sure she gets comfortable on her last moments .
wow i did not know that !
oh no . were you upset as well ?
of course ! i ' m human ! ; - ) beyond the disappointment ##s , i think it ' s how we respond that defines us , you know ?
probably even harder ! is there another fellowship you have your eye on ?
oh , sending you all the best vibe ##s ! and congratulations ahead of time , doctor !
oh really ? how did that make you feel , honestly ?
i can imagine . the unknown can be very scary and make you worry .
oh no ! was it a first date ? or had you been out with this person before ?
that ' s so sweet . do you laugh about the situation now together ?
that ' s really awesome , what makes it so complex ?
well that ' s really great that you were able to prepare so much , obviously you know what you ' re doing ! do you usually have to prep so much ?
aw ##w ! that ' s so sweet ! how long have you been married ?
that ' s very exciting ! congratulations on your raise !
please tell me you caught him ! ! that is awful ! !
you almost gave me a heart attack with that story ! !
that was very nice of them . was it for a special occasion ?
well , now you know they do ! that was very thoughtful of them .
where did you see it ?
i bet , what did it look like ?
what made it so difficult ?
did you tell the teacher then we know at ##lea ##st you had tried .
wonderful ! your team i guess ? that ' s exciting !
it ' s great you give them the respect for that , your team or not ! when is the final ?
what is it about ?
sounds like you will likely do well . do you expect any problems with other people ?
that ' s so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you . i wish i could do that .
you ' re right , and i do all of the time . what kind of car did you get ?
i remember those cars ! how long did it last you ?
that is such a stress ##ful thing to come home to !
i am so sorry you had to go through that !
oh how nice ! did you get to visit with friends and family ?
i ' ll bet . it ' s always nice to visit , but it can be hard to say goodbye .
you still remember what you got for it ? it must have been memorable ! what was it ?
oh i know that feeling ! my family was the same way , and i still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same s ##nes box sitting on my bed .
oh wow , what time did you end up getting to bed ?
i know the feeling too well ! hopefully you get a good ' s night rest tonight .
you shouldn ' t think about death ! take each day as it comes
thinking like that seems stress ##ful
life is like that . it is not what you know but who you know .
no need to kiss butt . maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it ' s terms .
what battle ? what were you doing ?
is that a video game ?
that ' s never fun . did you have any notes to help you remember ?
that wasn ' t very nice of them . it ' s quite common to forget things . hopefully next time you remember !
wow , i ' m sure it will work . i ' ve very hopeful for you .
my wife and i have been together for 12 years , tried years ago and nothing . waited a while and then started trying again and we got it . fate has a funny way of working out .
that is great . with who are you going ?
that is great .
wow . what do you think will happen ?
well make sure you listen to your dr . ' s advice !
congratulations ! ! ! that can be both exciting and terrifying ? where are you on that spectrum ? ; - )
i am sending you all the best vibe ##s . is it in a field you ' ve worked in before ?
happily , a lot of employers seem to be willing to extra ##pol ##ate that if you had talents in one industry , they ' d apply to another . you can always learn about different subjects ; you can ' t always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs . best of luck !
i ' ve been in that boat . what do you think the issue was ?
that stink ##s . i ' ve been interviewing also . i had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer . so i feel ya . just keep looking .
how did that go ?
was it a long move ?
why didn ' t you have any friends ?
what games did you play at the time ?
sorry to hear that , what happened ?
that ' s awful , people need to be more careful
did you tell him , or did he find out ?
awe , i am sorry . in those instances , nobody wins . i hope you guys came out of it stronger than before
what was the team activity ?
i ' m happy it went well for you !
what is your health issue ?
sorry to hear that . i have same issues with my knees .
oh no , were you able to tell her you did it ?
u ##gh , i ' m sure that was hard . i ' m sorry you had to go through that .
i so agree . i would not want to live like that . and it ' s one thing if they ' re only affecting themselves - - but when it ' s aimed at others - - the worst .
isn ' t that weird ? i mean it takes * energy * to be that negative ! does your brother feel that too ? or just can ' t / won ' t see it ?
how is she feeling ?
that ' s terrific . hopefully she continues to get better and better .
how did that make you feel
did you confront him
oh i am sorry to hear that . how ?
oh no ! i hope you can fix it !
i remember those days , what subject ?
it sounds hard ! what grade did you get ?
i have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000 ' s . being an adult is no fun .
yes or rich . when i was a kid i wanted to grow up . now that i ' m old i want to be a kid again .
did you decline ? i would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family .
i agree , you made the right choice . and it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleep ##over !
oh , well that isn ' t fair of your boss ! most people wouldn ' t work at all while are maternity leave , he should be grateful !
well , sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you ! maybe he needs a long break !
do you mean le ##bron james ? i was hoping he ' d come to miami !
i wish he would have ! the heat can use his help ! ha ##ha !
that must ' ve been awesome . i ' ve only been to one nfl game and it was wild !
i can imagine ! i remember finding out i got free tickets to disney world one time , i was ec ##static .
wow i am so sorry . that had to be so scary . were the cops able to find any evidence ?
man i was hoping they would be able to help in some way ! i hope they didn ' t take anything to personal !
how sweet ! how old are they now ?
this is true for me as well , i have a 17 and 19 years old . i can ' t believe it , and just turned 40 on the 5th .
that ' s . . intriguing . is there any particular reason why you ' re scared of the ocean ?
really ? same . . i was about 5 in the deep end by myself . how old were you ?
i do not like ok ##cup ##id .
i prefer tin ##der .
i wish i was chris pratt but why do you wanna be " the pitt "
this is very true , but would you want to be bug ##ged by people all the time .
i love pokemon .
cool . i liked pokemon blue .
why do you fail ? do you not study ?
no one is smart until they learn to be smart . we are all born with brains but not smart ##s . we must gain smart ##s .
you can be the next trump if you work hard .
you have to work hard and get good at some ##ht ##ing .
i ' m sorry to hear that . you two were close ?
i did the same with mine . i lived with her during the summers and went home when school started back .
hey , it happens sometimes . what was the situation ?
trust me i ' ve been there ! some days are better than others . did you apologize ?
i know that must have been so disappointing !
well there will always be other chances for this match up to play out again .
i ' m sorry to hear that . it must be difficult to be away from the one you love .
i ' m glad to hear that . i wish you continued love and success with your marriage . it ' s a rare gift to have these days .
does he have good characteristics too , or is he just annoying all the time ?
does he at least have interesting things to say when he talks ?

i can totally relate . dogs are better than most people . what kid of dog was it ?

thank goodness she was able to come , but that must have been so scary ! i hope you ' re okay now !
i ' ve been there when a new company bought us out . how did you handle it ?
that sounds stress ##ful . at least they offered se ##verance .
emotions run high - we all say things we don ' t mean . what happened ?
honestly , you got to pick one or the other . i can see how you were frustrated , but i ' m glad you realize you shouldn ' t have yelled .
why is that ? is there something wrong with you ?
you should work on that . be a better version of yourself .
i love donald trump .
no , he lowered my taxes .
my husband has that issue . are you shorter than average ?
i ' ve heard of people trying to hang upside down for hours a day to length ##en themselves . not that i think it works , but apparently many people would like to be taller .

i am a male .
i am filipino also .

well , i can ' t relate to some extent . my father passed away 2 years unexpectedly . it wasn ' t from cancer , and we actually never thought he was going to pass away that day when he went to the hospital . but , it ' s very hard to lose loved ones !
yes , i love new ga ##dgets . specially from the apple store .
i remember also playing games with old and slow computers when i was a teenager .
was it the summer flu ? heard that went around a lot .
that just sounds so bad . glad she is better now !
why ? you should be happy with who you are .
height you can not change but if you work hard anyone can be rich .
just work hard and make your own money .
i ' m sure you will . have you been training ?
do you think that ' s enough ?
i ' m so sorry . that must have been so painful for you . were you close ?
my heart hurts for you . that ' s such a terrible loss .
is it ok ?
i do not like salesman .
i don ' t think there is anything wrong with average .
we are all average until circumstances require us to be extraordinary .
i saw that movie a long time ago .
what was your favorite part
cool , i guess she was strong .
do you have any kids ?
i do not , how about you ?
that ##s cool , what kind of camera do you have ?
that is an awesome achievement ! was it for high school or college ?
i never played any sports in high school , i always had to work . that is a great accomplishment !
yi ##kes , door guy can ' t catch a break . is he ok ?
wow , thank god he ' s on the up and up . i can ' t imagine how rough that must have been .
man i feel you . today was her birthday . . but i thought it would be awkward to go over since she blocked me on facebook
where are you from originally . i ' m filipino
i have not and don ' t want to .
i do like a good sandwich thou . but i eat slow .
awe , i am sorry for your loss . was it sudden ?
i am sorry for the loss . are you okay ?

bum ##mer . haven ' t seen it . don ' t watch soccer but i respect the sport
wow , you are lucky you did not die .
did someone save you ?
why ? she seems to be nice person
oh i didn ' t know about that . how she is able to steal money ?
that is great .
hopefully it will work out .
good for you . what is the reason of all this happiness ?
you choose the best time . the summer is perfect for beaches .
yes . they should of won .
yes but the choked like usual .
i would be as well if i were you . are you from the area ?
wasn ' t johnny man ##zie ##l su ##sp ##osed to save that team ?
i ' m not a big fan of them either . are you able to go up in buildings with an elevator , etc . . ?
has it ever caused you to not be able to enjoy certain things in life ?
were the results good or bad ?
yes i am sure it was .
aw ##w he must be adorable .
ha ##ha ##h how old is he ? !
oh , that is exciting . how big is your house ?
oh , that sounds nice . what ' s your occupation ?
wow that ' s pretty bad parenting .
is it for religious reasons
hind ##sight and all that - do you miss her ?
perhaps she may forgive you ? it ' s always worth a try , sometimes you just need some time and some growth before you can rev ##isi ##t mistakes that have happened .
what are your plans ?
wow , that sounds like a fun and interesting time , but it sounds like there are a high chance for things to go south and be a huge mess
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . how dei ##d it happen ?
are you going to sue ? you could get a whole new leg !
how much would you like to lose ?
sounds like a plan ! you can also try to see if there is less cal ##ori ##e version of foods you like .
i know how that can be such a struggle . how long has it been and why did it end ?
everyone makes mistakes , we live and learn i guess . if there is no hope of her taking you back , then you have to find a way to move forward , but take the time you need to gr ##ie ##ve as it is a loss .
nice ! does he feel pretty confident about it
awesome ! glad it worked out for him
yes i have actually . it was scary .
im so sorry to hear that . i was watching a house for a fa ##mi ##lty member and they ' re safe was stolen .
i love the beach , the gulf is my favorite !
the atlantic is not so bad !
sorry to hear that . my grandmother is all i have left . grandpa passed 1 month ago
how old are your daughters
wow - were you nervous or scared at all ? did the police get involved ?
oh no ! did you have to go to the hospital to get stitches or anything like that ?
that is fun ! what was it ?
what a neat mystery . i bet you wish you could thank them though .
oh no i ' m sorry about that , do you have any family that can help ?
do you have any leads on any new jobs ?
oh no . did you talk it out with them ?
that ' s nice . everyone makes mistakes . glad he was for ##giving !
that was noble
i guess when you do that well in school , you can afford to miss a day because of that every once and awhile
that is an awesome dad . do you still have the truck ?
a decade is great use of it . do you miss it ?
oh , that is so hard . it sounds like she had a long and happy life . i ' m sure you miss her so much .
what kind of dog was she ?
oh no ! is she okay ?
that ' s good to hear ! how long ago was that ?
so i take it you are a soccer fan ? it seems america is finally getting into the sport . do you play yourself ?
i would imagine so ! argentina seems like a lovely place to live .
oh , wa ##o those a terrible news , is there any way to keep the house ?
well , you have to weight your financial situation vs your emotional situation and see if it worth to keep the house , i guess you have so many memories there .
all of y ' all must have been so scared ! was she okay ? any stitches necessary ?
the vomiting is scary - - so good that y ' all got to the er , and could confirm that she was okay . was she fearful of stairs after that ?
i ' m glad you had someone to take care of it while you were away . was you mother alright ?
oh no . were you able to get things sorted out ? we live far away from family and i know how hard it can be especially when there are health concerns .
ah , congratulations ! what a great feeling . are y ' all all still good friends ?
you know what , nothing to mo ##urn , really . life has chapters , you know ? it ' s wonderful you have the memories you do .
i watched a movie based off a true story on that once . it was true ##ly a sad story for the little girl and her parents .
it was a korean movie . don ' t recall the name .
that ' s pretty sympathetic of you . . . but aren ' t you worried they ' ll start going through your trash
do you own any cats or dogs
wow , i ' ll bet you ' re ready for a vacation . are you going anywhere special ?
that should be awesome . do you know anyone in canada ?
it sounds beautiful and serene .
no i haven ' t . but now i want to see .
what an amazing gift to be given ! that truly sounds like a blessing for you .
for sure ! did you accept the gift ?
i ' m glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that !
what do you say to your kids to deal with it ?
that ##s awesome , congratulations for sure
i am sure you are both going to be happy
wow . what a mature teacher .
was the fire related to the incident or did she get in trouble for something else ?
that is great ! have you been looking for a job for long ?
i bet it is a good feeling and are looking forward to hearing from them .
sorry to hear about your other ones . . . what breed is the new one

was he okay with the happy meal ?
that ' s good to hear !
oh , no ! i ; m sorry to hear that . is this normal for your friend .
i hope that you hear from him soon !
wow that is super scary ! are you ok ?
sometimes i keep a extra pi ##r of underwear in my car for this occasion .
me too , i haven ' t really found a good strategy to avoid the nervous ##ness to be honest .
yeah the more you think about it the more you let your expectations and imagination ##s put fear into you , guess we have to avoid doing that somehow .
oh man , i accidentally eat cake all the time ! it is too hard to resist . what did your mom do ?
that is not too bad . what kind of cake was it ?
wow . the d ##m ##v is just dreadful to go to because of stuff like that .
ye ##a , it would be ! how fa ##w is your d ##m ##v ?
wow , that is awesome ! bet you were shocked and happy at the same time !
i bet ! especially with the cost of college these days !
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that . was he adopted ?
oh no . poor guy . i hope he ' ll be happy with the man .
oh nice did you have fun ? what lake ?
what did you guys do there today ? go swimming or fishing ?
the d ##m ##v really should be better by now . did you get a chance to do anything during the wait ?
wow . just one inc ##on ##ven ##iec ##e after another . it ' s no wonder people dread having to deal with the d ##m ##v .
awesome ! it seems like you really worked hard , what type of work do you do ?
oh , yeah . i couldn ' t do that type of work . it is too stress ##ful for me .
that is so hard , to feel like you ' ve been looked over . have you been able to have conversations with leadership as to why that might be the case ?
does that make you curious to look elsewhere ? it sounds like it ' s maybe not the best place ?
oh no . what happened ?
wow . it had that much of an effect on you ? that it made you consider your own mortality ?
well it ' s good to remember your mortality , even if you have to ignore it to continue normal life .
i am so sorry for you . i know what a crushing experience the passing of a beloved pet can be . you must be very sad .
that is awful . an unexpected illness cam really strike like a dagger in the heart .
what concert ? did you like her enough to go on a 2nd date ?
well , that sounds a bit scary ! what happened ?
did he pass away or not live close to you ?
i ' m so sorry , it ' s hard when anyone close passes on , but i think parents are one of the hardest .
why did you decide to change their education ?
that is an important steep you are taking in your life .
how come ?
that ' s a tough decision to make , but children do need someone at that young an age .
how do you feel about that ?
that is a tough situation . you don ' t want to mess up a great friendship and you also don ' t want to hurt her feelings either if you don ' t feel the same .
why are you jealous of eric ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , i know what it ' s like to have your love stolen from you .
if that ' s the case then you have a chance to find a better woman !
maybe he has no respect for you .
have you try talk to him about those issues . if he likes you he should work on the relationship .
awesome ! what type of promotion ? did you get a raise too ?
cong ##rat ##s for what store or company ? did you get a raise too ?
uh ##mm ##nn ##n , that could have been really emotional for you
i understand , i ' ve been there too , hope your getting through ?

my oldest only has 3 years to go and i already have dogs ! i guess i ' ll need more
wow that really old but not too old for mum ##mies considering .
ha ##ha ye ##a seems like it would be really cool to see in person .
what did your friend say ?
did you buy him more food ?
that ' s good . it sounds like a happy ending .
that must have been very frightening . did you have somewhere safe that you went to >
what are the chances of that ? ! how strange , but lucky for you .
what is happening on sunday ?
who are you pulling for ?
it ' s always good to see an under ##dog win !
what is happening in february ?
good for you . you are going to have the time of your life .
i ' m really sorry to hear that . when did she pass away ?
i ' m sure with time the pain will pass . try to stay positive !
oh my ! that is so scary . thank goodness you are ok . was it the uber driver ' s fault ?
absolutely . knock on wood , i ' ve still never been in a car crash . make sure you go to the doctor if you have any pain over the next couple of days .
where do you live ? i live in missouri and the snow ##s can be brutal . we had a couple days at 0 ##f this year . i hate it
i heard about that on the news , how it was rare to see that . i love georgia . my favorite place to visit is savannah . i will gladly trade spots with you .
my day was pretty good . i got to work from home and pack for my trip this weekend .
i am going to cal ##i to see all of the national parks .
i plan to go to both of those parks plus lake ta ##hoe and las vegas . i have never been to vegas .
that ' s pretty cool . what breed ?
well you picked a great one : ) love labs . my friend ' s got a big one he just attacks me with love every ##time i see him
that really sucks . i hate it when people spoil shows !
sometimes you just got to bing ##e on your own , lo ##l !
oh no . . that sounds awful . what happened next ?
that is ridiculous . no one should treat you like that when you ' re seeking medical help .
oh that is scary , that happened to us a couple months ago !
i suppose find the safe ##st spot to bunker down , it ' s hard not to panic though
i completely understand . i stay home with my four kids and wouldn ' t have it any other way .
yeah , i do them all here too , they are never ending .
yes it is : )
interesting ! did you app ##re ##hend him ?
i could imagine the experience . that was a wise thing you did !
i can ##t actually see what you put in the prompt , but man that ##s crazy if it was a ferrari .
i love ferrari ##s , they are so expensive though , one day i hope to own one .
me too , how does christmas in july work ?
maybe keep it simple , and do different things each year . last year we went on vacation .
awesome ! what are you studying ?
curves are always a good thing ! i was always thankful for them .
oh yeah ? what ' s so special about it ?
wow ! that sounds like such a fun time
never had children as in in ##fer ##tile or a bad person ?
that ##s terrible , i hope they grow up fine , would be ho ##rri ##d if they didn ##t .
oh no , are you ok ?
i can imagine , perhaps it ' s a good way to get someone to fix the steps ?
i am sorry to hear about that . what happened ?
i hope you have been able to cope . death is a very hard thing to overcome .
oh no , i hope your kid wasn ' t too upset . maybe need to lock the dog in another room when food is out .
well that ' s good they ya ##ll still had cake . i ' m sure you will laugh about this in the future .
oh that ##s sounds fun ! how much did it cost you ?
that ##s great . will you be camping in the mountains or a forest ##y place ?
i bet that was really exciting !
oh wow that does sound exciting ! are you still at this university ?
that is terrifying ! let me guess , they were on their phone ?
i would have been mad , too . people on their phones drive like drunk drivers . so dangerous .
i can imagine it was a great experience , not sure if i will ever have kids .
def ##int ##ely and im happy you went through with it after what i would assume was a long decision .
why did you make that choice ?
iv ' e never heard of ballet school being so intensive . is it something she ' s considering as a career ?
oh no , your cat fell out of the window ? is it ok ?
i guess what they say is true - cats do have nine lives .
did you think you did well ?
that ' s awesome ! it can be nerve rack ##ing
he should be there for you .
the best thing you can do is get ride of him .
he is not for everyone
there have been a lot of those in politics .
do you get to anxious about it ?
you should look for a therapy that will help you with this issue .
what are you feeling happy about ?
that ' s great . i ' m sure you will enjoy being with them
cheating on her ? i am in a relationship and not married , and i have the thought too
i understand that . i live by a college . all the insane ##ly cute girls are always around at every shop , rest ##ara ##unt , and bar .
sorry to hear that . how old is he / she
yes though it ' s something everyone goes through . . . especially if he ' s going to be a man . . i used to be the ne ##rdy fat asian kid who got picked on til i sucker punched the bully as hard as i could . . . and never got picked on again
wow , that is quite lucky for you ! i bet you made some good tips as well !
what let you on your career path to be a male strip ##per ? did you have a role model ?
i can imagine because becoming a mother was the best time in my life !
aw ##w , i feel like that with my kids ! they ' re always going to be my babies
how on earth did it get stuck ?
poor thing , did it need ot be helped ?
that is so sweet ! did he end up crying when he saw the puppy ?
i have a cat . her name is venus . i rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog .
thank you ! i am drawn to the stars and sky , and for some reason it just seemed so fitting . what was the puppy ' s name ?
that ' s an adorable name . did your brother name him ?
oh my ! i graduate this year in a short few months . i worked really hard .
i sure did . thanks i worked extremely hard !
are you referring to the 2018 games in asia ?
oh , so you ' re a soccer fan ? i don ' t really watch sports .
oh that ' s good you prepared but that ' s terrible timing !
it ' s good it ended up not being too bad , storms can be very unpredictable
that ' s the worst ! . mine was up extra late tonight too .
i know . we just read a bed ##time story where the mom paints a night scene on the child ' s blind to make her feel better .
i hear you ! i was college roommate ##s with my sister and now we live hours apart .
that is so awesome to hear . thanks to cars and everything an hour is nothing nowadays . especially when you can put portable dvd players in there for the kids !
awe , i bet you felt so proud and happy for them .
i know , they can be amazing when they are learning and exploring the world . . . however , i still don ' t think having a different colored cup than the one they wanted warrant ##s the response they tend to give . ( i have a 2 year old and a 3 year old son )
i agree . i am still trying to figure out why they fight so much over b ##lip ##pi and pep ##pa pig ! they are both horrible , just pick one and get it over with . i will be miserable through both , lo ##l
did she jumped really high or something ?
tt ##hat sounds like a lot of fun
oh i am sorry to hear that . are you doing okay ?
i am worried about you . i hope that you will have someone to talk to .
aw , i be so . how old is he ?
wow , congratulations ! that is such an accomplishment . he must be very bright
that is normal . we all get nervous on our fist day of work .
how are you doing on that job nowadays ?
i think so too ! i swear it was like 2012 yesterday .
that ' s insane . i heard that the older you are , the faster time goes by since the percentage of your life that a specific amount of time is gets shorter and shorter .
right ? i didn ' t think about that . i miss time passing by slowly and being so excited for everything .
i am sorry to hear that . are you doing better now ?
i like keeping busy too . it really helps me stay sane !
no way ! what happened . . . was there a confrontation ?
oh ok . i take it , he was " cat calling " ? there are class ##ier ways of app ##re ##cia ##ting art .
ha ##ha . well , who can judge art , right ?
that ' s pretty funny . did your sister ever find out it was you who took it ?
one time my cousins dog , ruby , almost bit me for trying to put away a bowl of food . so , i understand how dogs can be with food at times ha ##ha .
what would you have done in that situation ?
just be glad that everyone in your class probably has no memory of it now .
awe , i am sorry to hear that . do you think there will be any chance of a reconciliation ?
i know it isn ' t my place to ask , but why did they di ##so ##wn you ?
in the end , i hope she sees that you were able to make it work , and if you can and do , she should meet you half way . you are very welcome : )
yeah , i always hate ending conversations as well 2 turns just isn ' t enough . i will now let you end the conversation , lo ##l
serious ? don ' t you like pizza ?
so bad from the vendor
ha ##ha that is terrible ! unless he was hot . . .
well in his defense , it ' s pretty hot out .
oh really ? ! is she not afraid of the dentist ?
oh that ' s great ! sometimes it is just difficult to takes kids to the dentist .
you and the rest of the world , lo ##l . joking . joking . why are you furious ?
yes , that was horrible what he did . i couldn ' t imagine what i would do if i had my child ripped from me
of course , hind ##sight is 20 / 20 . but going forward you can live in a way that minimize ##s regret .
it ' s really not for them to judge . do what makes you happy .
i know the feelings i had up until my 20 ' s . then i just realized how much they had no right to judge me .
you should always be confident and take risks in life .
ye ##a it reminds me of a time i took a risk on an investment . it paid off !
i second that . i ' ve been to all the parks a bunch of times .
ye ##a my little siblings love taking pictures with them .
work hard at it , poverty is no joke . not an option !
and play smart , do whatever it takes to el ##eva ##te yourself . that is the attitude .
that ' s great ! you must have good credit .
that ' s great , make sure to keep your utilization low if possible .
in what way are you fearful ? i ' ve never thought about that before .
i am 42 , 40 didn ' t bother me . . . . . there is nothing you can do about the aging process . i just try to take getting older in stride .
wow . . . that is exciting . congratulations ! i also won my fantasy football league this year and won $ 300 as well .
i ' m sorry to hear you lost your best friend .
i know the feeling . seeing my friends kid read the books i used to read brings back great memories .
ri ##ii ##ght . it is just so cool to see the younger generations learn and see the things that once brought us joy at one point .
i still love going on planes . makes the headache ##s of airports worth it .
i wish i could still sit in window seats . i ' m too tall now , i can only sit on the aisle .
why do you say it like that ? is everything okay ?
whoa . i ' m really sorry and i really hope that ' s not the case .
i am so sorry to hear that . is it related to your work ?
i see . well , this is how democracy works and we will have to accept it
keep calm . that is the very important step you should take .
you should breath deep and start focusing on the issue in hand .
ah that sounds like a good time . hope it doesn ' t rain for you guys .
ye ##a the radar ##s are usually accurate . cook good food for me .
i hope they are good cooks .
that ' s funny .
i always have the worst luck .
maybe . i think some people are just born with it .
what did you order ?
oh no ! hopefully you will get to wear them on your next trip to the beach .
that is my favorite thing to do . i am sure they are glad when you are home .
you definitely deserve it .
oh my goodness i bet ! i am sorry to hear that you went through that .
well that is definitely good to hear . it must be so hard to go that long as somebody ' s " side kick " and lose them .
that ' s great you are happy with where you are in life . i think the place we work and the area in which we live make a big difference .
having a clear and defined path is important . success comes from hard ##work and dedication .
i love to eat there . one of my favorite foods to eat is steak .
i ' ve never tried that but it looks pretty good . one day i have to try that .
that seems bad and i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?
i am truly sorry to hear that . please accept my apologies for your loss . may he rest in peace
i am sorry to heard that . how long were you together .
i agree with you . i was lonely for a whole year .
was it cold ?
was it cold ?
i ' ve worked in retail before . i ' d be afraid to get stuck in the freeze ##r .
why ? is there something good going to happen on sunday ?
oh yeah ! all ##ez les b ##le ##us ! but good on tiny croatia for even making it that far . that ' s an incredible story for them .
nice . that ' s always a good feeling .
i bet . i know the feeling well since my car is also on its way out .
it ' s so good you stayed loyal , i think anyone would ' ve appreciated a friend like you .
yeah because faithful ##ness is what defines a true friendship , after all .
awe , i am sorry . what made it tough ?
i hate when bosses are like that . is he normally like that ? if so , i would sit him down and talk to him and tell him how his actions are affecting you
i agree with that . victor mental ##ity .
that ' s the spirit that got trump elected .
oh no ! how disappointing . hopefully you didn ' t cut yourself !
oh well at least that is a plus .
i always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings .
whatever makes you happy i guess . to each their own .
how terrible ! i bet your heart stopped in that moment .
people seem to only care about themselves a lot .
i feel you . i also get sad when i see people living of the street .
there not a lot we can do . maybe pre ##sure the local politicians
why ? is it something with your work - life balance ?
you should take it easy . just relax and cross your fingers for the best to come yet
oh no . i am so sorry . that is so hard . my daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him . : ( what was your dog ' s name ?
doo ##dles . that ' s a cute name ! i ' m sorry about your dog . 16 years sounds like a good long life .
what did he do ?
if it doesn ' t work out he can always go back .
i certainly don ' t . i was miserable as a kid .
yes , some worse than others . what do you miss the most ?
you can always organize a reunion for your former classmates .
u ##gh , i hate the waiting game . what ' s the job for ? have you tried calling back and checking in ?

road rage is a problem i deal with too . i have adult add and tend to be imp ##ulsive and am horrible at social ##izing . i ' m glad your alright and i don ' t blame you for getting stressed out by that .
i can ' t believe she didn ' t at least apologize or wave sorry . that ' s why cell phones are horrible and can cause accidents . i ' m glad your ok
have you ever spoken to someone else about it ? it ' s always a relief to talk things out .
she took care of you when you were little so it only makes sense that you ' d want to return the favor . you ' re a good child .
oh yeah ? what happened that day ?
oh no ! i hope everything turned out well at the end of it !
i eventually threw up . anything you have to say though ?
oh well that sounds like it ended well at least . what was the fight about ?
ye ##a i know how you feel , you just feel like you are in pu ##rga ##tory waiting for your demise .
ye ##a but i mean afterwards you don ##t know if you passed the interview

that is very unfortunate that you put all that work in and were let down . i hope something good came out of it like another good job afterwards .
that is not fair for employers to count education more than life experience .
yes ! there ##s nothing like the relief that comes with not having any assignments or projects due
i ' ve never been on a cruise before , i ' m too afraid of the open ocean . where are you going to go cruising ?
oh that ' s too bad ! have you told him how you feel ?
that ' s frustrating ! maybe if you just keep putting your foot down he will eventually get the message . i hope he does soon !
kids are really cute at that age . embrace the cute ##ness while you still can !
no i don ' t have any kids but i teach so i have other people ' s kids to fill that space in my heart .

i ' ve always wanted to go there ! what did you like most about it ?
i bet ! i ' m guessing it must be good weather , then ?
wow ! that must have been he ##ctic . did you have a lot of stuff ?
that ' s crazy . the silver lining to moving for me is being able to get rid of all my junk .
that ' s great to hear ! i am sure you deserved it since you put so much effort in the project .
it is good your supervisor takes notice of your hard work . nothing is more annoying than not getting recognition for effort .
that is amusing to hear . i hope your kids did not cry for their candi ##es
it was wrong of course . i hope you kids would never find out that it was their parent who ate all of their candi ##es
that sounds super fun , i love florida and orlando its quite awesome .
ye ##a that ##s fair , i could imagine if they are so near by you wouldn ##t care about them .
that happens to me all the time because i drive a large van with a lot of extras . it is such a pain !
maybe we both need to buy one of those chargers that you can keep in your car so you don ' t have to ask for a jump .
oh damn , that ' s not good . what happened ?
what the heck , that ' s so bizarre . sorry to hear that it didn ' t work out .

high school sweetheart ##s , that ' s so special . do you ever regret committing yourself to one person so soon ?

ye ##a its a really big deal if it goes through , i hope you guys succeed .
that ' s great . does she practice a lot ?
you must be very proud . i hope she ' s successful .
i bet you were thrilled . there ' s nothing like a heart ##y sandwich to conquer one ' s hunger !
i tend to pile my sandwich as high as i can and still fit it in my mouth . i am like the sc ##oo ##by doo of sandwich doctors .
that ' s unfortunate to hear . it seems like everyone lost that day .
i am sorry . hopefully you can make it up to your friend .
what is your exam on ?
o wow that sounds very tough but i ' m sure you have it as long as you been reviewing the material
i ' ve been in the same pre ##dic ##ament . my lease was coming up and i needed a deposit for a new apartment and my friend was able to help me out .
i agree . if more people were compassionate like that then maybe the world wouldn ' t be as messed up .
that is bad news and hard to deal with .
i sure hope you have a wonderful next holiday trip very soon .
oh no ! did you go out and examine what it is ?
it ' s interesting ! what did happen next ?
lo ##l . hope you had a good camping night !
that sounds like a mixed bag of emotions .
exactly what i was thinking . better cher ##ish the time that you have with him until he goes off to college , but know that he ' ll always appreciate you .
oh no ! that stuff is no good , did you have fun or was it more of a mistake ? ha ##ha .
oh yeah but we all make those mistakes as kids , it ' s good you ' ve mature ##d since then ! ha ##ha .
that ' s great . my mom had three boys , so i ' ll be lucky to have a daughter .
it was more shared with the whole family . but later my dad hired a maid .
you must be really good with reading comprehension and remembering facts . congratulations .
so you ' ve retained all of that info and recalled it from memory during the test . i was never a good history student .
this is how you deal with such people , put him off . rep ##rim ##and such bad behaviors .
you joined the group , don ' t complain next time lo ##l
you are so right . even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most .
i agree . we need to cher ##ish the things we do have in this world .
it could ' ve been a ghost or maybe a robber ?
that ' s awesome that you have a mace . are you king arthur by any chance ?
that ' s great exercise . are you a fan of sports ?
deer can be pretty ridiculous . i am glad you are okay .
that ' s crazy , i couldn ' t imagine buying a car at 18 . what kind of job did you have that you were able to do that ?
that ' s a pretty great setup so soon in live . you ' re very fortunate .
yeah for sure . luck only gets you so far , the rest is up to you .
you def ##ini ##tley had something to be proud of . not many 18 year olds can say they did that
why were you mort ##ified ? i don ' t know too much about net neutrality .
oh yes i am sure you did great , public speaking is a good skill too have .
why do you have to stress so much to get black friday sales
okay . i think you need to find a better source of income so that you will not have to wait for black friday to get what you want
sorry to hear that . have you talked with your cow ##or ##ker or boss about it ?
well , maybe just ask for a meeting with your boss and go from there .
the news can be so sad . that is horrible that that occurred !
people need to step up and start helping others . i will pray too
oh ! it ' s excellence . hope you enjoy your next year
yeah ! you ' re right . once you ' ve moved there , you started to love your city too !

ye ##a it is one of the best feelings
ha ##ha ##h ye ##a i have done that more than once .
what flavor was the cookie ?

hitting kids is kind of going out of style . people do time ##out more now .
absolutely , i can ' t imagine being betrayed by a friend .
the best virtue in life .
that ' s great . i just built my first computer actually .
i ' m not sure what a commodore is . i don ' t really program much either , but i ' m interested . i play a ton of pc games though .
wow getting a promotion is always an awesome thing . you guys must be so happy ! will you guys be celebrating this success ?
fair enough , that is very reasonable . maybe you guys can celebrate on the weekend when you guys don ' t have work .
i hate when that happens . i wish more people would be more cautious when they drive !
yes . . it is best to be a defensive driver and keep yourself as safe as possible since there are so many crazy drivers out there !
that is greta . is she really nice ?
ok , so it is early days . when is the date ?
well let me know how it all go ##e !
that sounds crazy ! what happened ?
that sounds like it would give me a heart attack .
i am sure that was quite a delightful experience , especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it . was it regular tea or flavor ##ed ?
you had an in ##vi ##gor ##ating tea , delicious ! would you have it again or was this a one time encounter with tea ?
no i don ' t know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key
if you trust your neighbour it is fine
nice , like which ones to be specific ?
i love delicious foods more so ter ##i ya ##ki , so yu ##mmy .
i ' m glad you made it out alive . i wonder what drugs they were on . some drugs actually make you more careful .
good thing he wasn ' t drunk or he very well could have gotten in an accident . alcohol really imp ##air ##s motor skills .
damn , what would you rate both of them ? i know it might be a little childish but it helps me picture it ha ##ha .
wow he really dated up this time around , lucky him i suppose .
that ' s really tough . i can imagine how frustrated you are . just know that going through trials and struggling is always good for your character and you will end up that much better of a person for getting through it . you can ' t be too concerned with other ' s lives , you just have to try not to compare .
oh well that ' s too bad but their behavior is not right or fair , and they will deal with the consequences of that themselves . for ##giving them is good for you and for them . just try your best to let go , i know it ' s tough - but people everywhere are way more successful then you and way less successful and you don ' t compare yourself to them i hope so why focus on one random guy just because he ' s your brother .
that is good . you finally conquer it all with your patient .
i will advice though , in some cases you have to report this to the security agencies
sorry to hear that . was it a difficult course ?
that is good if you could pass it .
i know what you mean , childhood friends are so important and treasure ##d
i agree , it feels great to have someone stick around for so long
good for him ! sounds like he ' s a real slug ##ger !
did they end up winning the game ?
yu ##m ! i used to love ore ##o blizzard ##s . there was a rusty hair ##pin in my burger from there when i was a kid . i almost swallowed it .

om ##g lo ##l . well maybe that wasn ' t so nice ! e ##w ##w ##w ##w .
that is outstanding news . you must be a great parent to raise a son who got through college .
great that he finished early !
interesting , sounds like a metal band concert i went to where people were a bit goth . did you go ?
college was an odd time , people the same age you didn ' t know that well .
law seems difficult it seems . .
you should also have a sharp memory to remember , what ever you have studied . .
you seem to be an avid soccer fan . is croatia your favorite team ?
oh i get it , that is pretty cool . i like a good under ##dog story . so this world cup should be very exciting !

ye ##a , i love surprises , especially from loved ones
well then avoid the stories that scare you .
well there ' s no reason to waste your time reading scary stories .
oh wow . so she ' s kind of famous it seems
that ' s amazing . my mother was also a beauty contest winner when she was 18 .
did your girlfriend cheat on you ?
but most people are still faithful in their relationship
now , that is what happens when you are a cat lover .
you are so kind . i ' m never good with pets .
cong ##rat ##ulation for the baby . is a good or bad su ##pr ##ise that our grandmother is coming ?
i understand . it is always good to have someone that you can count on .
oh that ' s frustrating , have you told them how you felt ?
oh that ' s too bad , i wonder if you could find a way to politely say something so you can focus .
oh , that ' s awesome . you feeling nervous about that ?
what if it ' s opposite ?
you never know these days
oh really , what was the judge ' s reaction to that
i am sorry . but i hope you have learnt your lesson this way
really , so what was your reaction then ?
wow , that ' s terrifying you know
aw ##w ##w , you need to take a nap , for you to focus and read

that ' s natural . just don ' t tell him lo ##l . you ' ll be alright buddy .
sorry , what is correct
yeah . . . so tell me more
uh oh , how did they react to that
ou ##ch ! that ' s too bad . i would have been cr ##inging !
wow , you must be very brilliant
for them to really give you that , that means you got sharp brain
that ' s awesome ! what type of foods did you mostly eat ?
those sound like much health ##ier choices . congratulations ! how long did it take to achieve your goal ?
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha , it ' s really scary to read scary stories at night . . i had that experience
ha ##ha ##ha , you thought it was a ghost right ? ?
i wonder what was the work you were doing so passionate ##ly ?
that ' s interesting . you must be very talented
really , i missed that . tell me more !
i see you enjoy gambling .
what ' s your report on ?
where subject are you studying ?
oh no . can you wash it ?
that is worrying , you might have to throw it out ?
where were they ?
i ' m glad you found them .
wow , that cat must have loved that shoe , he wanted it
that is true , especially when you don ' t give them attention
has he put in a lot of effort in studying and trying to improve ?
show ' s working hard is really important with act . how did you do in yours ?
no way that sounds pretty extreme , did you really ?
ha ##ha well that ' s cool , did it last long ?
wow , that is a big decision . are you well prepared for the move ?
moving can be both adventurous and a big headache . you have to make big decisions about disc ##arding many old possessions and selling your house if you have one .
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha , what was she thinking ?
it ' s really annoying right
she may have done something else to " earn " that promotion , if you know what i mean ; )
well perhaps you can brush up on some sabotage skills lo ##l : ) get her out , get yourself back in the game . good luck !
good guys finish last . you have to be like trump lo ##l aggressive
think of it this way : it ' s not revenge , it ' s punishment
i ' m so sorry to hear that . at least you enjoyed your time with her in the moment ?
well , hey . at least there ' s plenty more fish in the sea . maybe the next one will be the one .
good to hear that , what is interesting
that ##s great . i hope they do on my side too

yeah for sure . . . so where are they coming from ? ?
that ' s good to hear ! what sort of things has he changed or started doing ?
how long did it take him to lose all that weight ?
i tried it when i was a student . it wasn ' t my cup of tea . how did you find it ?
good . what did you think of amsterdam ? i have been there 3 or 4 times .
i am from the uk so i think it ' s less of a culture shock for us . i remember seeing very high americans wandering around as if te ##hy had over ind ##ul ##ged .
it was pretty great but it was rough at times . you ?
that ' s great to hear ! mine was mostly happy but of course there was some issues .
yeah , i know how you feel . not exactly the same situation , though . i was going through with an adoption , but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless .
well , yes and no . there ' s ups and downs , but you get used to the responsibilities . just expect more stress from your wife than anything else .
sorry to hear that . what was the dispute about ?
i understand . it should have been not easy .
wow , did he forget your address ?
wow , that is really nice
lies are never a good thing in a relationship . have you had a friend who was lying to you ?
that is a good place to start , i mean a relationship not built on truth is very shaky and is liable to fall apart very quickly .
this is so funny . i didn ' t hear it anywhere .
oh really , its sounds terrible .
wow , cool how did that happen ?
that ' s nice of her , i love when teachers go out on a limb for students like that ,
oh that ' s very resource ##ful of you . did everything go as expected ?
nice ! you sound like a great caretaker .
i ' m sorry , i don ' t understand ?
it ' s always good to expand your knowledge .
oh really ? why is that ? seems like you were aware of it
nice , good for you my dude . hard to get girls these days .
i hate when my cat used to do that . would this happen often ?
cats can really be such strange pets sometimes , i swear they live off of our momentary hatred for them
hi

i ' ve not seen the movie
ha ##ha ##ha i really love to see horror movies , but i don ' t usually get scared
very true . who has helped you out recently ?
how long have you known them ?

like bad dreams or what ?
oh that really sucks , hopefully you get that dealt with .
a mother , father and a brother . you ?
nice ! family is so important .
what engineering type did you graduate in ?
that ' s good to hear . you can always keep searching for that dream job while you work .
that it is cool . there was an old game that i loved crash band ##ico ##ot . recently , they did a re ##master of this game .
did you try crash band ##ico ##ot ka ##rt ? it is the one that i liked the most . i was playing this game several hours a day with friends .
that must be really annoying ! what were they late to this time ?
4 hours late ! totally unacceptable ! but hey , at least you live near a beach .
greed consume ##s all . by the way who are you implying about ?
totally agree . they say one thing and do another just to keep in power .
jealousy is the root of hatred , too bad
why will u be consumed ?
that ' s awesome . i never won , but i got close !
that ' s good man there will be more trust me .
tell me about it . how long have you been job hunting for ?
did you travel anywhere for your vacation ?
aw ##w ##w , are you always shy ? ?

what field is that ?
that ' s awesome . what charity ?

i wish i could be as lucky as you . well happy bela ##ted birthday .
that ' s not good . do you find yourself in that situation frequently ?
i suppose that works . sorry you feel that way .
wow , that must be very terrifying
that is so bad , really not cool .
that ' s not too bad . computer science isn ' t easy by any standards .
that ' s cool . i ' m studying bio ##che ##m at the moment .
that is true , but why the air nike ##s ? haven ' t you heard about their effect on women ?
they ' re known to cause erect ##ile dysfunction ? there ' s chemicals in the lace ##s , dude ! a conspiracy i tell you ! done by obama !
that ##s horrible . i mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time .
sorry to hear that . i guess your boss must have been feeling the same as you were about the nanny .
oh boy , that is a very delicate situation . do you plan on telling her ?
i understand your fear , but it will be worse of you keep that big of a secret from her , especially if she finds out some other way .
that ' s good to hear , it ' s always great to have a good relationship with your parents !
yeah , un ##con ##ditional love is something that is hard to come by .
that ' s amazing ! i wish i could lift that much .
you ' ll get there in no time . i believe in you .
ah , re ##mini ##sc ##ing can be nice sometimes though . what was the name of the song ?
i remember martin mystery ! i loved that show .
of course , i waking up early just for it .

wow , fear is a bad experience
babies are a treasure . do you have any ?
my wife is 6 months pregnant .
does ghost really exist ?
wa ##o , i don ##t want to see them at all
cong ##rat ##s my friend . how old is he now ?
it only gets worst once he ' s in his teenage years and bringing girls home ! but it ' s worth it in the end .
what works in particular ?
i agree wholly , quite an imp ##ec ##cable spectrum . i read online on 4 ##chan that da vinci was likely an alien from the future .
i was always jealous because my brothers didn ' t need to work as hard after i moved away .
it was funny because i was out with one of the pre ##tti ##est girls ever telling her i was jealous . i shouldn ' t have been though .
they have done well - do you think they are unknown though ? the were semi - finalists in 1998 and have had lots of good players over the years ( pro ##sin ##eck ##i , su ##ker , bo ##ks ##ic , sa ##vic ##evic , bob ##an )
i always loved their strip when i was younger . it was the first time a team had played in checks .
i hope it is not too bad . you sent it to who ?
what did you say to them ?
that sucks . where were you supposed to be travelling to ?
wow , jamaica would is one of the places i dream of visiting . i guess work comes first though .
why , have you have bad experiences ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
what made you good children ?
what country were you brought up in ?
cool , whose testimony ?
are they still going on about the election ?
have you tried therapy ?
yes i think so . i know people who have overcome ph ##ob ##ias and fears that way .
awesome , where in europe will you be visiting ?
i ' m jealous . it will be amazing and i think you ' ll have great fun there soaking up the culture and wine also i suppose .
what stuff ?
who stole them ?

i ' m happy for you . you only have one life and should do what makes you happy .

ah , i can see why that would be stress ##ful / upset ##ting . well , it is good to plan ahead , but don ' t stress about it too much until you know for certain you are part of that 25 % , the odds are still in your favour .
that was rude . maybe she didn ' t hear you ?

i haven ' t seen it
woo ##ow that must really be interesting
i have a few times , my mom is really into cooking shows , so i watched them a lot growing up , and still catch a few now and then .
yeah , gordon can be pretty supportive too , and soft spoken , which is surprising .
yeah , and mostly near the end . when its the first few rounds i think he feels they haven ' t earned any sort of sympathy or support , since things are just starting out .
some friend . maybe he ' s ins ##ecure and thought you or her were flirting ?
well then he shouldn ' t have jumped to conclusions . things aren ' t always what they seem
oh no . sorry to hear that .
pets are family . we still want them to be around no matter what .
i ' m sorry , why not ?
i completely understand , i ' ve been in that pre ##dic ##ament and it sucks .
really bad . . . did you come last ? ?

i know what you mean . all the people seem to be the same types - fame hungry na ##rc ##iss ##ists
sorry to hear that , what happened ?
that was a hard watch . they were a strong young team and should have won but missed a few chances in the first half .
shame on you . did you at least pass ?
and you didn ' t get caught either ?
wow that sounds like fun
i completely understand
i absolutely feel the same way . it is a rare trait , but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task .
yes , that too . or does not contribute as much like they should , i . e . , critical thinking / part ##ici ##pa ##tory contributions
ha ##h !
i have no idea what that is .
oh . if he is guilty i hope he gets what ' s coming to him .
well done . did you study very hard for it or are you just very smart ?
well done , good effort .

i guess children could have that tendency , how fun
that is ama ##zi ##ing !

i still have two years left . i hope to have that feeling too .
oh no sounds scary . what happened next ?
that goodness for that ! there is nothing worse than hearing noises like that when you are alone walking .
ha ##ha . ye like its normal to them . nasty
hey , eating dogs are normal to some ! sick
oh , that ' s not good . did he say anything ?
how come ? direction of life swaying you away from your family ?
oh no why ?
that sucks . i couldn ' t be without my kids . maybe you should go to counseling .
i bet you were . who isn ' t ?
i couldn ' t wait to not wake up early . then i got a job lo ##l
i consider myself a food ##ie now . im skinny , but i love food
oh no ##o
me too . they really are a man or woman ##s best friend . do you have dogs ?
i have a little pu ##g . she is always so pleased to see me and loyal . are your dogs the same ?
its really devastating . but what really happened
wow , but its your personal life
oh yeah ? when was this ?
that ' s too bad . i actually own a ball python , she ' s pretty cute .
is that good or bad ?
oh wow . that ' s awesome . i want to adopt too . maybe foster .
oh ? what did he or she do ?
what are the payments for ?
that ' s great , congratulations
om ##g , i ' m so sorry . i just realized my eyes focused on promotion results . i think there is a silver lining in every situation
what meal do you speak of ? breakfast ? lunch ? dinner ? midnight snack ?
that is awful ! ! ! what happened to the fly ? did you manage to sho ##o it away or end its poor , miserable life ?
oh no , that is not cool
i understand how you feel , such thing have happened to me before
what happened there ?
are you doing okay ? anything ser ##io ##ius ?
that sounds like a lot of fun
wow be safe
sorry to hear about your loss . sometimes its better for it to be sudden rather than wait 6 months for the cancer to destroy you
everything passes with time
so decide wise ##ly how it is spent : )
when are you going to find out your acceptance ?
oh , congratulations ! which college ?
oh now why is that
oh wow
wow , now you have a brother , that is good to know
so , how cute is he ?
hello my friend ! i will gladly wish you all the luck in the world , if you would only tell me what i am wishing it for !
ah , i see ! do you feel prepared for the examination ? did you spend a lot of time hitting the books ?
of course i have , it ' s really hard
was it in the morning ? did you rush home immediately ? how did you manage ?
college changes you . sometimes for the worse . glad to hear about your brother
probably boosted his self confidence too
yes , i agree it ' s a big concern . do you live in an area of the world directly affected ?
that ' s really scary ! i ' ll try to keep spreading the word for people to be more eco - conscious .
how did it go ?
that ##s good . it doesn ##t always work out that well .
you and me both
that is good , do you like nice cars ?
i am sorry about your car trouble , good luck with that .
you must be really happy , i bet you have a beautiful wife and lots of money in the bank : )
that is what matters , to have a supportive and lovely wife
i understand . i have been lonely most of my life . but , it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part .
i have a solution for that , but i wouldn ' t advocate you doing it .
i can only imagine the destruction and how horrible it is to deal with that !
i am very sorry to hear that . i hope for your sake that things are getting back to normal and the destruction is being taken care of .
that ##s great , i feel there is someone out there for everyone
i hear you there , i have also , but now i am in the best relationship ever ! ! !
oh really ? why is that ? because you don ' t have to deal with their antics while they ' re knocked out ?
i can imagine . fortunately , i don ' t have any kids yet , so i do not know the pain of dealing with a bunch of crazy kids ! although , it must be very reward ##ing .
it is one the worst pains . you would think we ' d keep our toes more protected
stepping on lego ##s are just as bad . and they are my kids ' favorite toys !
that sounds so frightening ! was your husband helpful ?
i agree ! i would have been screaming , too ! ( and i would have been annoyed at my husband for laughing ! )
i ' m so sorry , how sad . do you wish you had been with her to say goodbye .
of course i can understand it , but at least she probably didn ' t suffer and is now in heaven .
that is always nice . were they excited to see you ?
that is awesome . life can be random like that sometimes .
never . i don ' t remember a time when it was that cheap anywhere in the world
good memory . we all have to change with the times .
i don ' t even take beer
no ##oo , the first time i took it , i mis ##be ##ha ##ved
wow you sound really prepared for something .
oh no , is the end coming ?
i can imagine , and how did things go ?
great , it is true that new places and situations can be exciting but scary at the same time
oh wow , that has to be a bucket list item for sure .
that would have been fun , maybe next year
wow , why did you involve your self in spilling a bowl of cereal ?
that ' s very serious . what are you going to do about the bowl now ?
cool . guess now you can be president .
i want to secretary of treasury . is that still a thing ?
really
network do di ##sa ##pp ##oint
om ##g . i know exactly how you feel . i had a lump on my back but got it removed . turned out to be just fatty tissue . size of a tennis ball !
good deal . i think it was stress related .
wow that ' s nice , he must be very intelligent
aw ##w ##w that ' s nice , just take care of them
happy friday indeed ! yes i can ' t wait to finish work for today even when i am just beginning .
yeah , i have to . and do you have plans for the weekend ?
oh wow . did your friend do something to upset you or something like that ? or were you just wanting some alone time ?
well everyone has their pace . maybe the next time you go you can invite her but take more time . it ' s fun , either way !
really ? what sort of cooking do you like to do ?
i love spaghetti myself ! i ' m not a good cook at all though . i ' m always eating out .
yeah that ' s very true . but it is much easier than learning to cook myself .
cool . most people don ##t like training .
i bet he appreciate ##s you being nice though .
that was nice of her . i like pulling surprises on people too .
hope you had a good birthday .
i live in an apartment so i take mine out to the dump ##ster every few weeks . i feel your pain though . growing up i had to take ours down our steep driveway every week .
it is da ##unt ##ing . i think i still have nightmares about it . i feel dirty just thinking about it right now .
must have been a good result . was it for a job , school , or for medical results ?
i am sure your family was proud of you , as well !
i am so sorry to hear that , it must have been heartbreak ##ing . how did your family cope ?
well that ' s good to hear . possessions can be replaced but your family is all that really matters in the end !
i bet that is an experience you are still trying to get used to
i see a lot of cars that do not watch out for motorcycles , be careful out there
that ##s awesome . i wish everyone could go to college if they wanted
yeah . if only
money issues are always hard .
well , you should look into that
oh no ! i hope you are ok .
things happen we can ##t do anything about it , i hope this accident ##ly won ##t affect you in the long term
everything was in the end , but at first not so much .
yeah , it was a nice learning experience .
it must have been embarrassing . hope it ended well for you .
i ' m happy for you .
oh no ! did they react by laughing , helping , or ignoring ?
i can see where that would be embarrassing . i hope your pride wasn ' t hurt too much . . . or you physically !
news that big would be a shock to anyone ! how did you both handle it ?
i ' m glad you both found the courage to face it head on . nice job !
most definitely ! . dogs are important members of a family .
indeed . my son called our dog his cousin for a little while . . . weird i know .
oh , that is frustrating ! i love chinese food . what did you order ?
crab rang ##oon is one of my favorites . i would be bum ##med too . i think i know what i am having for dinner tonight .
yes ! they are super fun . have you ?
i always am as well because i am not an artist by any means .
oh no ! is everything okay now ?
i know that ' s tough . it ' s scary when your kids go through something like that . it never leaves you when its time to do it all over again .
that ##s good news ! what did they do to surprise you ?
amazing , im happy for you . : )
why were you struggling ?
i understand . it is impossible to live with only one income for family . i am happy she have an interview .
being in debt is so stress ##ful and i ' m sure that just adds to it .
i don ' t blame you . i have been in that position with a credit card i forgot to pay when we moved and they didn ' t have the correct forward ##ing address . stress on top of stress . : (
i would have loved to study criminal justice
i hear you . i love true crime , so i think that would be such a fun thing to study
oh no , what a sad and scary situation . how are they now ?
i can ' t imagine how hard that must have been . i ' m glad he is doing better !
people drive more and more badly . did you take the plate number ?
i understand . i am happy that nothing bad happened to you .
oh no that ' s unfortunate , did you make fun of him or something ?
oh , well sometimes we say things we don ' t mean . if you apologize he ' ll probably accept it and be fine again .
oh ##h that ##s great news , cong ##rat ##ulate him on my behalf .
no one dies along , i am sure there might be a person in this world that is made for you , this is just not the right time to meet that guy . just wait and it will come in front you when you really need it .
yu ##p ! enjoy the life at its full ##est without wo ##rring
it sounds good just reading those words , what kind was it ?
well pizza for breakfast every once and a while won ' t kill you , it sounds delicious .
wow ! was it a scratch ##er or did you have to pick numbers ?
wow . lucky you . you should try it again .
cool ! where are you going ?
wow ! have you been there before ? they have an amazing culture
wait . what happened ?

i am happy that she is trying something . sport is important for kids .
i have always wanted to work abroad . what work are you doing there ?
cool . and cong ##rat ##s on your future engagement !
i can see why you feel that way . sometimes addict ##s aren ' t in full control of their decisions , though .
i think you have a right to be mad over that .
wow ! i would have felt some type of way to . what did you do after
ye ##a or be there next time she makes dinner and give her tips eating raw chicken is very bad
have you tried making any ?
maybe try going out to concerts or clubs or sporting events , somewhere you can find people with common interests
oh no . is there a lot of parking available ?
i agree . i had an apartment with limited parking and people that didn ' t live there always parked there anyway .
none that i know of ! i feel you . . if i ever had a daughter i ' d be over ##pro ##tec ##tive and stress ##ing
nope lock her in the basement
where can you get that kind of weather .
you had me at cheap liquor
that ' s cool . it ' s good to have loyal friends
what are some personality traits you both have in common
that ' s important . there ' s always tomorrow though .
i wish . i bought a spin bike in january and have used it once . i have to quit smoking .
this happens many times , they just don ' t care of us
our siblings , leaving us all alone in a party or a club .
what was the song ?
is it short ski ##r ' t long jacket . i love that song .
oh no that ' s so gross ! do you know what
my landlord has the same issue .
yes same for me just have to fix up the credit score a bit more ha .
wow that sounds pretty stress ##ful
did he / she turn out fine without complications ?
wow is that really something that happens ?
i don ' t think i believe you .
well , is that something you can do ?
right , well is there any other way ?
look carefully before you sign .
that ' s cool . was it not like that before ?
my family is like that too .
he didn ' t bring you anything ?
that ' s strange . i always try to buy gifts for my family when i go on a trip .
e ##w ##w ##w . i haven ' t done that in a while . thankfully .
they sure do . isn ' t it the law ?
oh that ' s the worst , i try to remember to charge but it ' s hard to remember every time .
so he ' s the cu ##lp ##rit ! he better start charging it or else it ' s revoked !
what were you guys looking to buy ?
i ' ve done that more than once , i ' m terrible at names
that is interesting , what things do you do while living in america to keep your heritage alive ?
i would imagine that might be difficult , perhaps there are some online social groups you could join as well ?
just be careful not to burn it .
no sauce at all ? surely you didn ' t mean that too ?
oh no . sorry to hear that . is it different now ?
be patient and things will fall into place . you ' ll be fine .
oh no . were they okay ?
be careful . it could have been worse .
well that must be exciting to have so much variety , how old are they ?
you sound like a great parent , they ' re lucky to have you !
must ' ve been a pretty vivid dream
did you grow up with dogs
family is important .
i have three . they are my world . i wish we lived in the country and not the city .
oh no , that must have been terrible .
how long ago was it , were you hurt ?
well , we all do . i hope you achieve what you set out to do
oh , well what are you looking forward too ?
it was a fire warning ?
wow , what is it a big one ?
that has to be disappointing . can you change your plans ?
now you have something to look forward to .
i think that ' s the way to go when it comes to a wedding . use the money for your future as a couple , not for one day . but to each their own , so you were impressed ?
my suggestion is to go for your favorite food rather than some fancy cater ##ed food that you don ' t even enjoy !
oh no , that ' s terrible . can you walk maybe with some support at least ?
i see , that ' s too bad but maybe there will be more marathon ##s you can participate in in the future .
did you get any damage ?
it could ' ve been much worse . that ' s good .
oh no ! i would have been so disgusted ! and mad !
that sounds awful . i hope you filed a complaint with the restaurant !
aw ##w ##w , when are you planning to visit them ?
i really hope you will be able to visit them then ! i know how you feel , i didn ' t see my parents for a couple of years
nice , there is not a lot of people like you

wow nos ##tal ##gic . wish you had time machine . .
best phase of our life .
do you know where you ' re going yet ?
well , that ' s a nice plan . i hope you enjoy yourself .

how come ?
how far away has she gone ?
any chance you could move too ?
oh no . is everything okay now ?
well at least he changed . that doesn ' t always happen .
i hate that . it makes it really hard to want to go home .
that would be good for you . maybe you will get some good neighbors then .
you weren ' t thinking about the surgery at all ?
that would freak me out too .
that is bad . i hope you found a solution with him .
you can sue him
what song / instrument was being played
nice i love metallic ##a . was he using a loop station and a backing track or what
wow that ' s pretty good , you must be a member of the thousand pound club ?

yes , i watch the show . that is a bit scary though but not that much .
oh ##h come on its not that scary , you should watch whole season .
ha ##ha , ok as you wish then
nice did you become sort of a nature girl after that experience ? or were you just trauma ##tized ha ##ha
that ' s pretty cool . so i ' m guessing you ' re more of a city gal
that ' s sad , maybe you were meant to be with your ex though .
i know but i think we ' re meant to stay with our first loves honestly , but maybe that ' s too ideal ##istic .
was it a nice one ?
do you have kids ?
it ' s never to late to start new . you guys will be fine .
is it too hot to cook or do you just hate cooking ?
don ' t feel bad , i have those days , too . i keep boiled eggs handy for those times eating out gets too excessive . ( protein )
that ' s a good strategy .
i didn ' t i was a cheer ##leader though if you want to count that .
well at least you can find an excuse to step outside the house and mix it up !
i love call of duty . what ' s your rank
what was the announcement ?
wow , congratulations ! i bet you worked hard for that !
i wish you ' ll also move soon . anyway i ' m happy for your neighbor .
everyone has their time , yours will come soon

right ? they can go get a job as a garbage collector if they want to act that way !
what game was it ? did you give him tips ?
was he upset with you for it ?
oh snap ! that is not a good thing to hear about .
well probably should confront him and if he ' s lying get rid of him .
that ' s cool . how old are they now
wow that is quite a gap . . . do you still keep in touch with each of them
i ' ve always wanted a sur ##pi ##rse party ! ! were you happy that they surprised you in this way ?
i always find it amazing that people never see it coming .

i know ! i ' m going school shopping tomorrow . its tax free weekend !
no kidding . plus i ' m buying for two so double the cost this year .
what about it brings back memories ?
that is always fun . lots of good memories there .
ha , many times . i once blamed my dog for breaking a friend ' s tv , but it was me
was it a good reason ? i can ' t say i ' ve ever done that before
oh man ! that must of hurt even if it didn ' t break .
it ' s crazy how glass is hard to notice when it ' s like perfectly clean .
did you do something really fun ?
i know what you mean . sometimes in can all the difference in the world to be able to just relax for a while .
how did you manage that ?
oh that makes sense . i hope you found out quickly before anyone else could see .
that must have been really hard on you .
at least you had the dog to cheer you up !
that is great ! has he overcome an illness or heart issue ? that can be serious and very scary !
oh wow that is great , is he feeling better since showing improvement ?

oh no , what happened to your wipe ##rs ?
i bet that was scary !
oh no . it ' s hard to get mad at them when there really isn ' t anything you can do about it now .
maybe a car dealers ##hip could help .

that ' s the great thing about sports , anything can happen .
it is nice . how old is she ?

do i need to steal one of her toys to teach her a lesson ?
well , i don ' t see the point in that .
at least you ' ve got work here though .
oh ##hh i feel you ! lo ##l . . . mine isn ##t quite school aged yet but i was just saying today i can ##t wait . ( ha ha ! ) how old are they ?

me too . i plan like 10 years ahead of time . how far in advance do you plan ?
better safe than sorry

i understand , it ' s hard to find the time for everything sometimes .
15 . wow . that has to be tough .
i hope it doesn ' t get to bad for him .
why do you say that ? are you a man or woman ?
everything happens for a reason . i was single until i was 29 . i met the right one on a dating app . no shame in an app .
i went through 4 dates and then i met the one i am with . try again ! i have been with for cl ##so ##e to 2 years .
good luck ! sometimes single is nice tho .
oh i am doing the same thing but for a different reason .
that ##s wonderful news ! did you make a nice profit ?
ye ##a , between kids , cleaning , and everything else , its hard to stay energetic
ye ##a , then you ha ##e to do it all yourself
i love that feeling , though i don ' t experience it often . why did it make you happy ?
oh that ' s good ! i remember waiting for those ref ##unds when i was in school .
that ' s always good news . were you worried something was wrong ?
i ' m guessing all those small concerns turned out well if everything turned out fine .
a hurricane ? that sounds awful ! where is it , i haven ' t heard anything about one , i live in florida .
i better check , its better to be prepared then dead ! !
e ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w . kinda gross . my cats used to do that too .
me either . only serial killers like dead animals .
its always better to rely on ourselves . im happy for you !
honestly , its during our worst times we realize our true strength . good for you .
been there . done that .
it does . then she turns 13 and is a brick wall lo ##l .
i understand that ! mine has one too , and it gets frustrating !
yeah of course , i just don ##t even talk to him when he has them on . i gave up
lo ##l that is sort ##a funny though . i can just picture this .
maybe you should sneak over and mo ##w it for him when he isn ' t home .
you wouldn ' t believe that ' s happened to me too !
i was 22 . registering for college classes and i was freaking out so bad , they just told me to come back the next day . i didn ' t go back
really ? i tried to use hu ##lu once but it wasn ##t for me . you going to watch it tonight ?
i don ##t like scary either im a baby i guess
that ' s good ! it ' s always nice to have friends you can rely on
i wish i had that kind of relationship . i left most of that when i moved : (
oh no . i
that ' s great . i wonder how many hike ##rs actually keep a first aid kit ?
that ##s wonderful . are you pregnant ?
wow how much longer ?
oh , it ' s good . take your all belongings without fail . hope you ' ll have good journey .

i hate shots for babies . why do they have to get so many ? ! ? ! ? !
you can tell they are mad at you too for letting it happen . i hate ir
yu ##m sounds good what ##s your fa ##v topping ##s ?
: o uh ##hh oh you had to pick them off
cool . i hope you get it . is it a lot more pay ?
i ' ve never gotten a promotion at any job . but i ' ve never wanted more responsibility
awesome . are you going to s cho ##ol or your children ?
right i work from home so i feel you
did he come through ?
that ' s great i have a couple of friends like that
that would certainly make me upset too , was it your neighbors ?
very annoying , i would consider getting the police to pay a visit even .
she probably understood .
if she is a really good friend then she did . don ##t worry about it .
sorry to hear that . is there any chance you two can patch up again ?
oh , then try to keep busy yourself so you don ' t feel alone .
that is a shame . i hear that is happening a lot in schools today .
they don ' t have time for all that . they are trying to teach .
did something go wrong with the interview ?
competition is tough these days . for whatever reason , that job wasn ' t meant to be and you ' ll find your perfect fit soon .
that ' s really annoying . did you send it back to the kitchen ?
i think you ' ll probably be fine but , that dose ##n ' t mean your lunch isn ' t ruined .
are you going to re - order from some where else ?
you could always just go the su ##shi route from now on . you can ' t ud ##ner cook it .
congratulations
that ' s great . some people aren ' t so lucky . they die at a job they hate
that ' s awesome . i hope you love it
were you able to get it off of your shoe ?
keep working at it , you ' ll get it all . try ice on it to harden the gum first .
its really hot where i live . i ' m ready for it to be over . its 100 ##f out side right now and very hum ##it .
i guess its different if you live where it gets cold during the winter .
you continues a series on netflix i hope and not the other thing
you shouldn ' t have . what happened ?
that ##s nice . she ' s becoming a teenager full force !
i am sure she will be fine . we all made it through .
why were you nervous ?
oh i see . how did it go ?
i bet you were .
that just means more food for you . that sounds like a win to me .
tell them the next time they need to get up if they want good food , too .
that has been happening a lot lately . everyone in the us seems to be getting wet .
im so sorry you got rained out . do you at least get a ref ##und ?
whoa , that ' s scary ! did you freak out ?
i can imagine . did it look like a stereo ##typical ghost , like casper ?
oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that , were you close ?
oh that ' s so sweet , i wish i kept in touch with my family too
cool . was it an all night ##er ?
that ' s my kind of party .
that ' s really good ! have you been driving distracted when you uber ?
oh okay sorry , i was just a little distracted about my car accident the other day .
this semi pushed us off the road i ' m still a little freaked out about it
well that ' s nothing compared to what could have happened .
who else was in the car
what happened ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . that ' s awful . how long were you together ?
you must not have been speeding too much !
were you nervous being pulled over ? i ' ve never been pulled over myself .
that ' s great , how did the interview end up going ?
that ' s always great , better be be over prepared . so , did you get the job offer ?
oh no ! they are terrifying little dogs aren ' t they ?
they ' re really loud too actually , they bark a whole lot more than other dogs
oh i totally hear you there . you can ##t just like be yourself , and not that being yourself is bad or anything
yeah me either . once people get to know me its fine but usually people don ##t like me when they first meet me . id ##k !
you still consider them your friends after that ?
that ' s messed up .
wow , that ' s absurd . . of course it ' s the one that ' s imp ##ot ##rant .
that ' s always so awful . . it ' s too bad it wasn ' t something you bought with a credit card and could just dispute it . .
i can see why you ' d be happy about it , i mean you doubled up even with it being a small amount ! where did you buy it ?
wow , i mean everything happens for a reason . . that ' s great !
oh go ##sh , that ' s horrible . i can ' t imagine how you feel . i would be so heart ##broken
you don ' t deserve it ! nobody deserves it
it happens . i hate being late
oh go ##sh lo ##l that ' s so funny .
i am a pretty trusting person also .
it ' s okay to trust , but always be cautious too .
that really sucks ! have you put up any posters to help you find him ?
well i hope you find him . hopefully nothing bad happened to him .
oh yeah those lines can be super long . what did you do ?
oh no that is terrible . what happened to all your things ?
oh no , that ' s horrible . . july is not the time for that ! do you have someone ready to come out and fix it yet ?
that ' s good to hear , how hot is it where you are ?
oh man , good for you ! i would have cave ##d for sure . pizza is my life
so true . i always eat it all . i really can ' t control myself so better not to even start . good on you
wow that ##s awesome , what kind of car did you get ?
that was a good choice , did you consider any other makes / models ?
don ' t blame you there i remember by kid getting his first shots . he was so upset and wouldn ##t stop crying .
i got lucky there he was fine after we got him away from the doctors office and got him his very treat .
ya ##y ! ! ! cong ##rat ##s ! that ' s so exciting , i ' m really happy for you
you will ! i believe in you . just go with a flow and take one day at a time . your baby will love you so much
you should read the instructions before you start . . you need to work off the prompt ##s . . but hello ,
yes . i did go to college , but i did not complete it .
i hate when that happens !
i ' m happy for you . i have been in that situation before .
well , even going by yourself you can always have a good time , especially with alcohol involved ! did you end up having fun ?
that ' s when you drink more and talk to everyone around you and make a good time for yourself !
uh oh . . definitely not where you wanna go if you don ' t like clown ##s ! were you afraid while you were there ?
that ' s terrible ! did you make it through the entire show ?
aw ##h man , that stink ##s . . i never watched it before . . i ' m assuming you really liked it ?
yep why is it always with the good tv shows that it happens ! ?
cong ##rat ##s ! hard work really does pay off .
i can only imagine how excited you must of been when you got the promotion .
there are a bunch of people who really don ' t ! i don ' t get really why people are afraid of it , though .
yeah , i guess i can see why that would fright ##en some people . . night ##lights work wonders !
yes , i think everyone was shocked ! the real question is , were you happy ?
that ' s awesome . . hopefully they win again in the future !
did you enjoy it ?
i bet that was fun and relaxing
that sounds definitely terrifying ! did you figure out what it was ?
hmm . . i guess it is still july so it makes some sense at least ! did you ever confront them ?
that is great .
that is great , your studying paid off .
in what college did he go ?
oh , that ' s awesome ! i am glad he made it !
i suppose i have . why did you go to texas ?

i ' ve been to co ##zu ##mel . it was lots of fun
it is nice . school can be very exciting .
are they happy to go back to school ?
why were they fun
yeah , its not safe at all
yeah . i know that feeling . , although i had to buy my own .
i know . what kind of car was it
parents can be awesome sometimes . do you still play baseball ?
who ' s your favorite team ?
that ##s a great way to start
good luck going forward
why would you do that
i guess we all were though
i ' m sorry to hear that . losing family is always tough
i recently lost my grandmother . i thought i wouldn ' t get through it at all .
what did you get
i understand , time is important
that ' s awesome . was he the first in your family ?
did he get a god job ?
wa ##o , how did you felt ? did you work hard in that project ?
i ##w ##hat was your project about ? it was for school or something ?
where did you guys go ?
that ' s cool ! i thought they ' d only be around for halloween .
i hope you get it also ! what type of position is it ?
that ' s great ! how soon until you hear back ?
well . . . i put myself in your place and i admire you because it is something very emotionally tense
now you must take the correct ##ive so that it does not happen to you anymore
oh no . what happened ? !
i haven ' t tried uber for important places . not i know to be weary . so sorry to hear that .
oh no . did you lose your job then ?
maybe they can put you in a different department .
oh wow . are you a parent ?
you must be proud .
that ' s great !
that is a real blessing . being debt free is gonna be sweet !
i ' m glad to hear that . if you can get through that , you can get through anything together .
what matters is that you both learned from it .
oh wow . that is not something you hear everyday !
your friend must really like the woman .
i ' m sure you are going to miss her .
will you be able to communicate through social media ?
what situation ?
oh wow . kid is crazy !
oh man , that must be a horrible feeling .
there is always next year champ . im sure you ' ll try harder next time .
that ' s so bad . you must be feeling bad
i am surprised at their behavior . did you ask for a ref ##und ?
that is quite an achievement ! how did you do it ?
i bet their were struggles and you learned a lot . do you have any tips for me ?
that ' s exciting ! how old is she ?
oh my god . she ' s so little . i hope she ' ll enjoy it .
oh no , that ' s awful . when did this happen ?
i hope the worst didn ' t happen to them , that ' s so sad .
wow that ' s really nice . are you going to wear it ?
it must ' ve been a great guy .
wow nice ! what are you going to do with it ?
it is a lot of money . take your time deciding on what to do with it .
that ' s good news . is her cat micro ##chi ##pped ?
how long has the cat been missing ?
i bet that was scary ! did you like it ?
were you ever scared ?
are you ok ?
is your vehicle damaged ?
did you try to find who it belonged to ?
i understand , i hope you do something special with it then ! it ' s always exciting to get a little extra cash , even only $ 20 .
oh no ! are they even allowed to do that ?
that really sucks . i hate how employers expect us to work to death .
oh wow . glad that person helped you out there .
glad to hear there ' s still some good people out there .
was that difficult ? and is it your extended family , or your immediate family ?
i know that can be really tough . sometimes , though , it can strengthen communication - - hopefully they ' ve been able to visit ?
that sounds kind of suspicious .
oh no . did anything happen ?
how do you respond to the girls who are hitting on you ?
seems like you might be enjoying the attention .
how come ?
that ' s definitely concern . is there no more room for advancement at your current job ?
i hate to say it but , i think that ship has sailed . she ' s either dead or not your girlfriend anymore .
women , amir ##ite ?
oh no . i ' m so sorry to hear that and glad people at your church are there for you .
ha ##ha ##ha must be some really great cooke ##rs . how many kids do you have ?
that is so tough . i always feel bad when people have a hard time con ##ce ##iving because it was so easy for me .
i have 4 kids . i wish you all the best of luck and will pray for you . kids are so much fun . mine are all almost grown now .
that sounds very exciting - - if nerve ##wr ##ack ##ing ! how did it go for him ? ( and you ; - ) )
that is the * best * feeling seeing hard work pay off ! you much have been so happy for and proud of him !
oh no what kind of damage was done ?
did you tell her ? she may want you to go ahead and get it fixed .
must ' ve felt really nos ##tal ##gic .
do you get to see your mom often ?
that sucks . if it makes you feel even slightly better , the dumb ##est , most im ##com ##pen ##t cow ##or ##ker i have makes more than me . . . because you know . . ne ##pot ##ism .
yeah , its in ##fur ##iating .
oh no . i ' m so sorry .
i hope time will heal , and they don ' t lose hope .
why did you cheat on her ?
sometimes , it feels good to get revenge
how did you get the raise ?
what did you do that got you the promotion ?
that ##s great it always nice to be encourage . really like it when my co workers do it
glad to hear it .
you are such a nice person . hopefully you helped .
that is a bum ##mer . on the bright side you probably won ' t do that again !
that is awesome ! it is nice to know people can be fair !
sounds terrible , how did she get in the accident ?
what did she say after waking up ?
that ' s awkward where was it ?
from what you have told i can ##t go there what else did you see
are you sick ? what happened ?
that ' s terrible . i hope you get some rest .
that sounds like a happy homecoming ! or was it bitter ##sw ##eet ?
that ' s a great feeling . knowing you * can * go home again ; - ) hopefully they can come visit you , too !
oh that ' s nice ! most people don ' t adopt older dogs
mostly medical . but , also that you most likely won ' t have long to make a bond , play , etc . it would be mostly care
oh no . did you explain it to him ?
you ' ll be more careful next time . everyone makes mistakes .
why do you usually bring him along ?
how far away was it ?
oh man ! i ' m so sorry ! is there any part of the season you can still enjoy ?
do your parents feel terrible about that ? ( not that you want them to . . . . i just imagine they ' d be pretty devastated to know that ' s why a holiday was ruined for you . ) on the other hand - - i love new years !
why did he lie ?
what did he say for the reason ?
why is she the love of your life ?
how does she complete you ?
were you scared ?
what movies do you enjoy instead ?
that is nice of her , did you have fun ?
who was all there ?
o ##oo ##h really do ghosts exist
i used to but nowadays i don ' t what else
who won instead ?
did you bet on the game ?
that is amazing ! i went to college for a few years , never ended up graduating .
i studied hard for a while , but in the end it was just too much fun to party every weekend .
that isn ' t nice .
you should not do that anymore .
can you re ##take it ?
that ' s too bad . all you can do is try harder next time .
did you say something ?
did you say anything to the clerk ?
did you say something to the clerk ?
was there damage ?
was there anyone else around ?
did it turn out ok ?
what was the puzzle of ?
ha ##ha ##ha i can see ho ##e students laughed at you
ah ##w that was good
what about 3 ?
i have never been to asia .
something wrong with your meal or what
can you kick an innocent dog for nothing
that isn ' t very nice .
what about 4 ?
were you afraid or thrilled or both ?
were you in the water ?
that is terrible news .
how did you do it ?
that is wonderful ! i actually won the lottery once myself and it changed my life for a bit .
oh no ! that is terrible . i didn ' t give anyone any money either .
that must be a good feeling .
i use to go to church when i was little .
was it something that you could ignore ?
what did you do ?
that sucks . i am sorry for your loss .
maybe you should get a new one .
happiness comes and goes . it could change at any time .
as long as you take care of it , and use it the right way it will last you forever .
oh , that does not seem very nice .
yes , she and i have a bond that will be un ##break ##able .
why did you think that ?
what makes you qualified ?
oh no ! i did that last month . i still feel bad . get them a gift to say sorry .
give him a call too . it is a bit more personal .
i always try and order my food and get it delivered .
there a bunch of apps that let you buy food online , you should check it out !
that is a great idea for when emergencies happen !
yes , that is a smart plan . knowing that we cannot fore ##see the future , it is a good idea to be prepared .
oh no , where to ? that is hard .
oh no , where to ? that is hard .
well , at least there is sand !
why is that ? are you scared of something in the water ?
i was pleased and shocked at the same time , i will take it !
oh no ! i ' m so sorry !
that is not fun . hopefully it will not be too hard .
i expect that too , but it is not always the case .
yes , you do . you can do it !
that ' s great to hear . did you have to wait a long time to get it ?
oh , well i am very happy for you . i bet you were celebrating when you heard the good news !
after the interview was over i though it went very well . i am so confident i will get the job any day now !
that ' s awesome ! i love dog sitting no matter the occasion !
that sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise !
awesome ! i ' ve never been able to sit that long , so getting really good at video games is hard for me
that ' s neat . i wish i had your motivation for . . . well . . . everything else in life .
what is that ?
nice , how much did you get for it ?
that is so thoughtful of him , did you guys catch a ball ?
i am sure it was ! : )
tell me more about this
but i would less satisfied
tell him to get out and do something ! that must be frustrating .
its hard being a parent . . . but i am sure you are doing it right !
i love peruvian food ! what did you make ?
that green sauce with the ci ##lan ##tro and the ja ##le ##pen ##os is the best ! what is lo ##mo ?
yu ##m ! i have all the ingredients for the chicken , i might make that now instead of the bb ##q chicken , thanks for the idea .
oh wow , sorry to hear , that was really rude of her .
some people can take things so far . i hate it when they do that .
i am the type of person that gets what i have to buy and get out of the store .
proud parent right , do you miss her during the year ?
one day my child will make me proud like that
that ##s a lot of kids , god bless
going good . . . what ' s up with you .
so how did you do ? did the hard work pay off for you ?
holy cow . i hate when that happens . it happens a lot here since i live near the ocean . how did it end up ?
wow , how lucky . how did you end up thanking that person ?
where are you moving to ?
i love california .
cool who were they up against ?
nice !
why would you do that
i am not sure i get it
i love it when teachers are down to earth and easy to get along with . what did you like most about him ?
that ' s pretty cool . do you guys still keep in touch ?
sorry to hear that . i hope you ' ve had good teachers since then .
i ' m sorry to hear that . did something happen to make you miss them ?
oh no ! that is hard , i have the same issue . how far away did you move ?
om ##g ! i am the same way . . . i always end up putting my list down while shopping . where are you going ?
that ##s so kind of them !
oh man , i ' m sorry to hear that ! we all make mistakes though , so it ' s okay . don ' t be hard on yours ##le ##f
it ' s okay though , i ' m sure you learned from your mistake
i know how you feel . i ' m sorry to hear you ' re going through this . i just got food stamps so i can buy food for me and my son
i encourage you to apply for it no matter what
its a good time to jo ##g right now in the morning . good for you !
i know it does i am right in fl ! i don ##t jo ##g , i work out but running isn ##t my thing .
what kind of risk are you taking ?
yi ##kes , that ' s stress ##ful . how big is the family ?
i am so sorry . you must be heart ##broken .
how long was he part of your life ?
what did you do ?
did the dog bark at him ?
that sounds terrible . sorry to hear that . what exactly happened ?
that ' s the worst , when you personally know someone that treated you badly . i hope things turn out better for you .
oh no . . are you upset ?
aw ##h that ##s good it turned out well after ##all
yeah , i think most people feel that way , but it ' s still a valid feeling . how did it end up ?
that ' s great to hear ! did you have any cool teachers or make any new friends ?
i bet that was a little scary
oh well , i am sure most people forgot about it quickly
that ##s awesome ! im glad you persisted because that is so important these days , not being able to swim is a real danger !
yes , sounds like your doing a great job with the little guy !
oh no , did it take you a long time to figure out what the issue was ?
dogs can be a little sq ##ue ##ami ##sh when it comes to that sort of thing . i wouldn ' t feel bad , it could happen to anyone !
i know you are over the moon . what did you have ?
enjoy every minute with him . time goes fast when they are little .
that is horrible , so sad .
yes , fire prevention shouldn ' t be that hard .
wow ! i ' m so en ##vious ! how long ago did you buy it ?
makes sense . when you know what you want , you should go for it . well , i ' m happy for you . i ' m far away from being able to do that .
i bet you had a wonderful time together
how fun ! where did you guys go ?
i bet
that is good to hear , less weight the better
why would you do that
the loud roar ##s also make my dog shake and run to the basement
my dog never used to do that , it was only just recently that he started doing that .
oh no , was an ##oy ##one hurt ?
that is good news , i hope your car is ok .
you must have been so proud of their hard work .
was it a large graduating class ?
wow , i am glad you got help , that could have been a lot worse
that is so sweet of him , those are the people we need more of in the world
how was the experience ?
it was good you got over the fear , do you ride roller coaster ##s more now ?
oh my go ##sh , that ' s terrible . how did that happen
that ' s one of my worst fears when i drive to my girlfriend ' s parents ' house . so everything ended up being okay , though ?
what do you think your score was ?
ah that ##s a good score . when i took the l ##sat ##s about 15 - 16 years ago i received a 156 i believe . where do you hope to go to school ?
good luck !
i too was surprised . to leave the team again sort of upset me .
he is a legend in the making
i feel the same way . the times you spend with family should be cher ##ished forever .
i agree , be grateful for those in your life because they help you become a better person .
congratulations ? how much did you win ?
wow . now you can spoil yourself
he already left for the lakers .
he technically is from akron not cleveland .
that is sweet of him , marriage can be tough at first , so at least he is trying
that is true , marriage is great in a va ##cc ##u ##um , but life pops the bag sometimes
was it a long campaign ?
i bet it did
why is that ?
le ##bron isn ##t a saint though
how did you do ?
were you able to re ##take it ?
that is great , did you spend it on anything cool ?
that is smart as well , future you will appreciate that !
i am happy that you have someone to share your life with .
keep the faith that it will continue .
that ' s seriously impressive . sounds like a lot of work , though . hope it all works out . are you nervous ?
well , you sound confident . and applying and getting in is one of the tough ##est steps , so i ' m sure you ' ll do fine .
wow . that is great . not everyone can say that .
most struggle in their first year . that is amazing that you did so well .
i am an older student too so i hope things go well for me in school .
oh no , did the relative say what happened ? that sounds fish ##y .
it ' s an easy mistake to make , we ' re supposed to trust family , you know ?
that ##s great . i love taking the kids to disney ##world . what do you want to see most ?
ye ##a you won ##t be disappointed . its wonderful there .
i am sure you were happy
all that hard work was worth it i am sure
making a change can be hard . did you take the offer ?
it ' s always best to do nothing if your not sure .
were you able to do any extra credit to bring up the grade ?
that stink ##s . there ' s always next time !
oh , very interesting . i ' m not a fan of the owner either . why do you feel that way , though ?
that ' s a fair point . but le ##bron james is different , and probably seeks to try to really control the team he is on , so that can be difficult too
how long have you two known each ##oth ##er ?
i think you just need to give it time . hopefully she will come around .
what were you thinking ? have you been thinking it over for a long time ?
was she keeping him in her classroom ? i can see how that can be a lot of work .
that ' s nice . hard to find nowadays .
i know . i wish things were better !
i do too honestly , i used to play all these fun games with our neighbors late summer nights , it was amazing , but i took it for granted
i hear you there , that is the worst part !
i remember those games too . what kinds did you play ? my favorite was flashlight tag .
ghost in the graveyard was a blast ! i can ' t believe i forgot that one . it sounds like we both had great childhood ##s .
i get that , i am not sure how some of these people can afford the places they go !
yeah , that is not me at all , i barely post anything to people online
how exciting for you . what kind of car is it ?
that was so generous of them .
that is not nice ! people do that all the time as long as the person they tell is closer to them
everyone believes that of course , but i believe you , people make mistakes
u ##gh i remember those days ! all the shopping , making sure to look good for the first day ! good times
me too , i am looking forward to winter and christmas , much better in my opinion !
congratulations . marry her
then maybe you should cheat .
i am sure you are , that sounds bad
there are just bad people out there
that takes a lot of strength to be able to do that . a lot of people would just break down instead of trying to help however they can .
good for you , i ' m sure your dad is so very thankful for you .
yi ##kes , did anything out of the ordinary happen ?
that is weird , sorry to hear that , paying more money is never fun at all
wow that ' s awesome .
why so surprised >
i know exactly what you mean .
it makes it hard to communicate though .
i am sorry to hear that , how did it end between you ?
that makes sense , sometimes things are just not meant to be
that is no good , i am sorry that happened to you
it happens i suppose , maybe there is some sort of ref ##und policy where you bought it from
wow ! why do people have to be violent . . . u ##gh
right me either . its too bad but glad you are thinking right !
oh no . not another le ##bron story .
i know . he is a great player though .
that ##s nice .
sorry to hear that .
where are you headed to ?
oh , well that sounds like it will be a ton of fun , i hope all goes well !
oh no ! how old were you at the time ?
that ' s like a bad dream scenario . better to be a little kid though , even if kids are mean .
please don ' t care about those people . try to be true to yourself . world will recognize you one day .
exactly . you ' re right . ignore them .
have you been married a long time ?
i know that had to hurt . but forgive her and let her make it up to you .
dad ##s can be strange like that sometimes . was he trying to be malicious about it , or just having fun ?
what did he used to do ?
why did things end between you ?
oh , yeah i understand that , it is the same way with my girlfriend now
i was just saying the same thing .
i ' m only 34 and a lot of my old friend are dead .
was your previous neighbor good at least ?
ah , well at least you can only meet or exceed expectations !
why did it make you feel awkward ?
oh , well i am sure the date was just happy you were there !
that ' s a shame - i ' m glad that you ' ve got friends now though . why was that ?
i th ##ik ##n lots of people are shy until they find where they belong .
i bet you did , did you want a boy instead of a girl ?
that is a good minds ##et , i wish you the best of luck with that !
how did it happen ?
how , did you get into trouble ?
i understand that , he seemed to seal his own fate there , but still sad
potentially , he seemed a bit dead ##set , but we do not know too much all in all
how much do they run ?
damn . . how times have changed . .
was it rose ##anne ?
me too . what show are you talking about ?
that can be a hard situation to deal with . any chance of moving ?
good for you . just hang on best you can until your in a better place .
aw ##w , that is so sweet ! i ' m sure you were very happy
oh yeah , definitely ! she seems like a very good girlfriend to do that for you . sounds like y ' all have a good future ahead .
oh no . . . maybe you can get it fixed asa ##p so no one will be upset ?
i am sure it was glad its fixed
how does it hold up now ?
well that is good , that seems rare !
the results for what ?
well , best of luck , i am sure you did awesome !
childhood is a boon and it never be taken again . but everyone wishes to do so .
me too . try to spend time with kids . we can get into their life for sometime .
well there ##s only one way to find out !
ye ##a , everyone probably does at one point or another .
oh no ! i would have too . did you find him ?
oh . . . interesting . a hole under the fence ? i ' m sorry to hear that .
that ##s amazing . . im happy for him too . . i bet you are proud
that ##s to be expected but you seem like a caring person
wow , that ' s terrifying . get really big ? did it
that is crazy lucky . well , i ' m glad everything ended up okay .

i am sure it wasn ##t
ha ##h . . . i have a teenage sister . i can agree . but they can have their good moments . i hope for the best for you .
with the way you sound , i ' m sure you ' ll have the patience and the wisdom to raise her the right way through the teenage years anyway .

that ' s good . i am glad it was a happy ending .
i know you ' re not asking for advice but . . . don ##t . just don ##t .

ee ##k ! i hate spiders ! did you kill it ?
oh no ! that ' s too bad . now you will have to keep an eye out for it !
did it go well for you then ?
it ' s great when it works out that way , i hate presenting .
you should take it somewhere then
you need to save up then
did he give you tips for getting the best deal ?
that ' s really sweet , i ' m happy for you
i feel that , sometimes i feel lucky to survive single days !
why this one in particular ?
that is great , which one ?
when do you start ?
so what happened ?
congratulations !
i am glad to hear that , it seems like a lot of work
that is w ##ht i have heard , i hope it is that way for me
it can happen . were you better prepared for the next one ?
it can be a hard lesson to learn but will make you a better student .
my cousin bought a really pretty shirt that i had been wanting
no i can but i didn ' t want her to have it and not me .
no i can but i didn ' t want her to have it and not me .
i understand . . i wish life could be ea ##iser ! im sorry . . what ##s going on ?
sounds like a lot of stress . . . i hope things change for you very soon !
oh no , i hope you feel better soon . do you want to talk about it ?
i ' m so sorry . have you tried reading rainbow bridge , that could provide some comfort .
wouldn ##t that be cool and your best ##fr ##ien ##d would be kevin
yu ##p
why is that ?
what did she do for your birthday ?
i understand that completely , i still have a bit of time to wait
i get that , sometimes it is not in the cards though
did you get in ?
when do you start ?
that is nice of him , that is a good dad right there !
oh , i am sorry to hear that he passed away . . .
how do they help
they sound like good people
me too , i dislike heat but i love the leisure
me too , that made summer great as a kid !
that is good you met your girlfriend , where did you meet ?
where did you go to college .
nothing wrong with that .
no , only one extra day isn ' t bad .
is that a real thing ?
wow . the first one is so old now .
that ' s amazing ! how much did you win and what did you buy with it ?
smart move ! good for you for deciding to use it res ##pon ##si ##bly .
that ' s so sweet ! always a special moment , how old is she ?
i bet you are so proud !
i can understand that . my husband went to a friends to work on his car . i ' m home with 5 kids !
ha ha ! no loneliness here . i think the biggest worry is cr ##azi ##ness .
oh how sad , how did you lose your car ? . public transportation is not every one ' s cup of tea . .
you guy ' s will get back everything you have lost . it is difficult for travel as you said
oh no , that is unfortunate . are you alright ?
wow , you might just have bad luck
i would just take an uber from now on if i were you .
that ##s sounds so delicious . how did it turn out ?
did everyone else enjoy your new found passion for cooking ?
that ' s always a great holiday . what did you do to celebrate ?
sounds like a great time ! did you celebrate with family or friends ?
i ' m super bum ##med out . i worked really hard for this promotion and i ended up not getting it .
i ' m not sure , my boss won ' t return my request for a meeting emails .
i ' m excited personally , i guess you have to like your school and what you ' re studying .
i hate writing papers too . that ' s why i am an engineering major . lo ##l its still pretty hard though .
i bet you are excited for that
yeah , it ' s always hard to leave in those situations . are you flying to see her ?
i live near the beach , too ! it really is great . although i ' ve been out of town for a while , so i haven ' t been to it yet this summer . i ' m glad you got to go there .
only thing i ' m not wild about is dealing with cleaning up afterwards .
why weren ' t you able to do it ?
oh man that sucks , do you feel bad about it ?
i ' m sure if you apologize he ' ll understand at least a little . were you just really busy or something ?
sometimes people say things they don ' t mean when their angry . maybe you should just let it go .
well , you both have the same blood , so i would advise just to let by ##gon ##es be by ##gon ##es .
that ##s awesome , love the positive vibe ##s . good for you !
good paying job and keeps you active !
whoa . . . that ' s awesome . i love hearing that . can you tell me about them ?
absolutely . i ' m glad you ' re experiencing that . me on the other hand , i ' d be worried that i wasn ' t good enough for them . but i ' m sure things will work out for you .
yes it is . . . when can you see her again ?
well i hope you two get to spend a lot of time together when she comes up
that sounds like trouble . what exactly is going on ?
dan ##g ! i ' m not a parent , but i have siblings who have done the same ( and of course i ' ve done it to my parents , too ) . any idea what you ' re going to do ?
well then it ' s time to dominate . lo ##l
i ' m working now . enjoy your own time and also be responsible to your juniors .
oh my go ##sh ! congratulations !
you must be excited !
that ' s great . i have a dog i rescued ( she was a stray , not from a shelter )
5 years now . i ' ve also got a snake i ' ve had for ~ 15 years
isn ' t that illegal ?
that is a tough situation .
sorry . what ' s sec ?
ah i see . when will the match be ?
wow cong ##rat ##s . how long will it take you to complete the upgrades ?
well that still sounds great .
will be a game change ##r .
did the warriors get a replacement ?
oh what happened ?
they definitely surprised you then !
i hate when that happens ! were you able to get a credit for it ?
that ' s too bad . that is a big difference .
do you like dogs ?
they are so loyal . how long did you sit the dog ?
wow that ##s great , i hope you are able to do that
hopefully she is in good health !
what happened ? i don ' t know of this news .
oh my god . is he in a position of power ?
that is terrible . did they break up ?
yes , why did he do that ?
how nice of them
maybe just good people
have you watched the dog before ?
glad you had fun . what breed is it ?
best place to find one is online !
well you have to keep trying . don ##t give up
yes , i was happy he left .
i don ' t think he will .
i am fortunate enough to live close to mm ##y family so if they need something i can be there .
we may not be able to help them in the way we want to all the time but i am sure your mom knows you care a lot .
that ' s really good . no regrets then .
it ' s good that you got to spend as much time as you could . you ' ll always have those memories .
you gonna go on a date ?
is it totally blind or have you met before ?
that ' s a good kid . pretty amazing a 70s car is still going around .
i definitely need to learn how to take care of cars .
wow ! that is impressive ! did you see it happen ?
i bet that was very frightening for you .
wow . how was it ?
well , you definitely will not be going on one again any time soon .
oh that must have been very exciting !
ha ##ha that ' s how a lot of exciting events happen especially when you ' re really into it
what game did you watch last night ?
oh okay what teams were playing
has she been born yet ?
wonderful , cong ##rat ##s
was there something that she had done in the past that made you think she wouldn ' t ?
maybe if you start off with a small extension , you can see how it works before you go with a longer one , kind of like increasing a credit card ' s limit .
have you lied about something like that before ?
i ' m sorry , that must suck to get caught in a lie like that .
how come ?
ah ye ##a , i guess he hasn ' t yet .
what are you waiting for to get one ?
ok then , go get one and stop complaining .
now is a good time to get to know them . it is surprising if they don ' t know you well though .
that is great . i love hanging out with kids
yes . it is very end ##earing . our family are the first people we experience in life .
ah you are a soft ##y for the kids i see .
that ' s sad . i miss most of my childhood friends as well . my best friend actually moved to korea when i was 13 .
he ' s half korean , half white . his mom is from korea and his dad works for the military , so they decided to move out there .
definitely . if you can mo ##tiv ##ate and get on a schedule yourself , you can save a lot of money .
how long have you been training ?
what ' s the position ? are you going to apply for it ?
i ' ll keep my fingers crossed that you do , it sounds like that is your calling !
oh wow , what do you plan to do ?
good luck
are you sure about that ? i bet you are more than average .
i think you have some unique qualities to you !
what do you have planned ?
that sounds fun .
sad
that ##s horrible
why is that ?
get a dog .
i bet ! does your family do a large dinner as well ?
oh wow ! that sounds amazing ! my family usually does something relatively small . but i ' m ca ##jun so we put a unique twist on the food !
how did you fix it ?
what hotel ?
what did she say ?
that ##s awesome
how come ?
what were you out for ?
how many series did you watch ?
good to see your interest . i too fond of this movie .
where did he go ?
that is a long time .
that sounds like a good opportunity for you !
that is great . it will probably be good to get out of town for a bit too .
that is great . sometimes kids nowadays only seem to care about themselves .
it is a valuable thing to have compassion and you should be proud of your kids
me either , imagine being bitten by one .
the fact that they can kill you with their venom makes me uneasy .
what did he do ?
did he do it ?
oh really ? what makes you say that
what are those
is that good or bad ?
find a new room ##ate ?
that is a very lucky thing to have . do you have a wife and kids ?
oh that is great , i have a lot of siblings as well . i love them all !
how come ?
i have never been there but i have heard that before too . i am sorry you have to deal with that .
that is good , chance favors those who are prepared .
do you take any medici ##ation ?
i am glad they are healthy
i do not just a cat
that sounds great ! i wish i had a truck , they ' re so useful . does everyone ask you to help them move ?
i usually hear that that is one of the problems with having a truck lo ##l , always being the first people call to help . do you like it better than a car ?
that sounds interesting . how far are you moving ?
oh wow that is far . are you moving for a job ?
i am sorry , that sounds rough
i have been there too , very lonely
i ' m sorry to hear that . what made them think it was you ?
it ' s unfortunate that they would take their word over yours . it shows how little they knew you .
i bet ! please tell me you passed it !
wow , you must be so proud of yourself ! good job !
i love to be able to help people when i can also .
i understand what you mean . i feel like a better person and know i have accomplished something by making them feel better also .
i know the feeling . i wish we could take away the pain for our kids .
oh my ! i have never heard that before . i hate feeling that powerless but it is bound to happen many more times unfortunately
that sounds shady . did it ever get worked out ?
that is very disco ##ura ##ging . i am sorry you have to deal with that stress .
oh that is terrible ! kids are so mean ! what did you do ?
i hope that it only gets better .
what happened to make it that way
yeah that sucks , i have gone through that too
yes , it ' s hard to see people you know and care about struggling . are they doing better ?
that ' s great to hear ! i hope it stays that way and what ##eer troubles they had are subsided
that ' s great ! are you getting better at driving ?
are you going to buy a car ?
that ##s good to hear and do
i hate being late
how did you do ?
that ' s great ! cong ##rat ##s !
that is outstanding ! i bet you are excited !
that is great news and a lot to be proud of !
that is the greatest feeling in the world , to see them smiling .
i do . a child ' s laugh takes away all of life ' s stress .
i would be scared of that
i am not sure i am ever prepared
so why didn ' t you end up going ?
it happens to everyone , you ' ll feel better about it soon
wow , that can be stress ##ful , why were you happy ?
maybe she should have just quit ! but i hope the best for her in the future .
indeed , the future could be bright for her .
when are they ?
good luck
oh , did you lose it somewhere ?
good you got it back .
ah , that is no good ! why didn ' t you get to leave early ?
i know what that is like ! i hate being an adult sometimes !
wow cong ##rat ##s , how long have you worked there ?
that ##s cool
i feel like since the show , catfish ##ing has decreased a little bit . it ' s easy to determine when someone is using fake pictures .
i have and it didn ' t go so well for me . i hope your experience is !
no i didn ' t that ' s pretty awesome lo ##l . . . is that the show where celebrities get slim ##ed
that ' s cool i remember it was a big theme in nickelodeon . i ' d be so embarrassed if i was the losing family . . . but i ' m sure they all got paid so it was worth
was it a surprise ?
that is so cool . i bet you were happy !
i ' m so sorry , what happened ?
you must be missing here very much .
i saw that . it was pretty crazy !
what are your thoughts on that ?
wow that ##s a good feeling to have
you seem to have done a good job . cong ##rat ##s
well that sounds just wonderful ! what kind of entrepreneur are you ?
you ' ve sparked my curiosity on the last one ha ##ha !
did you try talking with your supervisor 1 on 1 ?
well i hope it works out for you .
that is really weird , did he actually knock the tree down and how thick was the tree ?
i wonder how long it would take him to kick through a large and wide tree .
nice did your friend give you a piece ?
cool what kind of pizza was it
that ' s awesome . you must be so proud of her !
she ' s a lucky lady !
that ' s a good goal ! i recommend online dating if you are trying to meet many different women !
i hear eh ##arm ##ony is pretty good . i have a couple friends who have had success with it .
i know the feeling of finish finals , but not with all a ' s . cong ##rat ##s buddy !
what are your plans afterwards ?
aw ##w ##w man that stink ##s ! i thought you two were going well .
yeah , but like 10 years of that committed time .
i agree , people who catfish need to get their priorities straight .
exactly , looks are not the only think that matter in this world .
i sure hope they say yes with a very low interest rate . will this be your first home ?
a very exciting and scary time of life . i remember it well .
fine , what did happen at last ?
good . is it a bike race ?
oh no . what happened ?
that ' s very kind of your manager .
being sick does stink at times . but at least your husband is there to assist when in need .
hopefully your kids also understand and aren ' t being a handful .
what was the game ? that happens to me all the time too , it ' s a treat to remember such great times .
i remember that show ! and the books ! but i had no idea there was a game !
have you asked them ?
they seem like not very nice people ! im sorry
what happened ?
how much ! sometimes things happen like that when you really need them !
wow , i hate when people feel like it ' s okay to waste other peoples time .
i ' m glad you are . you deserve to work for a company that values you and your time .
aw ##w , it ' s amazing how fast time flies and how quickly kids grow up .
i think like that with my kids . this sounds cl ##iche but it ' s so bitter ##sw ##eet .
did he lose it ?
boy , that ' s pretty messed up .
ou ##ch , seeing that news probably knocked your mood down hard .
yeah that is like half a year of rent for me . i would be liv ##id .
im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears ! its hard losing a parent .
yes we do i understand i lost both of my parents at 22
oh really ? is there any specific reason why ?
that ' s great ! do you have good days often ?
that ' s awesome ! gotta take credit for those genes ha ##ha
ha ##ha that ' s cool . . . always good to have the best of both worlds
i absolutely agree with that mind set ! pick something you ' re passionate about and do it with passion !
i ' m a fitness enthusiast myself , and you ' d be surprised how people even find reason to be negative about that .
about what exactly ?
what did he need it for ?
why do you hide it ?
why is that considered more attractive ?
it must have felt good to see him after such a long time .
a brothers bond is un ##break ##able . i ' m glad you guys got to spend some time together .
they are just kids , i think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer
: ) we have all being through the age . you will miss this stage when they finally grow to become adult
i think so ! that sounds like you worked so very hard for the company !
have you tried to talk to him ?
i am glad that it is
its nice to have things like that happen
where was it to ? ?
sounds awesome !
i ' ve never been in an eating contest ! how much je ##llo did you eat to win ?
what was the prize for winning ?
wow that ' s kind of cool .
yeah , those are rough when you are so hopeful about it .
yeah , hopefully your still looking for another internship .
i bet . . what did she pass away from ?
u ##gh that ##s terrible im sorry for your loss
i hope she is okay
i bet , good luck though
so many people are .
i totally agree . why do you think some people really like him though .
did you call to complain ?
less salt is always better than to much salt on food .
i ' m sorry to hear that . why would you considering putting it on hold ?
yeah , raising kids is very tough . i do hope everything works out for you . just find a way to keep your motivation up !
that is disappointing . i wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can h ##ype you up for it .
that is no good !
oh no . . . will you tell them ?
i think so its for the best
what job ? don ' t be discouraged if you don ' t get it though ! keep trying !
everything happens for a reason . when one door closes , another one opens !
wo ##ah ! that ' s super scary ! did it do anything to you ?
so creepy . . . i wouldn ' t be able to forget it either . . .
i am sorry to hear that
that isn ##t too far
what happened ?
is he okay now ?
that ##s a good bond how long have you been together ?
very adorable good for you guys
was that the only time you stole in your life ?
that was very cool of your dad . he taught you a lesson .
how is everything coming together ?
what did you want to happen exactly ?
that is sad
that makes me feel better
i bet that wasn ' t a great feeling .
i am assuming you did study hard for it right ?
that sucks ! have you been able to contact the bus company yet and get it back ?
oh no ! would your phone cost a lot to replace ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope it turns up .
wow that was a long time ago , i am sure that you regret it now and have learned from your mistake .
that ' s good that your friend wasn ' t affected by your actions too badly . if you guys moved on from it then it was a great learning opportunity !
its okay to stay at home
tv can be fun though
most kids are like that . i was definitely scared .
most of us do that too . kids over re ##acy to new environments
don ' t be . i am sure you are ready .
we all are .
awesome ! where are you going ! i am jealous !
no i am really jealous ! i have wanted to go there for the longest time . i am happy for you !
how that ##s cool .
hard work must pay off if you are seeing results ! cong ##rat ##s
that sucks to hear . i don ' t know too much about basketball , to be honest . was it really a big deal ?
i hear a lot of people say that , he must be real good . what team would you prefer to see him on ?
so , you are not anymore ?
did you graduate ?
why does he do that
i guess that ##s a reason
that is extremely lucky . it ' s nice to know there are still good people in the world .
wow . that sure saved you a lot of money on replacing a phone , too !
oh no really , that really sucks to hear . why were you not able to go ?
it is sad that you can not go , but you are making a good sacrifice to make sure your family will be able to survive . also you could use the alone time to do stuff you are not able to do with them around !
i am sorry , they are sweet animals
that is adorable
oh i hope she got better
well that ##s great news !
why did she break up ?
did she give you a reason why she didn ' t love you anymore ?
that ' s bad . i feel sorry for you
oh god . thanks . i feel care for you .
i felt the same way .
are they coming back soon ?
that is never a good thing to do
you will get through it
surely not , do you trust her .
then i wouldn ' t be worried , you can ' t live your life that way . if someone wants to cheat , they will find a way .
congratulations ! it must ' ve been a very happy day for you and your family .
i could imagine . i one day hope to experience that feeling .
oh ? how did you find him ?
oh he must be a good boy then or girl .
what happened to it ?
that stink ##s
why are you happy
that is nice to hear
i ' m so sorry to hear that .
i lost my grandmother last year . it is a rough thing to go through .
i am very sorry to hear about your loss . take you were very close .
i am sure she is in a better place now .
that is great to hear ! part of being successful is being confident , and you sure sound confident !
try to be confident but not overly entitled . there is a fine line between the two . cong ##rat ##s though if you get the job !
wow that must have been a terrifying experience . are you ok now ?
that is good that you escaped your accident with a minor injury . please take care of yourself in the future !
i am sure that will be fun
i bet you have a lot of good times
i could imagine ! how do you lose your dog ?
oh , wow ! those dogs are smart ! what did you change to make sure it doesn ' t happen again ?
wow im sorry to hear that . you still stay in contact ?
that ##s good
wow what did they say about skipping it ?
probably won ' t forgive him for a long time .
i bet that was stress ##ful
i am sure they did not mind doing that
how ' d he get out ?
oh man , i hope you weren ' t too hard on the kids .
wow that ##s awesome
sounds like you will be using that often
yes , but i will be sad when it ends .
i can ' t wait to find out the end of the series .
why ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
that ' s sad , did you move away from your parents ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . that would be hard .
did he just come back to you ?
that is pretty great ! my dog takes forever at time because he ' s playing with the neighbors dogs .
oh no , did you ever get caught
did you learn your lesson ?
i bet you were , poor pup
that is good to hear

hopefully you do go to college . i had fun but was stress ##ful .
i guess guys tend to do that
forward isn ##t always good
how old were you ? that can be dangerous , you hear stories of people falling in all the time .
i ' d be scared too !
i am sorry to hear that . have you tried looking for him .
what kind of dog do you have ?

wow , i sure beat he beat your butt , i bet you thought you had it in the bag , rig ##th ##t ?
ha ##ha ##ha that just goes to show ya , age is just a um ##ber ! '
for sure . trust is a key driver in having a good relationship with anyone . if you can ' t trust people then you will feel like you are alone a lot .
i agree with that . you should be able to trust people until they prove that they are un ##trust ##worthy .
how often do you eat it ?
oh wow
oh no . what happened ?
dogs can be bad . did he come home ?
we ' ve all been there . how did you do ?
that was nice . that doesn ##t always happen .
yeah that does make you feel good . but make sure it ' s a good charity .
i like those too especially when i don ' t want change anymore .
well dan ##g ! are you feeling alright ?
i had an experience like that before - one that i never want to live again . how is the driver ?
oh goodness , i bet that made you jealous !
wow ! i ' m glad it didn ' t es ##cala ##te to that point !
i bet that tasted good
oh well , at least it was something
it was a huge achievement when i graduated too . did you get good grades ?
nice . did you go onto to university ?
what do you think happened to it ?
that stink ##s
well that sounds really sad . how long was he missing for ?
did you ever find him ?
oh man ! i hate big storms too . was it as bad as a hurricane ?
well that ' s good . did you lose any shin ##gles from your roof ?
did you say something ?
wow that ##s cool
that ' s an awesome experience . how was the wedding ?
did they have an awesome catering service ? i am looking one for my wedding that is coming up
how do you like it so far
i am sure you will
yes . and in the closet too
my cousins used to play scary tricks on me . i hated that .
that ' s awesome ! were you invited to the wedding ?
do you know your co - worker very well ? what do you think you ' ll get them for a gift ?
how far away does she live ?
wow that is pretty cool of her to do .
i bet you were proud
that is great to hear
why don ##t you tell them to stop ?
ye ##a i co ##ud understand that
that is great news ! was he lost ?
that has definitely got to be a relief that he is back ! that is the best case scenario . hopefully , he never gets away again . make sure to check your fence !
oh wow . did you clean it up
wow that stink ##s
what happened to him ? did he run away ?
oh wow . did you put posters up all over the neighborhood to find him ?
oh wow cong ##rat ##s
i wish i could go back to get another degree . that ##s great that you were able to do that
thank god ! was your dog missing ?
ha ##ha dogs always want to go out and play .
oh no . what happened ?
hopefully , another position opens up ! i ' m so sorry to hear that .
that sounds so gross ! did you try any yourself ?
likewise ! i even too terrified to try su ##shi . it just looks so slim ##y .
wow , that is very annoying . what will you do clean the carpet ?
that is good idea .
summer was so much fun ! what did you usually do with your cousins ?
i used to be an outdoors ##y person myself . did you guys ever go to the pool ?
i ' m so sorry ! have you complained at all ?
that ' s unfortunate . i hope that something changes soon . it is detrimental to your health !
ha ##ha so what are they like now ?
i hope you taught them that it doesn ' t !
i ' ll be your friend
i used to have a had time making friends when i was younger .
that ##s great ! how old are you .
you ' re never too old to have fun ! don ' t ever think that . always stay a kid at heart
aw ##w ##w ##w ##w that ' s so sad to here . where did you rescue her from ?
i would have done the same thing ! who does that guy think he is ? i would ' ve tried kicking him back .
oh that ' s really bad !
that is just sad . people in education dying really sucks .
that ' s cool . what did you guys all do ?
i bed it was exciting just because of the idea of getting caught !
oh wow ! wasn ' t expecting that . but kissing your girlfriend is hardly something to be shame ##d of .
maybe someone is playing a trick on you
set a trap . or maybe just a camera
how ' s it going with that ?
ha ##ha ##ha i ' ve been that way too .
oh no ! i ' m so sorry !
no but i ' ve had my hours so reduced that it wasn ' t working going to work due to everything going to union due ##s and transportation .
oh , that ' s never any good . did the group see you do anything embarrassing ?
well , that does sure sound like a show . i bet they shared a bunch of laughs over those wr ##etched and foul far ##ts .
hm never tried baked salad . how ' d it go , ramsey ?
well , you get experience points on that . hopefully , the next dish is better .
it ' s been raining hard here in virginia too . did you get w ##his ##ked away in a flash flood ?
some days trapped inside the house aren ' t always bad . at least you don ' t have to think too hard on what to do .
that is good ! what work do you do there ?
must find some cool things while doing it .
that ' s horrible . did they divorce ?
of course ! betrayal is ho ##rri ##fying to go through . i hope he became a better man for it ?
that ' s so sweet .
was it for your birthday ?
i hope i work with nice people like that one day .
there is so much different kinds it can be da ##unt ##ing sometimes on where to find the good stuff .
oh wow . i would suggest using spot ##ify and then make a radio play ##list on your favorites artists . that is how i find newer but similar music .
sometimes it takes a while to really hon ##e into your preferences .
a + for creativity .
never ventured , nothing gained and all .
seems like things turned out for the better . what is she going to do with the winning ##s ?
sounds like the responsible thing to do . hopefully she gets a new one soon and her luck continues .
how exciting ! where is your friend originally from ?
so awesome ! has she ever been to america before ?
that is good stuff . i bet that made you feel good !
you are so much fun ! jogging gives off a pretty good feeling too !
i hate that too ! do you make him clean it up ?
that ' s a tough situation to be in . i would just take all his belongings to the dump and be done with it . maybe he can stay there too .
ye ##a , you can do whatever you want .
that ' s for sure . how long have you had your independence ?
really ? why ?
i don ' t like vacation ##s that make you feel like you are still at home . where do you live ?
aw ##w ##w ##w ##w , poor little dogg ##ie . did you end up helping the poor thing ?
that ' s good ! small dogs like that make excellent companions . do you plan on keeping him ?
wow , that ' s interesting . what do you do with it ?
oh no - well i am the opposite . i rescue bam ##bi and small cr ##itte ##rs : )
that ' s too bad to hear . what ' s wrong with her ?
that ' s incredibly awful . at least the surgery fixed the injury ( i assume ) . did the doctors say when she is going to wake up ?
think i ' ve done that , too . no regrets , my friend .
they are ta ##sty sins .
are they being loud and annoying like usual ?
u ##gh , well good think mine are still at summer camp .
what ' s game club
sounds like a fun club though . my school didn ' t have anything like that .
well congratulations ! what will you be doing at your new bill ##et ?
you managed to get a promotion , so you ' re obviously talented . i ' m sure you will do just fine and earn many more promotions .
oh no , how dare he ! doesn ' t he know that is forbidden
that ' s so sad : ( maybe he should buy you a substitute
that was nice of you
it could have been sentimental . like a gift from someone special
wow . how ' d that go ?
that must ' ve been em ##bara ##ssing . happens to us all .
me too ! i helped a guy with his immigration case and saved him from being deported . he ended up becoming a pastor .
he deserved it . he was fighting for his life .
that ' s too bad . what seems to be wrong with him ?
doesn ' t sound good at all . has anyone taken him to get it checked out ?
big mac ' s are heaven in your mouth .
i mean you can still go back for more after this . don ' t give up , bro .
i stayed at home - i hate trying to fight over that 50 % off pack of pencil ##s at staples . what did you do ?
sounds like a swell purchase . have you taught big brother alexa to say any mischievous phrases ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , what led you to this ?
ye ##a , you need to stay away from those , especially if you don ' t know who they are , your email should be able to block stuff like that , look in the settings .
why is that ?
oh wow , you must have a lot of responsibility there !
that sounds fun ! you must be really happy about it .
aw ##w ##w . . . how long have you had him ?
why didn ##t it work out ?
oh well that ' s good .
are you attending post secondary ?
that ' s awesome ! what are you and your kids taking ?
that ##s cool ! what band is it ?
fantastic ! that would be so fun !
that sounds great . was it a promotion or maybe a raise ?
oh i see . well that ##s all very exciting . if you keep working at it im sure you will continue to be successful . it will pay off .
o no ! that ' s a terrible thing to have happen or see .
was the person ok ?
oh ! what is it for ? just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interview ##ers : )
cool ! what industry is it in ? i hope you get the job !
what city are in right now ?
oh well , be carr ##ef ##ul . make sure nobody is following you .
oh wow . well are you going to use it ? why are you ashamed ?
why did you buy it then ?
wow that ' s awesome . congratulations
did you like the food ?
can you explain more ?
donate is good thing to do . great
that is so disgusting !
i probably would have done the same thing .
i am a teacher so i understand . you must be working well with him ! do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom ?
the amount of pride he will have in himself with speak volumes . let his new teachers know what works for him . you are his best advocate !
that is awesome ! what do you go to school for ?
well if you are doing so well , i wouldn ' t quit ! good luck !
how sweet . how is it now ?
it great that he has a good home then .
he must love his grand ##ki ##ds .
ah well , he raised your and your brother so he knows what he ##s doing .
don ' t feel bad , many people are experiencing the same feelings . try to focus on meeting new and interesting people !
have you tried online dating ? many of my friends have experienced success with apps like eh ##arm ##ony !
that ' s not fair . why didn ; t they split it up with more people .
that ' s terrible . maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done .
that sounds pretty ad ##mir ##able . what kind of animal ? dog ?
yeah , i ' m afraid to get a cat because you never know what kind of personality you ' ll get with them
that ##s very ad ##mir ##able .
enabling is pretty bad . people don ' t learn if someone is always saving them from every thing .
i ' m about to watch it ! please don ' t spoil it . i ' m excited for it , even though i ' ve only seen a couple of tv shows and movies based off of his books , and only read a couple of the actual books
yeah , i like a lot of the actors they ' ve got for that show , so i ' m really looking forward to it . might save it to bing ##e it though
did you ever come clean ?
that ' s good . i always like about not under ##stan ##fin ##g football when i meet a guy . it makes them feel good lo ##l
whoa ! that ' s incredible . what caused the change , finally ?
i ' ve heard about people doing that . . . man , it ' s incredible how much your diet can affect you . i ' m really happy for you guys .
it is wonderful to have a good parent . they really do shape their children for better or worse . i ' m so glad you have a great mother !
i know exactly how you feel . i have great parents as well and it makes me want to be the same kind of parent for my kids !
that ' s odd . . . usually buses are always on time . maybe the weather had something to do with it . i ' m sorry to hear that happened to you . all dried off now ?
glad to hear it . hopefully you didn ' t have any electronics with you . . . that would be my worst nightmare !
big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day . was it a pretty long day for you ?
ha ##ha i bet ! always great to have everyone together , though , really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life .
i am so sorry to hear that . i assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately ?
sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die , but that is why we need to really live while we are able . don ' t retreat . embrace everyone who is close to you .
that ##s so scary , do you believe in ghosts ?
hope it ' s a friendly one at least .
ha ##ha . makes it hard to take care of business , and you ' d think she ' d get the hint from the locked door ! i would have sat longer " just because . "
maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat !
you should put yourself out there and meet some new people . just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others !
it is . it isn ' t healthy to be by yourself for too long . humans are social creatures !
wow , no parent should ever abuse their children like that . did you or anyone do anything ?
ye ##a i totally understand where you ' re coming from . hopefully someone nearby was able to call cp ##s or law enforcement .
lo ##l , what a bum ##mer . what happened ?
well there you go , at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation ha ##ha !
where did this happen ?
oh wow , yeah that sounds gross ! i agree with the wasted food too . there are starving people all around the world !
oh no , why were they closed ?
im sorry , i know how much that stink ##s , like when you really really want chick ##fi ##la and its sunday . . .
why would you always get fake checks ? that would drive me crazy .
well that was a surprise i bet .
o really ? any specific reason for this fear ?
flying scares a lot of people but it ' s safer then driving over all .
i have to say that is a true blessing . i have a wonderful mother myself . why do you say she is a good mom ?
she sounds like a wonderful person .
oh really , cong ##rat ##s ! yes when your kids ac ##omp ##lish something it is very happy for us parents !
that ##s so cool , do you have any ot ##he children or just one ? when you have more they are very competitive
he could ##ve killed you !
i really hate bad drivers .
i know that can be hard . how long has it been since you ' ve been out with someone ?
yeah , al ##ot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up . i know there is someone out there for you , just stay positive and they will come your way !
that must of been no fun .
hopefully she doesn ' t do it again .
i ' m not too fond of them myself . why don ' t you like them ?
yeah , especially fire ants . those are nasty little bug ##gers .
sweet , was it a difficult test ?
ye ##a , same , it ' s nice to be out of school . all that learning pays off though !
ye ##a that is the worst . i don ' t understand how it can come ##out of here mouth
i hope you just walked away dude . nothing good can come of that . i bet you were furious .
well , that escalated quickly . i ' m hoping this is not real ?
: ( that is messed up , did he / she show any warning signs before their passing ? it ' s not your fault by the way .
did you hurt your self ?
that wasn ' t nice of them .
sorry for the bad news .
i know she will make it .
congratulations ! what are you doing to prepare for it ?
that sounds like a lot of fun . what kind of cake did you select ?
it probably stan ##k a lot too .
you probably should have moved with a shovel of something , instead of running over it
i am too ! i am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with russia . what makes him annoying to you ?
i know right ? doesn ' t seem right . especially with the whole russian interference with the election .
me too ! these kids in this house are driving me crazy . they need to get back on a schedule .
i think mine have two weeks left .
that must of been no fun .
did you have a flashlight ?
oh no . iv ##e only been once but it was great . what happened ?
that terrible . were you able to get a ref ##und ?
how old is she ?
why not send her to summer camp ?
what was it about ?
what did you spend it on ?
what movie was it ?
i have never seen it .
that would be scary ! can you imagine what the d ##m ##v is like ?
that would be an amazing neighbor ! i would be so worried !
that is great . everyone should be loyal to their spouse .
maybe you can renew your vows one day .
he must of been crazy .
yes , id he do it for money ?
good luck with that . do you found yourself con ##fort ##able in your new job ?
i understand
holy mo ##ly , that must ' ve been a very de ##pressing sight . did the police end up finding the cu ##lp ##rit ?
i do hope nothing of value was stolen . i would be frantic if someone stole my family heir ##lo ##oms .
the visit would be the best gift ever and the paint job a huge bonus .
how far did they have to travel ?
what job are you going to get ?
what did you use to do for work ?
i think he ann ##oys most people .
his t ##wee ##ts are rude and ill informed and he never apologize ##s for anything .
i bet you were starving ! did they say why they were so late ?
did you get it free ? i would be so annoyed !
aw man , i ' ve been there before . has anyone tried using it ?
that really sucks . fortunate to hear that no one mis ##used it though . they are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one .
wow , that sounds unique . what exactly do you sell ?
oh ! well du ##h , silly me . i thought it was food or something . do you sell other things too ?
did you call the police ?
they will find who did it .
is he unable to take care of himself now ?
how caring of you .
that sucks , did you still have fun ?
what did you bowl ?
she ann ##oys me as well ! she seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election .
yes , especially for all those emails they found on her private server . des ##pic ##able .
that is awesome ! what subject was it in ?
i sure hope that you did . statistics is tough !
i hear that , my friend . it ain ' t exactly easy living with mine , but ya gotta do it for love .
it has to be enough - that ' s the whole reason why we seek out a soul ##mate . i do hope things get better .
i love card games also .
yes i have won a few poker tournaments .
oh man , why are you even still sending him money ?
ah ##hh , so you ' re upset at your past self ? we all make mistakes , man , it ' s good . what we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be , but hind ##sight is twenty twenty .
so much for them being up front for you . man $ 300 for what that ##s a lot .
ye ##a construction zones are crazy , so often no ##oon ##es there !
that would be exciting ! what do you plan to do with your winning ##s ?
that could lead to a gambling problem ! i always run away with my winning ##s .
yes , i hate that so much . the sound of sc ##ree ##ching and crushing metal is trauma ##ti ##zing .
unfortunately , yes . i had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled . . .
smart move - it ' s always a swell idea to get ahead of work so that we can do the things we want to do in life .
yu ##p , i used to pro ##cr ##ast ##inate all the time , but i think i am getting better at doing things ahead of time . and it feels so much better to get trivial things out of the way .
aw man , that has to be rough . were you guys really close ?
that ' s even more sad ##den ##ing . did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral ?
did you return the socks ?
that is mean .
me too but it is still one more month of heat coming but it also means september is on the way .
why do you say that ?
i don ' t like 100 + degree days myself !
i like driving closer to the ground .
i could sure but i will be starting over on payments , i might look into it .
at the time it was a change and i like the ride of it , but i did not realize i would miss the sedan as much as i did .
what do you have against the ole water ##bu ##g ?
that is terrifying indeed ! i hoped you swat ##ted that beast with the biggest fly swat ##ter available .
congratulations . are you excited ?
you ' ll do fine . i look at new things as adventures .
that would be de ##pressing , did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you ?
maybe if you post to social media , a bunch of random strangers will show up .
ou ##ch , was it an unfair test or did he not study ?
ye ##a , hope he can make it up the rest of the year .
e ##w ##w ##w , throw that away asa ##p .
throw it in your neighbor ' s trash can . i ' m sure they would understand ?
what a nice gesture ! what did you get to eat after not eating for so long ?
what kind of topping ##s did it have on it ?
oh no ! what was it ?
yi ##kes ! i hope you didn ' t have any car damage .
i hate it when people laugh at me , it ' s so humiliating !
oh god , that ' s the worst part . the shame afterwards . . . .
ye ##a man , that ' s good karma !
me too . its always the worst when you are trying to get into the carp ##ool line .
that ' s awesome . i hope ro retire one day .
what are you going to do now ?
what diet do you want to do ?
make sure you drink water also .
i have never heard of an ed ##m , what is that ?
lo ##l - sounds like fun ! nothing better than nice hip ##pies !
what does a care ##gi ##ver do ?
oh , i see . your mom is an angel !
what happened to him ?
so sorry to hear that . i hope that the pain fades with time .
oh what a di ##sa ##point ##ment , well you can keep saving , does it hurts too much ?
oh ok i get it , well you just will have to save longer , thanks god its pain ##less !
i am sorry to hear that .
i hope you had fun with her .
same , i need someone else to watch horror movies with me .
ha ##ha ##ha , you are very adamant i see .
that is so sweet . i want a puppy . and a boyfriend .
why did you break up ?
oh i do too , they must have been having a bad day
yeah i guess so what did they do to you ?
oh lord , you might make me vomit right now !
you totally aren ' t sorry . you are being super gross ! lo ##l . t ##mi
that sucks . i ' ve been nearly broke too several times but thank god for family , right ?
what happened if you don ' t mind me asking ?
they are really nice cars ! have you driven one ?
they are nice looking cars and i have heard are great to off road in !
that ' s not cool . did you put your name on it ?
i ' m so sorry that happened to you , better luck next time .
oh no . why do you think that happened ?
maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time .
i feel you on that , man . i get nos ##tal ##gic all the time . what do you miss the most ?
ha ##ha , ye ##a , no one ever tells you how bad it really is . we get charged for every little thing .
when i was younger , but yes
was she okay ? couldn ##t have been that bad
woman lo ##l
yeah , i hate that . sometimes people will leave their carts right in the middle , blocking everyone while they walk off grabbing what they need . so annoying .
i guess they have never heard of a personal bubble .
i am not someone who likes that but i
i ' m sorry it submitted early . but i ' d love to hear why it ex ##cite ##s you ?
true ! thank you - it is very real
ou ##ch , did it make you late to work ?
that ' s great to know there are still good people in this world .
i bet ! could you see yourself walking around ?
i bet that brought back a lot of memories !
why ? are you from new york ?
nice , do you play football too ?
what kind of gamer ?
i love video games .
that was very mean of him .
did you call the police ?
that is great ! always nice to see a good dad for once
can you give me an example ?
what ' s the braves ?
okay cool , i ' m not that big into sports .
they must of been so proud .
who gave them to you ?
who got them for you ?
are you quit ##ting your job ?
that will be a nice change of pace ! do you have plans for retirement ?
i hate that too . have you ever noticed that ' s what they do in movies ?
i have seen them leave whole foods in movies . gross
i wish there would be , but i very much doubt that there will .
i do to , but there are so many unhappy people in the world and they seem to think they have to make everyone else around them unhappy .
oh nice , i don ' t really watch football .
i haven ' t really watched it on tv but my family watches it sometimes .
did you fix it ?
how many hours did you put into it .
i sadly have no musical skill . do you think you will ever become a musician ?
what part of being a musician appeals to you ?
life can be tough sometimes . it almost seems like you spend more time preparing for the unexpected than living life in the present . it ' s cruel sometimes
it ' s always good to have happiness even in times of worry and panic . so , i ' m glad you still have some optimism !
wow ! did you report him to the police ?
sounds like that person has boundary issues . my ex ' s brother did that bother and i quickly ni ##pped that behavior in the bud . good on you for stopping that . is he in too drugs or something or just entitled ?
om ##g . i was devastated i grew up listening to him .
i loved his song star ##fish & coffee when i was little .
what can you win ?
how much is a ticket ?
it was really sad . he was a really good artist .
that would be awesome . i bet it was a really great concert .
why did he not graduate ?
did he go to college ?
oh no , well i ' m sure you ' ll do okay if you just prepare really thoroughly .
i hope so too , good luck !
that ##s a bum ##mer . maybe you can take it to a repair shop .
im sure they can figure something out . they might be able to remove the hard ##drive to recover the photos .
oh my god ! have you posted everywhere and checked shelters ?
oh no ! did she have a micro ##chi ##p ?
that must be so frustrating .
yes it is . i would be furious !
im very sorry to hear that . hopefully it will get better with time .
im sure she is in a better place . looking down on you .
i hope you do well . what do you think ?
does the job come with more pay ?
good luck to you !
do you ever try to call the police ?
well do you try to catch them lo ##l ? that ##s insane we have a dog po ##op problem at my apartments
i would just throw the bottles back at them
oh yes , i bet the bosses love them too right ? that happens a lot . very unfair
oh gee ##z - work on your side hu ##stle and get out of there . i did a long time ago . hate those jobs !
you are very lucky . i have 4 children and i have been lucky also to have healthy children .
i know what you mean . i am always so sad when i see all of these sick children on tv .
i would be so happy if they could find a cure for cancer .
wow . can she handle all of that ?
that ##s awesome . she will do great in college .
that sounds awesome !
i ' m glad that worked out for you , it could have gone in a completely different way .
ya ##y you ! i hope your next project turns out just as good .
oh no that is so sad to hear ! i have one dog and two cats , so i totally understand what you are going through . . .
aw ##w what a cute name . hopefully you an your mom made up , and maybe you got / can get another pet .
oh no ! i know it stink ##s but maybe one day you can forgive her - i hope . . .
oh no , i hope it was for a good reason
oh man ! it ' s hard when those accidents happen .
that ' s great ! i hope it goes well for you !
good luck !
dan ##g , i would have been so upset too .
it would have sucked more if it was raining . hopefully you have some good vibe ##s come your way .
i bet . you guys were together for so long . is this for the best ?
well i am sorry to hear that . if you need anyone to talk to let me know .
was ? that almost makes it sound like you didn ##t graduate or something went wrong , did you graduate ?
nope , unfortunately not , i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out . what did you study ?
medicine and / or nursing , initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror , some of which still is ongoing so i didn ##t want to participate in that . what can one use a business management degree for ? do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work ?
oh no , im so sorry ! they probably already filled the position and it didn ##t have to do with you personally !
yeah ! people tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead .
sorry to hear that . did you have trouble getting the extra precautions ?
well , i hope everything turns out okay for you .
i have
ir ##ma last year
how much was it ?
wow , that ' s a lot , what type of vehicle ?
how many of them were te ##hre
what color were they ?
well , transportation is very important . take some old clothing and cut it up if you have to .
tissue is so expensive , it ' s unbelievable
i do as well , how long does it take you to do it ?
that makes sense , but i guess everyone needs food !
yeah ? who were they playing against ?
i think i remember watching it . how old were you then ?
it ' s a boon for everyone . great life period is childhood .
yeah , whenever i miss my childhood i try to spend the time with the kids . so we can feel better .
i know , but now we have another kind of football season coming up soon
me too , i am so excited , since the eagles just won last year !
why is that ?
that happens sometimes . maybe you should take a break
what kind of food do they serve ?
i do too , tn , but i can ' t think of a soul food place here .
cooke ##ville
its summer vacation . i hope you got enough sleep or it might be a long day for you .
oh ok i see . im sure he will want a nap later . hopefully that gives you time to rec ##har ##ge a little .
i ' m sorry to hear that . i lost mine recently also .
that must be hard .
i know what you mean . it ' s not safe to send your kids out now .
i have to take my kids to parks outside of our neighborhood .
i know that feeling , that is no fun , but at least they are learning !
that is good , that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money !
i ' m sorry to hear that . did you spend a lot of time with her ?
that ' s terrible . i hope she ' s at least at peace now .
i never really got into pokemon .
i tried to do the mobile game but i didn ' t get it lo ##l
oh really ? how much did you win ?
hey that is nothing to s ##nee ##ze at , i would take that in a heartbeat
really ? have you got a large family ?
but you are all very close knit then ?
that must be fun , it is so cute watching kids try to read books for some reason
yeah , kids are just so adorable , watching them learn in front of your eyes is an awesome pri ##vel ##ege
that ' s awesome . what was your major .
you ' ll do great . your parents must really b proud .
oh no . that may ruin the walls .
hopefully she learns her lesson .
what is it called ? i may tune in !
oh , i have hu ##lu , i need to look into that !
what is you job now ?
oh . well keep looking . you will find something soon .
that is really scary . hydro ##pl ##ani ##ng is something you can really do nothing about
it happens really quickly . you forget everything then .
oh , you ' re starting up again soon , too ? me too . i ' m excited and a little bit une ##x ##cite ##d . will be good to have a schedule , but worried about being able to do school and earn money to pay rent . what are you major ##ing in ?
hey , that ' s pretty cool ! i ' m major ##ing in social work . those both are close alternatives to social work that i gave some thought to . sometimes i think i should have done cr ##imi ##nology , but oh well . i hope you enjoy your semester .
have you grown out of it ?
well that ##s a good start
that is ob ##no ##xious , i would switch just to stick it to them
that is terrible , that is not a good way to keep people
glad for you . i have broken up with mine after 3 years of being together
it was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways . she said she was not feeling happy with me
i would be more than jealous , but maybe i am not super sane about that kind of thing
that is probably true , but the stories we hear do not help
i ' m sorry to hear that . did she pass away recently ?
yeah . it is difficult when you lose someone you ' re close to .
that is a perfect time to go , that is when i went as well
it sure did , it was the best vacation i have ever been on
was he just playing tricks on you , to get you to laugh ? or was he being malicious about it ?
yeah , sometimes dad ##s forget how young kids are and just do what they think is funny . my dad wasn ' t the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be . but he was still a good da
that is scary , i was in that position before , i do not know why they make it so difficult
still , school is about making mistakes and learning from them
nothing wrong with that , it ' s the unknown that scares us all .
i ' d try not to be too down on myself over it .
my daughters started back to school today .
it ' s good , but i ' m a little nervous for them . i know they ' ll be fine .
i agree on all terms , without family we don ##t mean much in the world
of course
that is not cool , i would cancel immediately
oh , yeah you should definitely cancel in that case
that ' s lucky ! did he get hurt from his shoes breaking mid game ?
oh no ! i hope it didn ' t effect his team too much .
that is pretty normal , so do i
those days will not ever come again , we have to live with it
who are we talking about ?
oh , i am sorry to hear that !
why is that ?
that is no fun , leave the kids at home for stuff like that !
yeah - is it a re ##boot of the old version from years ago ?
oh cool - i haven ' t played all of them , but did play ##the first one .
i ' m not familiar with that , tell me more .
that sounds like fun , which game platform ?
that is awesome , i am very much the opposite , hat is a great skill !
wow those are not easy to learn either , good job raising them !
oh , what happened ?
oh that ' s bad . i feel sorry for you .
small things like what ?
ah , well for some people , that is a very big thing !
that sure is a lot of savings
did you check e ##bay ? its cheaper te ##hre
how small is small ?
that ' s not bad . i want a 75 inch but i ' m settling at 55 for now lo ##l
why is that ?
oh , well i hope the tides turn for you soon !
when is the release date
just in time for the holidays , nintendo is smart
how did it go ?
cong ##rat ##s ! i bet that feels great !
oh , tell him not to feel nervous . he worked very hard indeed .
oh that ' s great ! good for you him !
oh no , what happened ?
that ' s not good . maybe they are trying to protect them better , but haven ' t figured out a good plan
wow that is not cool , why not tell your parents ?
ah okay , well that makes a big difference
i am excited for you
will you be playing it a lot ?
that is great , that is a dream come true for a lot of people !
i understand that , it can leave a large void , my mom used to be like that too
it can be hard . i went through that myself .
we have to deal with it and try to move on .
how good . i think you like it a lot
to me likewise i find it a super fun game
that ##s what the love and family bond i think
accepting . . but not in my case . . you are lucky i guess
notified of what ?
ah , that makes sense
that ' s always a bad thing about having to work with others . what kind of issues do they have ?
the worst kind . i bet they think they know what they need to do and get really annoyed when you try to help .
about what ?
i am sorry ? i do not understand
no ia ##m here dude
yeah me too ##o . then how was your day today ?
okay , i ' m feeling nos ##tal ##gic about my childhood .
it was a long time ago , but i still remember it well .
ok thank you bye
4
4
friends help us in difficult times , thank god we have them
i hope you overcome that situation with the help of your friends
that really sucks . . . did you tell them how that made you feel ?
i would tell them . . and if it happens a 2nd time then they aren ##t very good friends to have ! : /
oh wow ! that ' s great . did she say how it went ?
hired the same day though . . . she must have done really well , despite being nervous !
sounds like hard work has been paying off for you .
that is always a good feeling . i love when i am on top of things .
that ' s awesome .
i bet that warmed your heart . my old friends won ' t even drive across the city for me . we always meet downtown .
i went through that for like 5 years . ended up finally going and they ' ve made a lot of advances in comfort since i last went before that .
yeah , you should definitely bite the bullet ( metaphor ##ically ) . it ' ll only get worse from here if you don ' t do anything , and it probably won ' t be as bad as you worry .
that ##s great ! how many do you have ?
wonderful ! what kind of instruments do they play ?
are you better now ?
that ' s so nice to have someone to depend on .
that is so annoying . do you check the bag before arriving home at least ?
its the worst . i would complain to management . you can ##t be the only one it happens to .
i hope so too ! waiting for the call back is so nerve ##r wreck ##ing .
take your mind off of it and before you know it , you ' ll be filling out new hire paperwork !
the strength remains us the prayer , it helps us to get ahead
well . . . god is in the hands of your doctors
are you going to go out alone or with the family ? vacation ?
well , i hope you have a lot of fun in contact with nature
oh my god . that is ho ##rri ##fying .
i rescue animals , it ' s best not to let cats wander outside . so many bad things could happen .
yes ! that can happen around any bigger dog . we had a foster dog do it . it is horrible ! so sorry for your loss . i have lost many this past year . accidents happen .
you are not ! i let my cats outside but supervised . yes it ' s hard if they love it . you can get a special cat fence : )
i can understand that . was there a reason one color was chosen for her and another for you ?
sounds like you wanted to be the same as your cousin and not set apart . it may seem trivial now , but i know it wasn ' t trivial to you at the time .
it must be hard being apart . just know he will return a better person most likely .
he will need your support when he gets back . just stay strong and know its for the best .
wonderful ! congratulations ! what are you going in too college for ?
you sure can ! hard work is required to get something of value .
: ( i am so sorry to hear that . . . how old was she ?
she lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind . i hope you feel better soon . . .
it really is bad everywhere and the bullying policies don ' t help .
yes it is . it makes me want to homes ##cho ##ol .
wow ! had she ever won before ?
sometimes those things happen just when we need them . it would be nice if they happened for extra money too ! lo ##l
you definitely can ! what are your plans ?
that ' s true . i wish you the best of luck !
i cong ##rat ##ulate you on your children . . . . that says a lot about you as a father o mother
we need good parents , that will make the world more human
mistakes happen but it ' s good you are learning from it . we all make mistakes
maybe it will be just what you need though . time to really concentrate and learn and grow within yourself as an individual : ) maybe you will have a nice romance too
that is very kind of you . you should take it to the vet for a check up .
i takes a special kind of person to do what you are doing . im sure that dog is already much happier in your care .
oh no . . . yi ##kes have you told your friend yet ?
well that ##s good of you ! too bad it happened : / but glad she ##s not upset
that ' s nice to hear ! what ' s going on ?
wow . those are 2 fantastic news !
sounds like you have a wonderful family . some people take it for granted .
i ' ve had those experiences as well . my family is also very precious to me .
the weird ##est thing . . . it sucks when you don ##t know what ##s causing it . has she been to an eye doctor or just a general dr ?
sounds like a good idea i hope her pain goes away asa ##p !
you can . it will take some persistence . how ' s it going so far ?
oh that ' s like the reverse pregnancy . when the husband gains the weight !
wow ! that ' s so amazing . i bet you are so proud of him
i bet ! what a bright young man you raised !
oh no . have you made plans on what you ' re going to do to take care of them ?
it sounds like a tough situation . i feel for ya .
does she live far away from you ?
how often do you get to see her ?
how interesting . what country she is at now ?
i think england is a pretty safe country . that will be so much fun when you go there
oh man . i am sorry . your time will come . that is a very hard situation ! one of those hard ones in life .
maybe you should ask your boss ? maybe he is more char ##as ##matic . that happens sometimes . i am sorry . i ' ve been there !
that is so generous . sounds like she has found her calling in life .
i hope she is getting the donations she needs to keep doing this .
was he abusive ?
that ' s too bad . hopefully he gets better and wakes up now that she left .
that is des ##pic ##able . what did you do ?
i agree with that . that animal is probably very lucky because of you .
it has already taken its first steps towards independence , that is something big
is achieved at a steady pace . . . it fills us with hope and happiness
that ##s a bum ##mer . what do you do there ?
oh nice ! good for you . maybe go for a run ?
wow . what grip ##e does your aunt have with your mom ?
those kinds of people usually have the worse self - esteem .
woo ##ho ##o ! that is amazing . hope it came with some great benefits .
hey sometimes that ##s even better . more financial stability is great .
must have been really nos ##tal ##gic . did you think about going to play on that field again ?
childhood seems to be a great time for most , but then we wanted to grow up too fast .
i bet you feel great too .
that is awesome . cong ##rat ##s !
i ' m sorry to hear that . tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with .
going isn ' t fun , but unfortunately it ' s necessary some times . i hope you feel better soon .
you did the right thing . . . do you foster them or are they yours since kitten ##s ?
really kind of you !
what happened ?
oh my god . you shouldn ' t just get over it - it is not right . betrayal is something no one should do to another .
wow ! it ' s always nice when life works out well , especially if the person deserves it .
that is hard ! i am glad she sees her worth and is going to get more education .
that ' s some great police workforce your town has . ( sarcasm )
wow , what state is this in ?
that is awesome ! what are you going to do ?
that is very brave . i a sure you will do great !
what does ? were you in a car ride with your aunt ?
oh you ' re an 80s kids , hu ? what do you feel about the music nowadays ?
is it something that commits you a lot ?
ah ##h . . . then you have to support it
that really sucks
i always hate when work gets in the way of having friends . it ' s always one way or the other . if it ' s not your schedule it ' s theirs
cool . did he thank the " little people " ?
that ' s good . sometimes bosses think they do it all by themselves .
that is great . you must be so proud
that is really impressive considering summer is really tough to learn that !
great , are you taking anyone with you ?
that should be a very fun trip for you .
oh god . how big was it ?
man , that ' s scary . is it out now ?
what ? ! you should ask them for a free upgrade , because that ' s not cool .
that ' s awful . try asking for the manager next time .
getting away is definitely needed sometimes .
are you vacation ##ing somewhere nearby or somewhere else ?
that is disappointing . what kind of laptop is it ?
i know how that is . good luck with your search !
i know . sometimes it ' s hard to have some left over after bills . what are you saving for ?
ye ##a , it is a lot of expenses people don ' t prepare for so ##em ##time ##s .
why did you leave ?
it ' s rare to find a place where everyone gets along . i hope your new job is still nice ?
ye ##a , but i try not to compare . it ' ll just make me feel bad . what about you ?
wow . how does one get a new car every month . must be loaded .
that ' s great . true freedom !
i will get there one day .
is it a well paying one ?
stabilize things first , then save regularly .
that ' s awesome . you must feel really relieved .
do you tend to have a lot of work ?
woo ho ##o ! that ##s awesome . losing weight can be so hard !
that ##s the way to do it ! ke ##to has helped me a lot . yes a lifestyle change versus a diet .
wow , go mom ! is she always such a sweetheart ?
i hope you guys let her know how appreciated she is !
yi ##kes ! what did he do to deserve that kind of punishment ?
oh man ! you ' re right for punish ##ing him . theft is very bad !
that ' s great ! i ' ve been meaning to , but haven ' t had the time .
have you lost any weight over h ##t epa ##st month ?
wow ! i just found one dog and i thought that is rough . are you foster ##ing them now ?
wonderful ! rescues will help you with contracts and getting them fixed if you need help . fix those babies up : ) thanks for keeping them safe !
she sounds like a wonderful person . people who try to help defense ##less animals are really special .
she sounds wonderful . i ' d definitely want to be friends with someone like that .
that is hilarious ! was it embarrassing or funny at the time ?
i can understand that
that ' s great . sometimes co - workers can be hit or miss . when you get good ones , it ' s awesome .
is that something your work arrange ##s ?
how old is he ?
have you tried reward ##ing him when he does ?
it is great to have more time with the kids .
my first work from home was stress ##ful i had to send the kids to day ##care . not anymore !
uh ##oh . was it work appropriate ?
oh no . when will you have to talk to your boss ?
wow . i bet he is tired all the time . i drink coffee all day for energy
yeah , it ' s very important to finish school so you don ' t have to work three jobs just to survive .
oh no ! that ' s so sad .
i don ' t think they know where they ' re going . probably just trying to get home .
oh i used to love baby ##sit ##ting . . . depending on the child ha ##ha . how do you feel about it ?
i understand where you ' re coming from . i would probably feel the same way in your shoes .
oh ? what ' s your new gig ?
that does sound pretty good . i mean , working from home is great , but doing it on your own time is way better .
lo ##l . that ' s funny . better hope you don ##t end up on youtube .
you will be the talk of the break room .
being single isn ' t all that bad . are you looking for someone ?
better to be single than be with weird ##os .
how can you tell if a cactus is dead ?
i ' ve never seen that before
that ' s very kind . many people wouldn ' t go out of their way to do that .
we need more people like you . the world would be a better place .
that sounds like a good lunch ! i love ta ##co bell
that is definitely good , i am not that fortunate !
that ' s pretty nice of you . has she had any interviews ?
i know the feeling . it can be hard getting back out there .
why ? what do they do ?
people can be so lazy and inc ##ons ##ider ##ate of others .
that will be sad . are you going to get to go again before then ?
take lots of pictures , so you can remember it !
must ' ve been a really difficult exam . will there be other exams to balance it out ?
i guess the teacher wasn ' t going to listen to you ? that sucks .
that sounds great ! any particular cuisine in mind ?
oh i love those . they always have great selections and the dessert ##s aren ' t bad either .
i hope it goes well !
try to get some rest beforehand .
wo ##ah , did she say she was coming back ? she ' s awful ##ly trusting .
totally , and i bet most people would walk off with it . i have no faith in humanity .
are you the parent or the teacher ? i get nervous meeting anyone new
i felt like that when my kids were younger . doesn ' t feel like that now they ' re teenagers . it ' ll be ok just act natural
that was nice . id ##id they have to start it over ?
did she hurt herself ?
that ' s great to hear . what ' s going on ?
that sounds really great . happy for ya .
wow . that ' s a great accomplishment . i hope to buy a house soon .
i don ' t stretch myself too thin . i know i ' m far from rich .
oh no , that sucks . what happened at court ?
jesus . that ' s terrible . i hope you get a breathe ##r from that .
that was so nice of them to do such a thing .
i bet it is . when things like that happen it makes you really value where you work . makes it enjoyable .
do you guys not get together often anymore ?
you all can still spend time together separately even if you can ' t all be together . have to make it work .
that ' s great to hear ! if you don ' t mind me asking , what happened ?
still , that ' s still great . you better knock on some wood though , just in case . don ' t jin ##x it !
i know the feeling . at least you made it .
three hours though . i don ' t think i would ' ve made it .
oh no . what happened ?
if only people were more consider ##ate of others . it ' s not just them in the world .
are they grown up now ? they grow up so fast .
ha ##ha ##ha i bet there are .
cool . i ' ve never been camping .
i would be afraid of animals and bugs i think .
that happens sometimes . maybe next year .
i took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if that ' s where we are going .
well it ' s 9 hours away so we probably won ' t go until next year either lo ##l
did you get lucky and some kind person turn it in
that is horrible . just think it could have been worse . you could have wrecked and totaled a car or a house burnt . lots of things are worse .
glad for you . a girl i know was walking to her house and a car hit her and killed her . so it ' s just money and can be replaced
yes , we are here for just a short time
om ##g . i would have been so scared .
did it get away or bite you ?
with what ?
well , you ' re popular then at least .
that actually makes sense to me .
did you notice any funny glances from anyone ?
did you taste anything funny from the lipstick ?
that sounds great ! did you just get out of a rough relationship ?
oh go ##sh , i ' m sorry to hear that . hang in there , there ' s a lot of great guys out there .
probably , time to get the traps and get rid of it .
going to have to do something . . . call somebody to help you .
huh ?
that happens sometimes . is it like that this time of year ?
will it pick up soon ?
why have you been lazy ?
what kind of work is it ?
oh nice ! are you taking any cool classes ?
how exciting ! the first day of school is always so fun .
hope they don ' t find out . were you just tired or something else ?
well , next time try telling her the truth , like , i am too tired right now , can we do it another day . and that way you won ' t feel bad .
i ' m sure she would understand if she is a good friend .
i bet it will be a good dinner , since there is some guilt involved . lo ##l
that ' s true . i ' m glad i live in an apartment .
lo ##l . i think that ' s more hard work , but you ' d only have to do it once lo ##l
what ' s the model / make
dan ##g that is a pretty slick ride . . . how close are you to buying one
i really hate that !
some people are so petty .
does that still happen ? i can relate . . . it was a relief to go on vacation and get away from them .
that ' s great . i went to europe for a while and came back to the more of the same st ##omp ##ing around above my head . it was a dream to get away .
wow . that ' s exciting !
its not that bad . i ' ll get to europe one day lo ##l
i dread that it will go so quickly !
what do you do during the day ?
what were you standing on ? just the ground ?
are those by kanye west ? not hip with the ling ##o .
i have heard water is expensive in california . well , they are worth it if you can jump straight up five or six feet .
i might be able to do that , not sure .
o ##of that sucks . sorry about that . i don ##t like cutting my grass so my front door is covered in pink papers from city citations . o ##of
nothing like red ##neck engineering . did you use flex tape .
oh dar ##n i really like those info ##mer ##cial ##s , wanted to know how the stuff worked .
actually it costs 15 dollars where i ' m located .
you like it a lot , now what does it do ?
of mike tyson
i hate when that happens , and they tell you to come early too .
seems fair , they don ' t value your time it seems like .
it is always nice to be able to rely on friends when you need them most .
i hope the party turned out to be a great success because of his help .
how come ?
oh no , i couldn ' t imagine ! i ' m so sorry !
yeah and how easy life was ? i wish we could at ##lea ##st have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them !
id ##k ourselves maybe ? lo ##l : d
do you mind talking about it specifically ?
ha ##ha well that ' s a pleasant surprise . . . what kind of car
that is such a beautiful memory to have . i love that we forever have moments like this . . . how cool hong kong !
i do actually quite a few mainly old country songs like daddy ##s hands is a big one super old ##ie ! : )
do you have a past traumatic experience ?
sorry to hear that . i ' m positive you ' ll be smart about your lifestyle choices though
some things like that you won ##t ever forget that ##s pretty ra ##d
you should do it again just for the heck of it
sometimes i feel the same as you . . . but i get up and move on
that ' s right . . . i wish i could do that . . . disco ##nne ##ct
did you stu ##b your toe ?
oh no ! that ' s even worse ! did you pu ##ke a little ? i would ' ve thrown up !
what did he say ?
always good to trust your spouse , but i would be on the fence a bit and have my eye out too .
that is pretty bad situation he is in . i feel little mad myself too .
yeah i would say the same to him too man .
when did you start getting better
that ' s pretty cool
how old is he ? i really hope its nothing serious : /
wow that really is too young ! lets hope its nothing serious . he will get thru it regardless .
what is it ?
i can tell ! are you doing anything special for it ?
are you going to be okay
i am glad you are okay
that doesn ' t seem fair , i hope they changed their ways eventually .
that ' s unfortunate , i wonder if he ' s forgiven them ?
that ##s so sweet i bet she is how old is she ?
om ##g i can ##t wait to see what that feels like as a parent cong ##rat ##s !
oh no , please tell me what ' s going on ! can i help ?
that ' s the worst , i ' m sure it was an annoyance !
nice i can relate . how old were you when you moved out
that ' s cool . i was 17 when i first moved out . now i ' m 26 , fully self - employed and hang out with whoever i want to . but i had to have a lot of faith in myself
that is pretty great ! i like it when you can wake up and not care about stuff .
that is pretty awesome ! i wish i could do stuff like that .
did he get it for you for a specific reason or just because ?
that ' s so kind of him ! what a dad !
i am sure you will love it
i am sure you will , good luck
why do you feel bad about yourself ? i am sure whatever it is can ' t be that horrible .
even if you feel you voted for the wrong person , you shouldn ' t worry . you will be able to vote for a new person in a couple years !
good luck ! i have faith on you .
i am sure you are going to excel ##l
i love that as well ! nothing better than unexpected cash ! has this happened to you recently ?
awesome ! cong ##rat ##s to you on that unexpected wind ##fall !
i think you should get out and explore . i ' m in a similar situation - - moved to south texas with zero connections / family to jumps ##tar ##t my business . . . and i ' ve met some pretty amazing people
you definitely will trust me
that happen to me frequently . did your manager said anything because you are late ?
it can be annoying
i am sorry to hear that . how long has he been promising you the promotion ?
i can imaging . he sounds pretty spine ##less and shady .
why did they do tha
i am sorry that happened to you
family is very important .
the same for me , i try to keep them close .
why do you think that ?
what will be her major ?
do you ? you should trust her , that ' s what marriage is about !
that ' s awful , i ' m sorry .
i am really sorry . do you have house insurance ?
do you have a place to stay for a while ?
yes . . . but in what context
nice that ' s pretty smart . . . always go with your instincts
yeah . . . . but his daughter is doing pretty well at least almost ending up like him .
well she is still pretty young and learning to handle animals probably be like her father sooner or later . /
well , that ' t not your fault at all . it ' s your sc ##umb ##ag significant other ' s fault . you shouldn ' t feel ashamed for the cr ##um ##my thing he did - you did nothing wrong .
if he ' s not meeting your standard then it ' s time to find a new boyfriend - even if that ' s the hard thing to do . you shouldn ' t ever lower your standards .
oh my go ##sh no , are you feeling okay ?
are you taking medicine for that ? do you have heart ##burn or do you feel g ##lu ##tton ##ous ?
i would love that too
that won ##t be too hard
sorry to hear that . is he better now ?
did the doctors have found what was the issue with his heart ?
that ' s pretty cool . what flavor do you think you are going to get ?
berry sounds like it would be very ta ##sty .
whoa , did anything bad happen ?
i ' m glad nothing bad happen , snake venom can really mess you up . . .
how did you feel about that
i know the feeling . just broke up with my ex - g ##f 5 months ago . but he / she is out there , chin up : )
wow good luck , i ' m a big fan of watching mma myself .
oh o ##ops , my fault for assuming . definitely an intense experience either way as you said .
u ##gh , i did the same thing today ! i ' m going to have to start making fresh cups in the morning and afternoon .
can ' t go wrong with a spit ##to ##on . and it makes a nice conversation piece when you have visitors over .
that ' s awesome ! was it your birthday ?
your friends care a lot of you and that ' s always a great feeling ! i hope you had fun !
oh no , are you okay
i hate being that drunk
dan ##g , that ' s kinda hurt ##ful . why did you miss the wedding ?
i ' ve had those days before . i would just take it as a lesson and try to control your drinking next time when important events are in the near future .
how did it go ?
how long did it take to prepare for ?
aw , sorry about that ! did you have a pet you could take there with you ?
yeah , i have a dog and i take it to the park sometimes . it can help you feel less lonely for sure .
dan ##g , that ' s quite a large amount of money to lose . hopefully it went to someone who needs it .
that would be nice . maybe he ' ll go and buy some candy from the candy store .
i try not to have any friends .
i advice not to trust anyone ever . stay to yourself and be sad my friend .
i do not want to be the first one .
well that isn ' t really pleasant i bet .
well hope you didn ' t have flashbacks of it too often .
best of luck ! have you won in the past ?
wow you ' re pretty lucky . . . i can never win those things
are you a mother ? it could be a maternal thing / instinct .

nissan ' s are top of the line . i hope you get a lot of use out of it .
what is the trick
that is a good dog then
aw , that sucks . everyone gets old eventually , how old is she / he ?
that ' s good to hear , i hope he feels and gets better
i think those people don ' t actually eat that much , it just seems like it though .
if he ' s taller / bigger than you it would make sense if he doesn ' t gain any weight
that seems like a lot of pizza rolls , how do you feel ?
hey , we all pig out at some point
that ' s too bad . it ' s nice to have friends to rev ##el in our victories . why don ' t you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch ?
if you need someone to join in , just let me know !
i am sorry to hear that . any certain areas you think you could have done better on ?
don ' t be so hard on yourself . most people can ' t even spell physics .
oh no what happened
i am sorry , i hope you find it
that ' s so sad to hear ! how did she pass ? if you don ' t mind me asking .
that ' s terrible , my friend . how are you holding up ?
i love it when it rains .
sunny days are very hot and i do not like that .
nice , i usually forget a thing or two . did you get everything you needed ?
i assume you were very prepared !
what techniques have you learned so far though ?
i think you will do pretty well then in a street fight .
go on
that ' s pretty cool . grew up with the game ##boy color and game ##boy advance myself

your neighbor is a good person . i would have . . . given it back to you ha ##ha .
i have a pe ##sky , sneak ##y little dog like that too ! did you clean it up ?
that ' s good . was she guilty when she saw you cleaning it up ?
that is disgusting , my dog does that too but in sneak ##y places . it ' s always a surprise lo ##l
yeah , our dogs need to be punished and maybe trained more .
oh wow . maybe they were busy doing other things ? did you find anyone else to play with ?
sometimes playing by ourselves is how we get better .
what kind of job
i am sorry that happened

i love that too ! isn ' t it great !
what are you planning on doing with your vacation time ?
what happened that day ?
did any of you get hurt ?
wow , that ' s unfortunate . people don ' t realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little .
sorry to hear that , recovering from any pet lose is hard .
did you get attacked by a big dog when you were little ?
maybe it was because you saw your brother get attacked by one and you are scared it might happen to you .
did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back ?
i understand .
sorry to hear that . how did she pass ?
man , very sorry to hear that . first your mom , now your aunt . sounds like you have very unfortunate relatives .

dentist aren ' t people focused on trying to hurt you .
ut oh . . what did you eat ?

mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things .
that ##s good to hear . why do you thank god for her ?
well that ##s nice . i thank god for my wife as well
well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me .
that is also very important to learn .
that sucks , do you feel better now ?
yeah , isolation can happen when you get super sad . at least you are feeling better now
that ' s always a positive in my book , what kind of food was it ? what were your reservations about the restaurant before going ?
is it in a bad part of town or is the building just bad luck or run down ?
i am sorry , that sounds bad
maybe it won ##t happen again
oh my go ##sh ! that must have been so embarrassing !
don ' t worry . i ' m sure you will never make that mistake again !
aw , that sucks because money was the issue . maybe she can take a bus or something ?
ya ##y ! i love happy endings
oh how scary ! what happened ?
i am so sorry you had to see that . that is so bad . did you have to call it in ?
ou ##ch ! that stink ##s man why she do it ?
that is even worse , like why would someone just do that when commit ##ed to someone .
parties are some times very loud .
if my friends did that i would have a heart attack .
what movie are you referring too ?
oh ! well i haven ' t seen that yet . was the action at least somewhat decent ?
yeah i hate waiting for the results of a long term goal
damn , you suck at soccer . just kidding , good job ! ! lo ##l

what did you lie to him about ?
i am sorry , he will stop eventually

i ' m sorry , i ' ve dealt with something like that before and it can be very anger inducing .
did you do anything wrong ?
oh . . that ##s horrible . i am so sorry .
myself as well , friends are what make life better .
alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone .
was it a smartphone ? maybe you can track it ?
aw , that sucks . did you get a new phone ?
he is a terrible person ! did he even know it was your cat ? what took so long . . .
i hope you feel better
what kind of cars do you like the best ?
range rovers are my favorite too . if you work hard you can get one !
when did she pass away ?
well have you been living a happy life ? she would probably be happy about that .
i am sure she is happy too
it can be hard , but its possible
do you have cameras ?
i know right ? it ' s even more worse when it ' s hot outside and it cooks to your car so it ' s harder to clean up
have you seen any recently ? it is really sad , what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit .
poor thing , it ' s not fair ! drivers need to watch out !
well hopefully the car didn ' t get damaged .
well i would just be happy nothing too bad happened at least .
that ' s frightening . was it dark outs ##side ?
that ' s even worse . i hate being lost in general
oh man that stink ##s . what did you do in response ?
did he ever apologize ?
i ' ve never had a party like that myself .
no one really likes me enough to do that for me .
what journey ? do tell .
oh congratulations . . . that is a huge accomplishment !
o ##of , that is a long healing process after the surgery .
that is tough i bet . i hope he heal ##s well .
that ' s awesome ! did you guys do anything ?
nice ! i hope you guys did a lot of catching up !
wow ! what a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him . was it a lot of money ?
i ' m so sorry , you should see if you can find him on social media !
who was following you ? !
what did he look like ? i would call the cops if they are stalking you .
oh man ! does it still work ? ?
i would have sat there playing for hours .
oh snap ! dude get your camera you might have found ness ##y .
probably could be a new species of ga ##tor .
i know how that goes . it can be hard to stay on track at the end of the semester .
congratulations ! studying really pays off !
je ##ez ##e , i thought that only happened to me . doesn ' t it just suck ? i don ' t blame you for not picking it up , i can imagine how gross it must ' ve been
it ' s okay , most people would do that and not even care , so the fact that you even have the trash ##man in your mind shows that you ' re a good person .
yeah , been there done that . you want to comfort them but you don ' t know what to do / say
i hope he feels better and you could be there for him too !
oh poor lady . i know how it is though . sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate .
at least you recognize that it may not have been appropriate .
i can imagine . was she a ho ##ard ##er of some type ?
did you see anything interesting ?
did you tip him well for doing such a good job ?
it is not often that you get good service at a restaurant .
i enjoy doing that after a hard day at work as well . i hope it relax ##es you !
now i am in the mood for netflix ! enjoy the new series now that you are relaxed !
did you punch him in the nose ?
this is why i got rid of all of my friends .
ah - that ' s a big accomplishment ! ! ! did you get her a great present ?
ha ##ha ! that is the best tradition i ' ve ever heard of !
oh man , i know the nerves can be rough , but i ' m sure you ' re excited as well . but ye ##a , throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough .
oh wow . well , i really hope you enjoy the new job ! i have a feeling you ' ll do just fine .
yes . . i have a test coming up and i should be studying right now ! lo ##l
they say some of the smart ##est people are pro ##cr ##ast ##inator ##s .
did you find anything interesting inside any of the buildings ?
oh man , i would have freaked out ! what did you do ?
that is pretty great ! what show is it ?
haven ' t heard of it but since your son ' s going to be on it i will watch it .
as someone who was once a 19 year old man , don ' t be too shocked .
yi ##kes he ' s one of the zombie drunk ##s . that ' s unfortunate . drinking might not be for him .
most do . i know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that . his brother does too . now neither of them drink hard liquor ( well they haven ' t for ages now )
that ' s really cool . i know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him .
that ' s really interesting . i know my husband is bad about leaving his laying around and forgetting where they are . when he finds them again it is such a surprise .
what was it ?
so everything is okay then ? that ' s good news !
oh no i ' m so sorry to hear that . are you thinking about getting another one ?
oh i understand . they say time heal ##s all wounds , i hope it does in your case as well .
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i have been to court before ; it isn ' t as scary as it seems .
that won ' t happen . even if it does , the judge may have a good laugh and cut you some slack .
i am guessing she is not with us anymore ?
i know the feeling i had my grandmother gone for 5 years now still miss her .
did he tell you the reason ?
if you live under his roof then you should obey him .
i understand , i have trouble waking up early too .
me too , i just have to set a bunch of alarms and try my best .
were you worried it could be something very serious ?
that ' s good to hear . i ' m sure you feel very relieved now .
what was that ?
a bunch of toys and stuff ?
that is pretty good news ! what kind of job is it for ?
everyone needs a it guy though so probably .
i see people walk out of the bathroom all the time without washing their hands . so gross .
that is really disgusting . i don ' t think i would ever eat at his house .
yeah , no doubt !
i ' m sure you aren ' t the worst in the class , don ' t say that !
there ' s always next time , you just need to study harder !
that is awful . i hope she has friends and family she can lean on during this tough time .
i wouldn ' t wish that on my worst enemy . i feel so bad for her .
that ' s un ##lu ##cky , did you ever exchange information ?
well i hope it all works out in the end somehow .
what kind of dog was the costume or did it look weird ?
well were they trying to sell something maybe ?
that is so cool . what kinda stuff does she jug ##gle ?
ha ##ha ##ha funny .
oh , lord . did the other person die ?
man , i would have left and walked out right away .
that has to make you feel so good deep inside .
wow , that is thoughtful . thoughtful ##ness will help him go a long way in life .
wow ! how can someone do that to someone with someone so close ?
that ' s such a shame . and shame on his brother , too !
what did you watch / ?
so what was it ? you are making me scared .
oh man that is pretty scary .
you should probably see a priest then .
i hate when that happens . makes you want to leave things for the mail ##man .
i hope they can take it back for you .
are you baby crazy ? let me guess . . 30 - is ##h ?
that sucks . missed opportunity or biological problems ?
whatever it is , you seem excited . what is it ?
vacation ##s are soo ##oo ##o nice ! ! ! i hope you have an amazing one @ !
that ' s really annoying for you but i hope everyone involved is okay .
i cannot stand people who do that ! don ' t they know they could be blocking someone from getting the medical attention they need ?
why are you there all alone ?
i hope you aren ' t too lonely !
oh no . why did he steal ?
sometimes they have a reason , and it doesn ' t make him a bad person depending on the reason .
that was so nice of her . i ' m sure that you really appreciated her for doing that .
maybe you have a bud ##ding chef on your hands .
a bit of nostalgia , huh ? it is always wonderful to look back on old family memories .
the times we share with family should always be cher ##ished .
oh no , what happened if you don ' t mind me asking .
oh man , that sucks . you can enjoy the day on your own ! forget them then .
oh , i love surprises like that ! how exciting !
i hope not either but it ' s sweet !
you must be thrilled . what did you have ?
is this your first ?
oh no , i know that must make you feel bad , but you can ' t always be there .
that ' s good . how many girls do you have ?
that sucks . maybe they can wait just a bit longer for you ?
we always need to make time for our families . they are the most important thing in this world .
wow . must be a really good show . what ' s it about ?
i love thriller ##s . i watched killing eve .
are you working while you are at work ?
smart man smart man .
oh no , what happened to cause the cheating ?
have you guys talked about it ? or is he still upset ?
how many do you have ? are they excited ?
what is making you so nervous ?
had they been eating too many ?
oh , that ' s a cute one .
what will you do if you can ' t be with your wife all the time ?
oh that makes a lot of sense now then .
oh ##hh no ! there was no one there to offer you a towel ?
was it crowded ?
how many kids would that be now ?
ha ##ha ##ha i bet they do !
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
are there any social groups you can join to have some company ?
is he bad at his job or hitting on you ?
make him facebook famous . the viral terrible mail man .
send you self a empty package or something .
wow . ra ##cco ##on digging through the trash , hu ?
are you usually afraid of ra ##cco ##ons or just surprised ?
was this an un ##pl ##anne ##d trip ?
well , i ' m sorry that this was sprung upon you , but i hope you have a safe trip !
wow . that ' s a pretty low thing to do .
oh just a nail ? you are a nice person .
wow ! what a champ for doing that . you guys owe him !
get that man a wife !
you must be so relieved that its done .
they are going to have so much fun with it .
that ' s a really adult move on her part .
she ' s showing she ' s responsible . i think she ' ll be just fine growing up .
i wish you the best of luck on your proposal and the possibility of it becoming a reality .
what kind of project may i ask ?
i hope you did well and congratulations on law school !
law is a pretty tough career . you must ' ve worked hard , and i ' m sure that will pay off .
sometimes it is very hard and the jealousy can come out . i hope you have a really strong relationship though .
i have seen many relationships be destroyed because of time and space . good luck to you all .
that ' s so great to hear . relationships can be hit or miss sometimes . sounds like you got a good one .
over 2 decades . that ' s a long time .
that sounds cool . so you are fixing it yourself ?
best of luck with that . hopefully you will do fine and save a ton of cash .
oh no , do you at least have food ?
ram ##en is delicious ! i eat them even when i ' m not worrying about money .

whoa ! make sure to bring money for food or bring frozen drinks . and lots of suns ##creen and com ##fy shoes !
i ' m glad you can do what you ' re passionate about . what kinds of animals do you rescue ?
that sounds so fun . i hope i can do that some day , too !
i can imagine . take this time to do something for yourself .
there you go . sounds like fun .
caught by a train ? do you mean it was late ?
ha ##ha ##h i was kind of concerned but didn ' t want to ask . glad that is the case then .
what did he do ?

i ' m sorry . that is a really tough situation . i ' ll be thinking of you and hoping for the best .
i ' m sure you ' ll be able to do yours soon . and maybe you can get some good ideas from hers !
and when you do yours it will be that much newer than hers ; )
i bet you are very eager to find out , good luck !
was the test hard ?
double check your list . camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot .

me either . i don ' t want too though , lo ##l . are you scared ?
oh man . well i used to cu ##ddle a dog when i would get scared . find a dog
oh nice . what color is it ?
interesting to see how mu ##ave works . that ' s a shade of purple , isn ' t it ?
oh no . i hope they ' re okay . how long until your neighbor gets home ?
i hope everything turns out okay .
man , that ' s horrible luck . did you forget to lock it , or did they just bust in ?
are you kidding me ? the nerve of some people . how desperate do you have to be . . . well , i hope you can at least replace the present so your son isn ' t too sad . and at least they didn ' t try to bust into your home and harm you .
that ' s pretty lucky , did you spend it ?
well if you do choose to spend it make sure you do it wise ##ly !
lo ##l ! the real question is . . . was the po ##op fresh or old ? i hate that shit , no pun intended
e ##w ##w ##w , did you clean it off ?
i wish i had a expedition
why do you think that ?

you better come up with something .
oh man ! will you need a new keyboard now ?
oh don ' t worry , accidents happen !
yes ! ! ! i hate the city and prefer the rural areas . are you going to get farm animals ?
i agree , i love farms because it feels so natural .
at this point all you can do is hope for the best . hopefully if you worked hard it will turn out good .
don ' t stress over it . you can ' t change anything at this point .

you ' re moving into the dorm ##s soon , hu ? are you excited ?
what ' s your major ?
that is cool ! was it a gift for any certain occasion ?
i bet you were so happy ! that ' s so awesome !
i am sure it will be worth it in the end
i bet he was proud too
animal abuse disgust ##s me . i don ' t what would drive someone to do that . . .
if i had a chance to rescue an animal , i would totally do it .
did you get suns ##creen and a water ##proof belly bag and a hat ?
oh no ! yes it ' s the number one thing to not forget . i hope you all have fun !
wow , how exciting . i bet it looks like a fat little old man .
i would hit it out of spit now
must have thought you wanted some of his sweet unemployment check
that ' s what i ' m talking about ! that sounds so nice . i ' m a little jealous . sounds like you deserve it , though .
that ' s always nice to hear . better that then hearing someone else getting the spotlight and recognition just because they ' re in a higher position . i hope that keeps happening for you .
he sounds so computer - sa ##vy . how will you repay him ?
dinner might be a welcomed surprise .
me too ! ! i love summer weather and vibe ##s so much
i know , the free time is the best . you can do whatever you want , whenever !
oh no . shame of you !

i am sure you will get it
i do believe you
whoa whoa whoa , that still happens in this day and age ? how did they even get away with that ?
well , good . i hope they got a lot of negative press . that stuff shouldn ' t fly these days .
that is way too much money to blow for sure
i feel bad for the parents then
that is horrible ! were their any cameras ?
oh man . that ' s too bad . still not fair .
sounds like so much fun . what did you see ?
it must have been really scary movie then . try leaving the tv on to help .
that sad . i hope she is okay .
it will be fine . make sure you spend time with her and let her know that it will be okay . it can be helpful /
that sounds delicious ! what type of pizza did you order ?
lo ##l ! maybe the rat is the chef ? the restaurant ' s secret is a rat in the hat !
aw ##w , that ' s sad . do you have a bad relationship or not have one ?
that can get really lonely but it ' s good to find yourself so you are really ready when the right one comes along .
i feel you , my brother is my roommate and my friend too : )
that sucks , why did she move out ?
i know exactly what you mean . i ' ve been single 2 years now .
i think i ' m a little rusty in that department myself .
why aren ' t you looking forward to it ?
that ' s unfortunate . a week is a long time .
that sounds like a lot of fun ! i mean i haven ' t even really gone anywhere higher than olive garden myself , so i ' m jealous . did you go with anyone special ?
that ' s really sweet ! i bet that was a nice scene . was it a special occasion , or did you guys just want to enjoy yourselves just for the heck of it
than ##t sucks . i always use turbo tax .
maybe ##the ##y will let you do a payment plan ?
well i bet you ' ll do better next time . i hate paying extra for anything .
oh wow ! that ' s awesome ! what will you buy ?
that ' s a good idea . it ' s extra money so do what you want !
that ' s awesome ! how long has it been since you ' ve seen him ?
oh , that sucks then . i hope you guys get along and squash beef ?
i am sorry , that sounds gross
i hate that smell
nice ! thinking about it . . . i ' m 22 and still don ' t know how to change a tire ha ##ha ##h
i should learn how to do it , it seems pretty basic ?
nice , tell him cong ##rat ##s . what did he major in ?
he should become an english teacher ##1
how much did you lose
i am sure you will make it
why ?
why would he do that ? ?
what is her name ?
that ; s cute . i love the cute names people give their pets .
don ' t feel guilty . we all slip sometimes .
ha ha . just try to do better next time .
what was the menu ?
i bet she loved it !
what ' s wrong ?
i hope so too . i ' m sorry that he is going through that .
a lot of kids these days are addicted to technology . does she listen to you often ?
that sucks . how old is she because if she is young she may grow out of it
that ' s great . sometimes family isn ' t good with loans .
was it pretty far down before ?
wow , they are still making them ? only ones i enjoyed was mw ##1 , mw ##2 , and bo ##1 .
i actually did buy that one on steam but it barely has any players : (
what is your favorite dish ?
i ' ve heard of that dish before . i need to try it sometime , can i come ? !
i bet you find someone soon
i have been there too , it will get better
sounds like she ' s going to be on " master chef " in a couple of years . what did she make ?
that ' s wise - it ' s ir ##res ##pon ##sible to let kids mean ##der in the kitchen alone . too many sharp objects .
that ##s sounds promising .
sometimes people think they don ' t need to study , but it really is helpful even if you think you know the material
aw ##w , that ' s sweet of her ! you ' re lucky to have her , not all mom ##s are good .
that ' s good , i ' m sure she enjoys seeing you happy and taken care of .
that ' s pretty sweet of her . some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them , but i say you shouldn ' t take it for granted . they just want to be in your life .
well , let her know here and there how much you appreciate it . sometimes we forget that even though we think and feel certain things , it ' s not always obvious to the other person . they need some verbal confirmation of appreciation !
eating vegetables is disgusting to me so i just blend it all in a smooth ##ie . you should try that
honestly , i have no idea . but it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever
i hate that feeling . hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow .
you can always start again tomorrow .
well at least after the storm , there will be some sunshine !
that ' s where ear ##mu ##ffs or plug ##s come in handy my friend
that is horrible luck ! at least you weren ' t hurt . some insurance companies cover that as well , so you should check .
hopefully that little mis ##ha ##p doesn ' t cot you an ##uth ##ing !
o ##oo ##o , that sounds fun . will you visit that giant place where glad ##ia ##tors fought ?
well , now i know where i want to visit too . great idea !
hey , i just saw that trailer ! i ' m kind of excited for it too since i loved him as a kid . but i felt like the trailer had a few dumb lines it , even though i love tom hardy .
you ' re right , he was pretty good as bane . glad to see someone else is a fan and is looking forward to it . i see it getting a lot of ne ##gat ##ivity .
i agree , i love that feeling . what do you do for work ?
nice , i bet it sucks when it ' s blazing hot outside .
who did you invite ?
where was the party ?
october ? i thought most call of duty games come out in november ?
it will be october as soon as you know it , trust me . hopefully they release a beta so we can play it earlier .
i have not seen it yet , tell me ab ##no ##ut it
that sounds insane honestly .
wow . really ? what kind ?
what ' s your uncle ' s number ? lo ##l
cool . say hi to your new aunt ##ie !
happens a lot to me actually , it ' s sometimes enough to make me sad .
yeah , i get like that . i sometimes drive somewhere just to get the feeling i used to have there . crazy how life goes .
i ' m sorry you were di ##ssa ##pp ##oint ##ed . it is hard to spend so much money on a du ##d movie . was the popcorn good at least ?
it ' s always good to save money , but still , it stink ##s . they should have to make them good for the prices they charge .
wow , she is a keeper . what car is it ?
congratulations on the strong marriage and car !
i know you will be great in the end .
people do that sometimes , and it is really sad .
why ? what happens on christmas eve for you ?
oh ##hh , du ##h ! i should have seen that coming lo ##l
that ' s too bad . are you thinking about going to court for it ?
yeah , that ' s a load of w ##ha ##ck . i hope you win your case and show those pigs who ' s boss .
well that ' s disappointing . have you been working there longer then your co - worker ?
i believe in you ! !
my friends and family always talk about that show , is it good ?
i heard it ' s really graphic and a lot of sex scenes . i will watch it . . . for educational purposes .
iv ##e been there
just imagine if you found a mix tape on an actual cassette
are you sure it wasn ' t pal ##ying dead ?
e ##w ##w , what the heck ! i guess you really were at a bad place at the time .
i ' m sure you will knock it out of the park . what is it on ?
that ' s neat - i like economics as well . why are you so gun ##g - ho about it ?
why ?
oh , then don ' t feel bad ? i think the teacher is trying to get everyone else involved .
you can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet . just keep your head up - things will get better .
if i ever meet you , i will toss a few bucks your way . we all have to help each other out in this tough world .
cool ! what did you get ?
well good for you !
investigate that right now ! you need to know
i would not do that , just get a divorce and take half of all .
wow . i hope you have studied hard so you will do well .
well as long as you have studied hard you should do well . just relax knowing you have prepared yourself .
oh my goodness ! did you get hurt ?
that ' s so sad . did your house get damaged ?
yeah , that bother ##s me to . don ' t sweat it too much though . just consider it their loss and move on .
there are . the people who ignore you are not worth your time or effort .
you got this bro , just be confident . i believe in you
she likes you ! if she asks / talks about you then you have a much better chance too .
that is so great ! are you in the process of applying now ? i ' m sure you will get in eventually .
perhaps . or you just need to keep trying . don ' t give up on your dreams so easily !
that sounds interesting , is it hard to make ?
did you really just say that ha ##ha ##ha . you are crazy
that sounds like fun . but i don ' t think hill ##bill ##y is a very nice way to describe people .
funny , but true . have you ever been to the races before ?
exciting ! did you get any neat gifts ?
it ' s always good to have friends that know your likes . what is in your collection ?
that ' s always fun . did you win any money ?
oh dar ##n . better luck next time .
that is terrible , are you okay ?
i feel super bad about that , i wish the best for you .
i believe in you , man . i ' m a bit rot ##und myself , but i started hitting the gym this past week .
yeah ! by the end of the year , we ' ll be lifting ford f 150 ' s !
for what ? are you a diver or something ?
oh , well good luck . have you heard of wi ##m ho ##f ? he ' s like a world record breath holder and he does it in freezing temperatures too .
my dog does that too . i think it ' s the loud noises that scare them .
lo ##l , if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying . that would be hilarious .
ha ##ha . these dogs that i ' m dog - sitting wouldn ' t let that happen . they wake me up at 6 : 30 ##am every morning to feed them . but hey , we make mistakes . maybe you had a busy day today .
ah , hate ' s a strong word . they ' re smarter than we give them credit for . they know you always feed them . at the end of the day , i doubt she could have a much better owner
what is a aa ##rd ##var ##k ?
i thought so . the name alone sounds so exotic , were you mad that you had to clean po ##oop ?
you usually don ' t get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident . it shouldn ' t be so bad , but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future .
oh wow . i really hope that you get the help you need . i can relate though . . . i used to be reckless like that a couple years back . just have to be responsible and arrange an uber or some other form of transportation .
oh , i am so sorry to hear that . did you get her something nice ?
that was very thoughtful , something to keep her entertained when she wasn ' t feeling well . is she doing better ?
that ' s gross .
thanks for that information .
that ' s so nice ! did she like your craftsman ##ship ?
it was still a nice gesture . i would love my children to build be a big ole gaze ##bo .
nice ! did you manage to s ##na ##g the promotion ?
it ' s good to work hard for that dough . what ' s your new bill ##et en ##tail ?
oh my goodness ! i bet that was embarrassing . but it happens .
eventually they will forget . they will probably do something even more embarrassing then the joke will be on them . ha ##ha .
that is nice . what kind of computer did he get ?
i wish i had a better computer . why do they have to cost so much ?
how did that experience go ?
i ' m very glad , and i understand how the memories are .
i would too . what had happened ?
yes . did they admit fault ?
how old are your kids ?
are you worried they are going to be abducted or something ?
what can you lose ?
you do . i mean it can only go one of two ways . and if it goes one way , you can try again with another girl .
do they have ins ##om ##nia ?
well they will have ins ##om ##nia and sore bottoms ha ##ha
that happened to me too when i was in elementary school . i lost all my friends and had to make new ones , which sucks .
i agree .
i bet she felt really special !
i can relate to that !
me too . i miss payments sometimes because i forget about them and i ' m lazy .
that ' s my exact situation too .
ah , so you ' re in the same boat as me ? i can understand how that goes . electricity is so necessary nowadays , too .
i ' m with you . sometimes responsibilities get too overwhelming and you feel like you have to hide from them . at some point though , i ' m sure you and i will improve .
smoking is pretty bad for everyone .
you have to try , it could change your life .
i like dogs
how many do you have ?
can you get another job ?
can you take out a loan ?
yankees fan , huh ? i should pit you against my brother . he loves the red sox . i bet you guys would argue for a while .
ha ##ha , he ' d probably say the same thing to you . he ' s been a fan of them for about 20 years . what about you ? how long have you followed them ?
that sucks , how old were they ?
wow , how old are the kids ?
it ; s sad but i think so too .
congratulations . we don ' t share the same sentiment .
have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation ?
life is a scary place , anything could happen at any time .
really ? that ' s one of the sad ##des ##t things i ' ve heard in a while . i ' m sorry to hear that . what happened to your family , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
i am terribly sorry to hear that . you ' ve got to be really res ##ili ##ent to deal with that . maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others ?
did you do anything after she did it ?
i have never had siblings , so not sure what to tell ya .
why ' s that ? did you specifically have a bad experience with them , or just assume they ' re terrible no matter what ?
trapped in a cave ? i couldn ' t handle that . i ' m claus ##tro ##phobic . i ' d freak out in a second . how long were you trapped for ?
some people are just cruel .
you should have called the police . if they were just van ##dal ##s they probably did it to someone else to .
that ' s annoying . kids these days are really attached to electronics , just how it goes . i know it ' s hard to cut them off , but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely ?
i would be , too . at that age , they don ' t understand why they can ' t have it . it ' s like talking to a brick wall . i hope it gets easier for you as he gets older .
did you practice first in a parking lot ?
did you use gps ?
i can understand that . i feel like trump should have gone to jail a long time ago
i totally agree with you
i think they are just empty threats but you never know .
you and me both .
why don ' t you move back ?
can you make new friends where you are now ?
oh no ! how many days left until she starts school ?
wow , that ' s some really slow shipping times . maybe you will get lucky and they will come in the mail sooner .
i am totally with you
i am sure you could
how old is he ?
wow , you can teach an old dog new tricks .
indeed . it would be fun to see your friends again and be around them
i think being with children is a joy that not everybody can understand
how much is the phone ?
will you be able to pay that off quick thou ?
oh no . did it ever come back ?
that sucks . my sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didn ' t come back either . his name was ore ##o . i told my daughter he got married .
where did you go ?
i love new orleans .
aw ##w ##w ##w i can relate to that . i am so sorry .
i am very sorry to hear that
who was it ?
that was nice of them .
i ' m not too fond of winter , but what kind of coat did you buy ?
awesome , i bet it ' s com ##fy ! how cold does it get where you live ?
when does he start ?
i am sure he will have fun .
you may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
neighbors , co - workers . try and get involved in local sports or com ##uni ##ty groups . how about volunteer ##ing . that is a good way to meet people that are positive
where did they come from ?
where did they go ?
i ' m not particularly a fan of subway ##s either , but why are you so scared of being robbed ?
i think the overall chances of that are pretty low . though i do understand your fear .
so i take it you get along well with your boss ?
that ' s great to hear , often times we here of people who hate their bosses !
that really is disappointing . can you fix it ?
i am so sorry to hear that
did you hurt yourself ?
i am sure they have fallen before , no big deal .
i ' m sorry to hear that . why do you think that is ? is it a painful or happy memory ?
i can understand that . that does sound like a difficult thing to deal with . hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by .
it is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be dil ##igen ##t for survival
indeed . nature is very interesting and complex to interpret . survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
i bet that was a nice surprise ! that ' s pretty cool . what was it for , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
that ' s really cool . . . and also way above my head ! but seriously , that sounds like smart , hard work . you should be proud . i ' m glad you got that " moment in the sun . "
wow , that ' s amazing ! shows that we can ' t judge a book by it ' s cover . we automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that !
i would have been unable to move for the rest of the day !
dan ##g , that ' s rough . like a double - dose of sadness . my girlfriend and i are long distance , so i know how that goes . is there any way you can still keep in touch with them ?
yeah , she and i don ' t use social media , but i can imagine that ' d be really helpful in your case . well , i ' m glad you at least have that . and maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people , too .
well , we don ' t like unnecessary attention , and we don ' t like talking about ourselves . we just like sky ##ping between each other , and that ' s it . and talking on the phone , of course .
was it for school ?
did you get fired due to it ?
that is a little da ##unt ##ing . have you considered joining some groups with like - minded individuals ?
check with your community center
aw ##w ! how sweet ! i can imagine the first few days are crazy .
i do not have any kids . honestly too scared for child birth ha ##ha
aw , that is fantastic ! how did ya ##ll meet ?
wow , you guys meet pretty early on . that ' s nice that you pretty much grew together as you became adults .
hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon !
happy early birthday then . drink up !
oh really ! any ideas why ?
maybe they like you ?
yes , they can be fun i guess .
yes that could be very annoying .
that is so sad . did the kitten die ? i hope not .
oh , i hope it was ok . i understand you not being able to stop .
no joke ? that ' s terrible . why was the security camera off ? and seriously , who steals a lawn mo ##wer ? what bum ##s .
oh , that makes sense . i had no idea , since i ' ve never used them . that sounds really inc ##on ##ven ##ient . maybe they were waiting for the perfect moment to strike . . . what chu ##mps .
oh wow , what luck ! i bet you slowed down after that !
well that ' s good that you use this as a reason to stop speeding . some people never learn !
i love colorado .
did you have fun ?
it is . now we have to deal with rains and snow ##s . so much to go for the next summer
i think climate change will only ex ##ace ##rba ##te the freezing temperatures during winter season
why did you decide not to go ?
did you make it to the game at least ?
what is the big end goal ?
i think you can do it .
that ' s not good . what ' s wrong ?
oh man , that would make me angry ! is there anyone you can call and report them anonymous ##ly ?
maybe you can sneak over and steal them ?
oh no that would make me feel guilty ! ! ! is he okay ?
is he allergic to that type of food ? if not you need to transition him slowly ! but that ' s funny lo ##l
who did you leave him with ?
did he destroy the house ?
that sounds great . what do you get to visit for ?
that sounds like a great experience !
i was too ! what do you think caused it ? !
i agree with you . having a good coach is crucial for team success .
what state is that ?
that does surprise me actually .
i ' m sorry to hear that . it always sucks missing the good old days .
i can kind of see where you ' re coming from . i personally try to avoid too much nostalgia . others seem to love it .
that is incredible . what a determination and dedication he must have put for achieving such a result
i wish i had that level of will ##power to even lose a couple of pounds from my hanging waist fat
wow , i have never been ! what all did you see ?
oh cool . what was you favorite thing at the square ?
a part in what ?
what play is it ?
that is rough news . how long ?
that is hard . i am so sorry
what kind of pup ##pies ?
why don ' t you buy one from your friend ?
oddly enough so am i . i just want to be comfortable . how do you feel about that ?
that ' s very good , do you feel content at the moment ?
did you spill something on it ?
did you hurt yourself ?
are you excited about it ?
i hope you have a great time !
maybe you should take a different class .
you will have to study harder then .
especially getting gifts from family . what a special holiday this is
how weird it may seem , but my mom still gives me children ' s book as a gift for each christmas
aw ##w ##w that is sad but happy al at the same time !
i hear that . you hang in there
does that usually happen often ?
ha ##ha yeah it happens to me too . i bet you ' re frustrated about that . have you tried different apps ?
i know what you mean . it is always a reason to be proud .
i just set short term goals along the way .
what does he do for work ?
well you could always pick up a new hobby ! what is something you ' ve always wanted to learn ?
me too
oh , man . why is that ?
that is wonderful to hear
don ' t ever forget why !
what time is it at ?
make sure you get there early .
why is that ?
have you spoke to her ?
oh yeah me too man , you like the fall ?
yeah me too it ' s very comfortable . what else do you think about it ?
why do you think that is ?
i love my dog , i still cheat on it .
how much did you win ?
do you have any of it left ?
yes , i prefer the fall also .
that football starts .
i ' m sorry about your loss . how are you doing ?
what exactly happened ?
that ' s great ! what makes you so confident ?
well that awesome to hear ! i hope you do get it soon !
gold club where ?
how many holes does it have ?
oh no ! what does he do that is so annoying ?
it is nice that he wants to stay connected i guess
who are you going with ?
nice , have they been before ?
you were ? was your pregnancy planned
ha ##ha ##h oh man finally that is so good ! congratulations on your children
oh no ! have you bought a test yet ? were you trying ?
that ##s scary ! i hope that you aren ' t pregnant then ! !
i hope so
what is the disagreement about ?
i agree . what do you think will help people get along ?
yes when i was little .
i also had a dog , did you find your dog ?
that is terrible , i would cry as well .
you can always adopt , that ##s what we did !
what kind ?
nice , was model is it ?
oh , wow ! that ' s awesome that your friend unexpectedly surprised you .
i bet that was really heart ##war ##ming . i ' m glad you had that experience .
tell me about it . i got like 3 hours last night
hey ! girlfriends just need an ear some time .
you can do whatever you want ! ! you like beer ?
oh okay i see lo ##l chu ##gging reminds me of high school
what do you do with her ?
is she still alive ?
yes you will with that attitude
that is the key isn ##t it ?
congratulations ! you and your family must be delighted to have a new member !
i am sure that you will be a great parent . you clearly show that you already love your new born daughter .
i would cry , very much !
i would cry and cry for days .
worms ? yu ##ck !
but you just said you do like them .
what are you going to buy ?
what store will you go to ?
i had to use a subway once to get to work on time .
it was ok , but while on the train i lost my phone and somebody returned it to me .
do you enjoy your free time or are you sad ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
cool , i have a pair of jeans .
when will you wear them ?
did you get sleepy while studying ?
i would have fallen asleep for sure .
i live and take care of my grandmother too !
ye ##a , i feel that it is worth every second of it ! they are the reasons we exist
that is understand ##able . you need to let it happen naturally . be with your friends and find yourself
i understand . it will happen for you if you keep an open mind and don ' t rush
did you not want to leave them with someone else ?
it is did you have fun ?
vegas is always a popular destination for vacation !
clubs are so fun ! any specific ones in mind ?
that ' s terrible ! how did you punish your dog ?
maybe your dog has learned it ' s lesson .
what happened on it ?
wow , sounds like you have good fi ##end ##s , and it was fun .
that ' s good . some people don ' t appreciate anything .
that ' s a blessing too . i happy that my family is healthy too .
oh no ! what happened ?
that is really ridiculous that they shut it off over just $ 1 though !
aw ##w , that ' s a nice story . i ' m glad you have that to carry with you .
i ' m thinking of a time that a party was thrown for me as a surprise . all those people getting together was really fun .
these nos ##tal ##gic emotions are unique and very pleasant to have . i sometimes re ##wind them in my mind just to escape from my anxiety
old memories that are good tend to help me emotionally and mentally . not those that were distress ##ing
did you ask why your partner refused . that is very weird .
that is okay , at least she was honest with you about her preferences .
i would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to .
i would like to think that i wouldn ' t but if it were that or die , i ' d eat .
what happened ? did you ?
that ' s perfect then , i ' m sure you did a great job @
tell me exactly what that was like ? hopefully it ' s different now ?
i could not even imagine how mad your parents must be .
nice ! i bet it is a very cute puppy .
that is just adorable ! you should take many photos before it grows too big !
yes i am mort ##ified jeans ripped
i am working
wo ##ah ! that is great news . have you told anyone yet ?
i don ' t blame you at all . you just received life changing news .
you are so right . it can make all the difference .
it is challenging to raise children . everybody could use a hand .
i feel the same way . there are so many people who are struggling now .
it ' s such a difficult situation that you just don ' t know where to begin .
great @ so you found out already that you got it or are you just confident ?
that is upset ##ting . i am sorry to hear that
ok you going to your family
no
that can be upset ##ting . did they tell you why ?
maybe it ' s time to look for another job .
that is impressive . why did you doubt them ?
is it something you are happy with ?
i hate interviews the most .
sure you can , work for yourself !
is there any emergency need for money ?
it ' s our responsibility to take care of our parents .
that is great ##1
you must have been so proud !
kids are amazing . how old are they ?
great ages to have lots of fun with .
that is fantastic . what for ?
that is awesome !
what does that mean exactly ?
i would love a vacation !
ps ##4 is the best system to play on !
i love beating others .
can you be more specific about what things you had lost in the past ?
so you consider yourself a general loser in life ?
i am with you . it is ho ##rre ##ndo ##us
i agree with you
is it still there ?
it sounds like that experience made a lot of amazing memories for you .
i can understand that . were you by yourself ?
that is good to hear
i wouldn ' t be so sure of that . even the best trained dogs can run when given a reason .
ha ha . they all are until they run .
that is nice . what show ?
that is really cool
because of the movie or where you were parked ?
it must have been really good to keep you scared afterwards .
that ' s awesome ! what was the project ?
you must be very clever
i just got netflix back . what is good ?
that sounds good .
oh no . that ##s sad . what was wrong ?
im sorry . that must have been hard ,
i could never ever sing .
i can barely even talk !
oh , what was your age when you ' ve stolen ?
it ' s happening all around . if we ' re repeating the same , it ' ll become a bad habit .
they may consider that shop ##lifting . it would be terrible to go to jail for grapes .
i think i would stop doing that . jail doesn ' t appeal to me .
cool . are they still the same ?
are you gonna get together again ?
did you party after ?
i part ##ied like crazy after graduation .
don ' t be da ##ft ! kids should never watch tv !
they have tv inside the school do they not ?
even i love anime and i stopped watching tv a few years ago , maybe i shall return .
why is that ?
well that ' s understand ##able .
what kind of job was it ?
oh wow ! i have actually worked there too
i love apple pie . i feel you .
you brought yourself . i am a glass half full type of lady lo ##l
you are lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship .
you have a strong foundation . even if she wave ##rs she will return .
we will see . don ' t worry so much .
good for you . i like a positive attitude .
i hate when that happens
being court ##eous isn ##t that hard . people just don ##t try
yeah ? what do you need to buy ?
how many kids do you have ?
cool what are you going to do ?
well that ##s good if its quiet .
why and what did happen ?
oh , be positive , try your best .
why ?
oh well it wasn ##t on purpose . people lose things .
really ? why ? they ' re so small .
oh no ! have you put traps down ?
ok . had any interviews yet ?
lo ##l . well good luck . job searches can be tough .
you will .
those are the kind you better keep a watch on . you never know what he might do .
don ' t engage with him he will think that your interested .
is the cow ##or ##ker your friend ?
you probably sho ##ulf have told them that wasn ##t a decent thing to do .
why
ok
i hope it is - do you have any funny experiences from the bad ones ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . you ' ll find somebody good soon !
really ? are you watching training ?
oh you mean soccer lo ##l
i will agree with you there . we use whatever words we want .
how exciting for you .
there ' s always hope in a new beginning .
what was the movie ? save me
well thanks for nothing lo ##l
i ' ve never had a pair either - but i don ' t des ##pis ##e them . why do you feel so strongly ?
yeah - i don ' t see why someone would spend so much either .
maybe we ' re just jealous !
wow . i have never even tried . seems complicated .
maybe i will try one day .
what do you make best ?
never even had it before .
cong ##rat ##s
ya i am interesting to help for people
that ' s a hard thing to deal with . do you think she ' s really hungry ?
maybe her body clock is out of w ##ha ##ck .
who ##s playing ?
om ##g . i love her .
do you have any of your own ?
i ' m sure you would with all that experience !
wow . was it inter ##sti ##ng ?
i have no idea who that is . sorry .
football or soccer ?
what ##s your favorite team ?
why do you hide snacks from your kids ?
that does not seem very nice .
that ' s good to hear .
that ' s good that you can get through and hopefully still care about each other .
i hope you can find the peace and keep up whatever friendship you may have .
that ' s great . i understand sometimes we might need distance as well . but being cool with the other person is nice to see .
right now ?
oh man ! i feel sorry for you . what time is it where you are - 1a ##m ?
what happened ?
shame on you .
oh wow . maybe you dodged a bullet .
me too lo ##l
is it ? do you like dressing up then ? or is it the tricks ?
you can make it every month ! have fancy dress parties for the kids
excellent !
did you have fun ?
i bet i enjoyed it when i was 30 and pregnant !
did you have any money ?
that ' s good he is nice like that .
what kind of test ?
biology isn ##t as easy as i thought either .
good luck . what ##s the job ?
cool . iv ##e done that before .
does she ? do you want me to break her knee ##cap ##s for you ?
me too . it ' s not fair . just message me her address and $ 1000 and i ' ll do it : - )
yeah ? i ' m sorry to hear that . are you looking for someone else ? ( does that sound sl ##ea ##zy , lo ##l ? )
oh dear . maybe you don ' t need a man - i ' m one and can confirm that they are messy , noisy and rude .
it sure can .
definitely
i hate that .
people should be more consider ##ate though .
je ##esh , was she not paying attention in class , or is there some other issue ?
i couldn ' t imagine my kid going so far as to hide something like that from me . maybe she was just scared of how you would react .
well you tend to be a bit overly serious about things , maybe you should try looking at the issue from her point of view you know ?
she is a kid man , kids mess up . i can ' t imagine you were a beacon of honesty when you were a kid .
that ##s cool .
oh . you ' re welcome lo ##l
i read your journal
im sl ##do in your closet
really ? why is that ?
oh no ! how does that make you feel ?
i know right
i know exactly what you mean .
why are you done with voting ?
you shouldn ' t give up on your government .
i hate horror films too many nightmares .
whose idea were those anyway ?
oh no
that was nice .
probably im scared of birds .
it flies . i am afraid of butterflies . seriously
well its to be expected , all you do is sit in your house on the weekends .
well next weekend come out with me and the rest of the group , bet we could find you a few interested guys .
well lets not aim too high . how about we start with good looking and go from there .
oh shoot ! what happened , are you okay ?
what happened ? i thought you guys were attached at the hip ?
i feel really sorry for you . will you be okay ?
i hope everything works out for you .
that ' s nice , do you get nervous ?
that ' s great , do you have a warm up routine to get your ready ?
cool , what do you do if you happen to be low on energy ?
makes sense !
oh why ?
was it an important appointment ?
i haven ' t seen it , but i know a lot of people like it .
sounds good , were you said throughout the series or because of an ending ?
i appreciate that ! i wish i had watched it so you could talk more about it .
what about it is annoying ? isn ##t it better for the dog ?
that does not seem safe for anyone . is there anything you can do about it ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . are you ok ?
oh man . that ' s so sad .
that sounds like fun .
i love the sunshine , it ' s great .
why is that ?
i can understand that viewpoint . it ' s a very complicated issue though !
well done ! do you get a prize or anything ?
that ' s great . keep up the good work
why do you think you often feel that way ?
do you have any friends around that area ?
why is that ?
that is annoying .
that is wonderful , good food makes for happy people
that ##s my favorite food too ! no wonder it was lovely . you should cook italian food often then
why not ? that doesn ' t sound fun .
i ' m sorry the hear that , maybe next time .
absolutely . what happened ?
that ' s bad . did any charges get pressed ?
what kind of job do you want ?
accounting jobs are usually high paying j .
oh , wow . that ' s awful , i ' m sorry !
i understand . will your insurance help you ?
what was the hard work ?
good . well done then .
wow ! never mind , the best is reserved for the last
don ' t give up !

that is unfortunate . you must have really angry to have wasted your time .
it has happened to me as well . its very annoying when it happens .
what did he do to you ?
you should not lend money to anyone , even if it is your friend
really - are you scared of missing it ?
me too - i get very stressed if there ' s even a chance of being late .
that shouldn ' t be allowed in the first place .
oh my . i would be angry if that happened too .

uh ##mm ##nn ! that ' s awful !
what game were you playing ?
wow , i am so happy for you !

it is very much worth it in the long run .

i can imagine so
i am in the us . why does it make you so angry ? i ' ve never heard about .
i think i will , i ' m very curious now . you think they would want to use their time more wise ##ly .
oh man that ' s a good way to end up on the couch .
you better find a way to make that up to her .
why is that ? is it your favorite type of car ?
i see , turn that jealousy into motivation to get that ac ##ura !
congratulations . we have a boy on the way . 3 months to go !
i remember my surprise too . she tricked me all day and said she wasn ' t pregnant .
well , that really bad !
well , that goodness you were not caught , that would have been expulsion
the customized version of what ?
oh okay . what kind of car is it ?
oh wow that seems like a bad situation .
is there another company that may be able to help you ?
what a happy time i bet you were very pro ##uo ##d and excited ! ! : -
ya ##y that is awesome ! sometimes not knowing the gender of the baby is a very cool surprise they say .
nice ! what is your favorite dish that she taught you ?
aw ##w ##w i am sorry . at least she showed you how to make it !
oh wow . that sounds like me and my husband !
that would make me mad , too . how hard is it to throw stuff away ?
that makes me so sad . why is that so ?
yes that can be a huge problem . i ' m so sorry you ' re having to go through that .
of course , i ' ve felt sad for many reasons . things that happen in the world make me sad .
what makes me sad is hunger in the world . i cannot stand people suffering .
that is a reason to be sad but also to be furious
all people are the same . i understand why you feel ve ##r sad and i guess frustrated too
sorry to hear that . why is that ?
that must have been very upset ##ting . it happened to me back in 6th grade .
so did you get in trouble for it ?
that would make me so mad ! i wouldn ' t even want to go to work !
that is pretty gross but it happens often .
if you plan on having a kid it will happen .
that sounds like so much fun !
i like the little roller coaster ##s myself .
have they offered to buy you a replacement ?
that ##s not a very good friend then . accidents happen but you should own up to them : / have you considered sui ##ng in small claims ? you ##d at least get your money back to get a new phone
sorry to hear that . is she going to be under treatment ?
that ##s pretty kind of you . what is the doctor saying ?
yes , they are . they keep us motivated .
my main one is to become a mother . i also want to be out of debt asa ##p .
have you talked to him about being a bit cleaner in general ?
ah that ' s a tough situation . maybe some subtle hints would work best , like leaving a de ##od ##ori ##zer near his room .
oh that sounds like fun ! what kind of film did you see ?
action films on the big screen are very exciting with the loud sounds and visual effects ! !
do you want to do something special today ?
you can read something
that must ' ve been hard . i love my dad the most of all family members
i ' m glad to hear that .
what did happen in the store ? why did your daughter throw a fit ?
oh , did you convince her ?

i bet i would be too
oh cool how much was it ?
holy ! that ##s a lot but she will get good use out of it
tell me more about this
oh my god
well done . you must be very proud of him .
football is pretty much the only sport i like .
how did you feel , relieved or disappointed ?
did they res ##ched ##ule ?
and what happened then ?
cong ##rat ##s . you must be very proud of yourself .
what did you do instead ?
well you could always take him out or do something he would like to make up for it im sure he won ##t mind
i am sure that brought back memories
i do love those kind of memories
what are you worried about ?
ah ##h , well i am sure you will have blast !

that happens to everyone
i hope she for ##ga ##ve you

i ' ve been there . that must be rough . what ' s going on ?
i am happy you worked it out . stay loyal to each other . it ' s the most important thing
what are you overwhelmed by
i am sure it will begin soon
om ##g . . sounds terrible . . do you usually get storms like that in your area ?
it sounds like it well i am glad everyone is okay
i ' m sorry , how did she take it ?
hopefully she will forgive you for it .
it must have been quite interesting . did it make you feel hungry ?
oh my , i can see why . it must have been very noisy and animal - like
then ?
where are you camping ?
who did ? and i ' m sorry to hear that .
i am sorry for your loss .
that ##s a terrible situation you are in has it been resolved ?
yeah that sounds really bad !
i see , it will be alright . you just have to be positive !
you must be feel a bit guilty , but that ##s okay
how long did he study for ?
awesome good for him . . . what will his career choice me now ?
i am sure they will do fine
she sounds creative
that is an example of an awesome parent . it is good to know he has got your back !
i am sure it really helped your self confidence and feelings of worth .
that sounds so annoying
just be civil as much as you can
well , it is a good thing you had so much faith in your father .
it is good you had someone so reliable in your life .
i bet you were good at it
that is pretty impressive
oh wow . have you ever been in a tor ##ando ?
people tend to say that . . . which makes me more curious and wanting to be in one ha ##ha
i ' m sorry , i think it ' s an opportunity to start a new job better
that ' s right . . . but you have to keep going . . . i know that you will do well
. . . i cong ##rat ##ulate you . . . it ' s good news !
that gives a lot of confidence . . . .
i believe this story please tell me ore
such a manly thing to do don ##t you agree ?
so . . . what did you do
smart
that sounds like a blast . who are you going to see ?
that is fun , is it an inside thing or outside ?
w ##ha ##aa ##t that is insane ! alright he must be doing something really legal right ? lo ##l
some people really are like that though . i am not one of those people tho .
i agree but you do not need much in life to be happy if you are a content person
i am happy for you
maybe , but maybe not . i bet it would be a lot of fun to have such a nice pool if you had the money for it .
i mean i would never be able to afford that but if they can then it is nothing for them to do the routine care .
did he ?
you have a great dad
wow i closed 2 weeks ago
it truly is
were you drunk ?
lo ##l well at ##lea ##st you are honest !
hope he takes care of it
you are a good friend , i would never let my friend borrow mine
that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty ! u ##gh
probably so either way still disgusting
well , go ahead , know that women are an art , that you get many attempts
quiet , we ' re like that . . . you ' re right
you ' re not alone i ' ve got a bunch of debt to pay off
for now i just sweep it under the rug and pretend like it doesn ' t exist . so after that point my life is pretty much perfect
i am so proud of you , keep it up
you are probably older now as well
sometimes you ' ve gotta live with regrets . accept it as part of your past life and move on
same i ' ve put my parents through a lot . but now i ' m trying to be the best version of myself so i can eventually pay them back
that is a very positive way to think i wish i could think like you
ill try my best and see where it gets me
i know , it ' s awful ! how much did your rent go up ?
wow . . . you need to find a new place to live because that ' s completely unreasonable .
that ' s gross ! did you complain to your landlord ?
wow , that ' s pretty bad . i would complain to someone higher up , because that ' s just disgusting !
you sound so motivated , that ' s really great ! i believe in you
it does mo ##tiv ##ate me too !
i do remember that and i think there is a lot of nostalgia there
i love things that remind me of my childhood , it is even more fun to share it with our kids
really ! what was it ?
that sounds amazing ! what was in the box ? ? ?
i think most people are really . anything specific about it ?
yeah , that ' s a scary thought . i try to think about what i can leave behind , and hope there ' s something past death .
oh , that ' s awful . what will you do to make it right ?
yeah , i think that ' s a good idea . i hope it all turns out for good .
oh no ! it seems as though everything turned our ok , right ? i am sure you were strong !
that is great ! it was all worth it in the end .
oh my ! i am glad to hear you managed to avoid the collision .
young people never appreciate the danger of speeding .
what are you getting done
ou ##ch , ga ##rg ##le some whiskey
give her an unlocked phone
is she being billed for data though ?
that ' s not nice of them . is that parking lot assigned to you ?
they should be nice ##r ! i ' m sorry they are so inc ##ons ##ider ##ate
wow , you ' re so well spoken .
so how do you better yourself ?
maybe there is rain in the forecast
probably a lot are on vacation , especially now .
i ' m sorry to hear that . did they replace the plant as well ?
i hope it comes back . fe ##rti ##lizer is always an experimental thing . plants are so fin ##ick ##y .
oh wow ! i remember my parents getting them so much . why would someone need that now ?
possibly , but i doubt it could be worth anything . i would have thrown it out .
did you cry ?
i love the old days as well
oh my , that must have been super embarrassing . did you get red faced ?
did you ask for her number afterwards ?
that seemed nice of her , maybe she felt bad about something ?
oh so she gave you money to kind of persuade you to do it ?
uh ##hh i know how you feel ! ! we have some young neighbors downstairs and sometimes they have late night parties in their apartment
tell me about it . i even talked to them several times but they don ' t care
that must have been amazing to see ! did you try to scare it away or just watch it ? be careful since it sounds like it may be dangerous .
wow ! definitely be careful then !
that was some bonus . if you go to i think south carolina , they have a factory somewhere there and they are cheaper i think
a friend got one used down there near spartan ##burg .
aw , well i ' m sure a child that young doesn ' t really need it .
well maybe you can practice and get better at it for when your baby is older .
that ##s good . one should always appreciate family .
i see , healthy relationships should be cher ##ished !
that is fair , i would be as well
i under ##ts ##tan ##d that , i would be very upset as well
that is cool though , does it still run fine ?
wow , that is a good run though , great job keeping it running !
it will
sure
sorry to hear that . i have lost all my grandparents so i know the feeling .
yeah , it takes a long time to get over . and it ' s never easy .
that is so sad , humans made a huge impact on animals lives in that sense
it makes me feel sick as well , i hit a bird once and almost cried
that ' s great . it seems that everything is going well for you .
thanks . i guess you are quite happy about everything .
wow i am happy for you
around christmas right
i am as ##pr ##ii ##ng to be one , cong ##rat ##s !
not yet , i am still young
i know how you feel . i have siblings as well . they are quite important and give life meaning .
that is a great attitude and outlook to have !
i am so sorry to hear that !
i un ##sd ##ers ##tan ##d that entirely
i ' ve been there , it can really suck to be lonely . it sounds like you ' re doing better though : )
i ' m glad to hear it . it ' s great to have found someone .
why is that ?
weren ' t we are like that . . .
that will be a ton of fun to play ! i re ##me ##me ##ber when the first one came out , what a blast . now i have to go get a switch !
what is your favorite game ?
i would imagine , that is a huge event ! my favorite game was ze ##lda by the way
you should , there are tons of age appropriate games like mario ka ##rt and sp ##lat ##oon !
sounds interesting . i ' d love to check that out !
it ' s a mario - type game , isn ' t it ?
le ##bron is preparing for life after basketball therefore he picked la , he achieved what he wanted
he doesn ' t have anything else to prove to anyone
mine too . how many do you have ?
aw ##w ##w , a 1 year old . i miss when my daughter was that young .
maybe he was not watching where he was going
at least he didn ##t hit you
tha ##q ##t is too bad . i like cats , but not the mean ones , only the sweet ones . what does the cat do that is so bad ?
yeah , i wonder what has made it so mean .
hi , that ' s sad . have you tried looking for facebook events ? like local events . i bet you can meet people there
you can always talk to me . i ' m here for you
it is a interesting and relaxing way to end a evening . iv ##e been there before .
sorry to hear that . all we can do is learn from it , really .
oh my go ##sh , how terrible . did you have them saved on your computer ?
i guess you had to red ##o it all again ?
that is terrible , is it someone you like ? or did you not even know her ? i don ' t know which is worse .
can you laugh about it now that you look back at it , or has not enough time passed yet ?
oh my , did you find out who it was ?
you must have been quite re ##li ##ved that it was just your dog !
that is a relief iv ##e been in a simi ##lia ##r situation . i know its hard to bring yourself out of a hole , i can barely see the light at the end of the tunnel ##l
im struggling myself , with 5 kids and 1 big kid ( my husband ) i feel like i should just buy a farm to be able to keep up . lo ##l
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hate when my wife and i argue . are you feeling any better ? did you have a chance to talk to your husband after that ?
i hope everything will go back to normal asa ##p and i hope he will apologize for making you feel small
holy cow , why did you take that bet ?
what was the bet about ?
good for you , healthy relationships are the best part about life !
i agree , going through life alone would be boring !
that is awesome , i am trying my best these days
that is good , that takes a lot of work !
did you drink a lot back then > :
i am glad you are in a better place now
that ' s awesome ! it sounds like your life is going pretty smoothly : ) any big plans ?
oh awesome ! did you buy a house ?
when you feel rain . . . sometimes you feel its magic . . . ask the children
you ' re right . . . then the umbrella always at hand
of everything , there is always something to learn
good luck with your learning
did y ##0 ##u get it ?
awesome does it pay well ?
how young were you ?
that is not bad then , that is being a kid
sounds like your life is perfect . that ' s amazing . i ' m happy for you
where do you work ?
that is amazing , that is a huge life event !
that is crazy how time flies like that ! next thing you know he will have a girlfriend
blood is blood .
that is correct . it painful to see your loved ones been hurt
why is that ?
wow , cong ##rat ##s , i know that is not a fun process at all , so great job !
indeed . that is the whole purpose of getting a degree and education . isn ' t it ?
well , it can also depend of your communication skills and how you can en ##tic ##e employers
that is great , is it far from home ?
that is not bad at all , best of luck with that !
that is a lot to be thankful for ! you must be feeling really good !
that is a great place to be . count your blessings !
really
which system was it ? my message got cut short , but i love nintendo , the switch is amazing !
i bet you did and i ' m sure you got the job
what do you do
how far away is that ? i have never heard of it !
oh , that should be awesome , have a great time !
oh man , so sorry dude . hope your coping .
why did she break up with you ? was it a long term relationship ?
i agree , i often re ##mini ##sc ##e about my childhood .
you just have to stay positive dude , happiness is a relative concept .
audi ##s are nice cars . what color is it ? does it look newer ?
oh , nice . do you have a car ?
that is very thoughtful of you
you are very ambitious
about what may i ask ?
is the person someone you know well , a long time friend , a family member ?
i would talk to your brother and let him know how concerned you are and ask him for re ##ass ##urance
that ' s so nice of them ! was it a surprise party ?
ha ##ha ##ha we take those things for granted ! happy bela ##ted birthday !
i can imagine it caught many people off guard . i hope everyone came out ok in the end .
that ' s good . the only thing that matters in the end is our lives and health .
its never too late
i for one have not start saving yet
according to my knowledge and understanding , i believe that you did something really pr ##ude ##nt
mode ##ration in driving is important to avoid dangerous situations
oh my that must be em ##bar ##res ##ing
well that sounds more pleasant
is that your brew ##ski of choice
always been a fan of corona though lately i ' ve been chu ##gging hurricanes and keystone ##s
oh , i bet you are nervous . i ' m sure she will be okay but i would be so ne ##r ##vus
that ' s great ! i see you trust her so much , you have wonderful relationship with her
it ' s alright maybe it ' s a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday
did you check everywhere in the room ? maybe she has a surprise gift hidden somewhere for you to find out
i think you should call the cab company and try to locate the driver !
yes i will pray as well . but try not to let it bite your conscience .
but that ' s so exciting ! you will have so many good moments in your new house
i understand . is your new house far from the old one ?
i understand that , i hate bugs , even alive ones
i get that , i am the same way
that is very sweet . i assume you guys are close .
that is great that you have that kind of relationship .
was your house okay ?
good , being safe is all you can ask for !
my boyfriend just bought a nintendo switch last week . it was expensive !
i will have to ask him about the super smash bro ' s game . most likely he ' s looking forward to it as well !
he was dirty and i had to bath ##e him very thoroughly .
i am so happy for you
do well my friend
blood ' s thicker than water , whether you like it or not
tell me why
that sounds fun though , i am a lightweight , after about 5 drinks i am about out of it
i like vodka , but mixed with stuff to kill the taste , i hate beer though , it is nasty to me
you should go
it could have been worse you know
that is great ! i bet they are thrilled ! is that you favorite team ?
they are pretty talented .
that sucks . it ' s the same for me , only it ' s because we recently moved and i don ' t know anyone outside of work yet .
ou ##ch . were you too busy to go with them ?
are they alive or gone ?
yes they will believe in it
i know that was the case for many , i am sorry that impacted you
many people did , he was a like ##able fellow !
that has happened to me , kids are brutal
that is for sure , with online bullying existing now too
that makes me sad to hear . do you have lot ' s of friends now ?
i think it is better to a few really good friends than a lot of acquaintances .
glad you ' re doing well
what are three traits that got you to where you are now
nice talking to ya
i love nintendo and that series
what system do you have
how old were you ?
ah okay , that makes sense , at least it was sort of legal !
oh my that ##s pretty funny
ha ##ha ##ha you are funny
oh wow that was brave . did you get caught ?
that was pretty risky . did you get sick ?
i saw one for the first time ever too ! where did you see it at ?
i was in the us when i saw it thought it has been a while since it happened .
well that ' s good news .
what kind of work do you do
well you shouldn ' t fear things we have no control over anyway . i ' m sorry you feel anxiety over this .
i guess i can agree with that . i don ' t like it when people critic ##ize mill ##enia ##lls too much though . baby boom ##ers didn ' t do that great either .
why ? what happened ? ?
that stink ##s . are there any other possibilities for advancement coming up ?
i know the feeling . i miss my 2 boys also
i imagine , but i am sure the family will be reunited soon .
why do you think people would be that ir ##res ##pon ##sible ?
not all people would be that way , and i think for the most part most people would take responsibility for their actions .
uh oh . did he ruin some furniture ?
that is too bad . i bet you were not happy .
my brother did too ! he ' s the oldest so he got all the good stuff : (
aw : ( i bet other people appreciate you a lot !
i hear you . jokes are one thing , family is another .
i dunn ##o if i ' d go quite that far , but you do you : p
i bet you were glad you made that purchase !
that was very lucky timing .
it is so frustrating when someone else ' s issues affect your life . what does she do to make you late ?
that might be a good solution for you . let her catch all the fl ##ack for her tar ##dine ##ss .
that is absolutely horrible ! was this recent ?
i agree . you should bring that up to hr .
seems like this speech was very important to you , why ?
ah - ah , than it makes a lot of sense .
that ' s awesome ! are you excited ?
how long did it take you to make it ?
that ' s an unfortunate pre ##dic ##ament to be in . what did you end up doing ?
that ' s a tough decision for sure , but you definitely can ' t get fired for something like that , and kids are exposed to ge ##rm ##s all the time .
i get nostalgia all the time . were they family pictures
cool . do you still keep in touch with those friends
that is a good approach ! has it been successful ?
that is great to hear ! i am happy for you !
its really more di ##sa ##pp ##onte ##d and hurts a lot .
don ##t feel everything goes good
yeah that good
ia ##m always happy to think about it . my childhood memory was a great part of our life
nice ! where at
cool traveling what are your plans so far
ah , i ' ve made plenty of dumb choices in my life too . honestly , i think it ' s part of being young
that ' s good : ) but you are the wise ##r for it
i know . the game was full of int ##rigue . they truly deserved the win
you should definitely get a tattoo of his name on your chest
i am so sorry to hear that . losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life .
maybe they just need some time to let the emotions settle a bit .
sounds fun how long were you there
aw what was your favorite things to do while there
congratulations . what did you get your degree in ?
good luck with any future business ventures .
i am very sorry for your loss .
a loss is never easy especially one in the family .
that is so cool , what kind of video game was it ?
that is so amazing . are you a professional gamer ?
i wish i was that good at gaming . what a fun way to make a living !
that is a great news , cong ##rat ##ulate him from my side too . what is the major ?
if the journey is tough then you are in the right path . so , she is heading in right way . great .
nice ! what did you whip up today
i love steak . . just had some steak , brisk ##et and fa ##jit ##as yesterday
that ##s an amazing memory to have , have you since visited her or sent her a card ?
i would call the school and see if they can disclose that or maybe they can accept the card from you to give to her !
how did it go ?
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! i hope you could pull your grade up !
what a nice person you are ! i bet she appreciate ##s you
you have a good set of morals . that ' s becoming more uncommon lately . so , good on you !
i am sure the stress will be worth it in the end . just keep encouraging him !
those are good traits to have . good for him !
it is a great desire that you can achieve , just rely on your abilities to independently do what you know .
i wish you can achieve success in your projects .
did you present ?
that is great !
is it something you enjoy ?
i know we are all different but maybe getting another puppy would help ?
oh that is so scary ! i bet you were terrified !
were you unharmed though ?
lo ##l , i think my son has done that , he use to em ##bra ##sse me when i would go to the store when he was little by crying a lot
no any more he is a lot older and does pretty good on his own , but the thing is he is always close by if we in the store together . yes i do believe that the human are weird
i ' m guessing you ' re talking about your son ?
parenting is hard , respect to you and your patience
that is awful ! i hate people who leave their dogs out all day . that ' s no life for a dog to live at all .
that is terrible . i don ' t know why people like that bother getting a pet .
that is so beautiful ! how old is she ?
i bet it was om ##g that ##s so adorable
that is so scary . . . . you must have been terrified your baby too ! how are you doing today ?
i can ##t even begin to imagine honestly im sorry you had to experience that
that is horrible ! how could they justify doing that ? you must have been disgusted with them !
i can imagine . i hope it all works out for the best and that you are able to come away from this as a stronger person .
cong ##rat ##s . they must be excited .
i am sorry to hear that . why are you upset about this ?
that is terribly sad . i volunteer at our local shelter . i just love dogs .
that is so happy to hear ! it ' s the nice things like that that make it worth it to volunteer .
wow , i bet that was a really big deal ! what was it about ?
i hope he did well .
i think a lot of people are . what in particular aston ##ish ##es you ?
yes , he ' s definitely unpredictable and cap ##ric ##ious . is there anything about him you do like ?
oh wow that must have kept you awake for a while !
she scared me too , i hope you ' re not scarred for life !
i know that feeling . it ' s a trip when i look through family albums
do you still keep in touch with the ho ##mies
i would enjoy the peace and quiet ! kick back , relax , and do whatever you want .
well in that case i hope they come home soon . my family is just annoying mostly .
i have not , i was hoping they called you instead .
that sounds like good planning to me .
i do too . i don ' t like to think about it because i start to feel weird .
that is awesome . things change a lot out of high school .
great . did you decided were to go on your vacation ##s ?
i have been there before . your are gonna have a lot of fun .
what exactly were you referring to
oh try to politely get the truth by speaking in a diplomatic manner by not hurting her ego
that ' s great ! how old is she ?
if she is really good she could get a scholarship .
why did she get sick ? what was wrong ?
oh no , i ' m sorry ! i hope she is feeling better , and you are too !
yeah me too . they are unbelievable .
yeah it is hard to imagine how they pulled that off .
great . i hope you have a lot of fun .
5 years is a long time . you have a lot to catch - up .
wow , how did he get so much money if he didn ' t have money to pay his fees , and what were the fees for ?
what a great job to get .
it must have been an overwhelming experience , how old are the kids now ?
sweet , we all miss those memories of them growing back . mine are adults now
why did you feel irritated ?
oh that sounds super annoying ! sorry for that !
that is so sad ! that poor dog .
oh it survived ! what a lucky dog .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . the only thing that helps is time unfortunately .
after some time passes though , you ' ll wonder why you were so sad .
i think he should exercise more self - restraint when it comes to your relationship
that is very dangerous attitude to have . i would be very cautious as it may bring much un ##int ##ended social consequences
do you act surprised ?
did you drink a lot ?
how does he go about showing it off ?
that sounds really childish of him lo ##l
did you apologize , and do something nice to make up for it ?
wow ! well , everyone makes mistakes , and if you apologized and bought her a ring , that should about cover it , lo ##l .
you should be proud of the fact you have a new home to build a lifetime of memories in .
you all have reason to celebrate . you should throw a huge party to thank them .
wow ! cong ##rat ##s ! i ' ve heard that ' s very difficult to do .
good for you . do you feel any different health wise ?
oh yeah ? what job did you apply for ?
that ' s great ! i really hope you do get it , you sound very excited .
cool what did you get ?
nice , what brand was it ?
i ' ve only heard a little about them but they ' re a good brand ! did you get it yet or are you still waiting ?
that sounds like fun ! i love family time !
yes it sure is ! we must appreciate the things that money can ##t buy too !
oh that is so scary ! what happened after ?
oh no . i hope everything worked out okay !
nice ! did you use that extra to do anything special ?
that ' s probably the best choice . i was thinking you could use it to spruce up a new place a bit , which it sounds like you did : )
that sounds like a really fun and joy ##ful surprise . young birthday ##s are amazing .
yeah , after 21 they really are pointless . most of my birthday ##s , i enjoy a good dose of work all day , lo ##l .
i think that would be a very wise idea .
are you working a full time job ?
i am sorry to hear that . i know that would be hard .
i hope things get better for you .
did you try to reason with them ?
you should report them to the authorities
that ##s so awesome . . . . . . . what un ##i is it ?
impressive my god ! you really must be so proud . . .
yeah i love that feeling , you need to cher ##ish it !
that ' s good , try to figure out what caused it !
god . . . . did you have any extra clothes or able to change ?
sounds like a good reason to leave maybe i should spill juice on myself too lo ##l
cool cong ##rat ##s , what did you eat ?
well a promotion is always good . did you have a burr ##ito ?
a dog is an awesome gift for a little kid . i bet you were super excited .
i bet ! maybe i should get my kids a dog for christmas , i know it would be a great choice for them .
trim ##ming down on the junk food ?
oh okay i see . i understand , being healthy is important . i hope you are being sensitive to her feelings though , weight can be a touch ##y subject !
your husband is just being a good daddy ha ##ha ##ha you will miss the experience when the kid grows up
then talk with him , try to reason with him
that sucks , but being lonely can sometimes help you discover new ho ##bbies .
yes , your happiness doesn ' t depend on nobody else .
that ' s no fair ! where you left out on purpose ?
yeah i would be upset about that too .
what orchestra was it or where was it ?
sounds very cool id love to go listen someday
turbulence always scares me lo ##l . in reality the plane is very safe though .
how often do you fly ? the more you do it the easier it gets .
cool i lived in palm beach county for 2 years . i fly to the philippines every few years and it takes over 12 hours !
that is so sad . it sucks to end any relationship .
that seems like a pretty crazy reason to throw away four years . i am sorry that happened to you .
i feel your pain . it ' s crazy how reckless some drivers can be . i was always taught the importance of using my signals .
honestly in florida i see similar behaviors among some drivers . i ' m not sure if they are rushing or just don ' t care .
that ' s cool i guess . . . do your parents not trust you in their own house ? lo ##l
got ##cha . well glad it worked out for ya
someone forget to pay the bill ?
that is a very good story
i bet . that ' s so sweet .
were you able to record the moment ?
that ' s unfortunate , did you end up with a ticket ?
ou ##ch , i hope it wasn ' t too expensive .
i haven ##t played video games in years i really need to buy a system but i don ##t even know where to begin now ada ##ys lo ##l
i liked it better when it said re ##lea ##sh i figured you had a li ##sp . ( lo ##l joking ) i will check into it ! thanks
did you need the money for something specific ?
were you able to sleep last night ?
did you get hurt ?
glad to hear that .
i always get nervous too . . . never know what they will find right ! what ##s wrong ?
je ##ez thank god ! u ##gh glad you are okay
i can understand , the holidays are exciting , almost there though .
i hope it ' s worth the wait !
that is nice of you . family is great to have when you get older .
yes it is . i am glad you are there for your grandmother !
oh no , that is really sad . you should research your dog ' s all ##er ##gies so that it does not happen with other foods .
that is great ! i hope your dog gets better fast .
oh i bet that was super frustrating ! how did you react ?
younger siblings tend to be that way sometimes .
great where are you going ?
i agree , it ' s better to over ##pack than under ##pack .
i am so sorry to hear that ! don ' t worry . i know it is hard but every day will get better .
just be strong . she is in a better place now .
how exciting ! why did you choose ta ##hiti ?
the photos of ta ##hiti ##an beaches i ' ve seen are beautiful ! will you be visiting a beach ?
oh no ! was she okay , or did she cry ?
that is good , i ' m glad she was okay . i once got hit in the face with one , so i know it can sting .
i am sorry to hear that . can i ask why ?
i don ' t think you should feel ashamed at all . parent ' s are there to help you until you are able to manage on your own .
and how do you feel about it ? are you ready ?
then that ' s good ! i am glad you feel confident , that will help !
that is a great idea ! i need to do that as well , seems i always forget something !
that is great ! i ' m happy for you !
oh no , i hope it wasn ' t un ##war ##rant ##ed !
it ' s definitely a difficult position to be in , i hope your cow ##or ##kers were understanding .
om ##g , how many months were you pregnant before this happened ?
i ' m so sorry to hear about this
oh that is a tough one ! you have to tell her no matter what ! just suck it up and break it to her !
i know you are scared , but this was a choice you made , now you have to deal with the consequences .
we will always have fond memories that come to our minds . i am sorry to hear that but also happy you can have the memo ##ru .
yes she is !
what was the prize you didn ' t win ?
oh well i ' m sure there ' s always next year ! was it a fitness test or what
it is good you are happy with your current position . what do you do ?
that is awesome ! i ' m happy for you !
wow , it must be a very recent and trend ##y hair style
you husband must be very happy with the style
i understand a lot of people have issues with him . what makes you embarrassed ?
well in his business dealings in the past it probably served him well to be blunt and ag ##ress ##ive . i can see how that would bother some people
i am sorry to hear that . is the po ##ili ##ce helping you .
you should install security cameras around your house .
that is so nice . mom ##s are the best . you are lucky to have a good one !
i definitely will ! my mom is sick , so i plan on spending all the time with her i can !
that ' s so good for you ! are you going to save more money now ?
i can imagine ! i hope you ' re able to save a lot and have good financial security .
do i even wanna hear it ? okay tell me . . . what happened ? : o
so you had chocolate covered ants ! i bet that ##s price ##y somewhere in another country ! ha ha
oh man did you forget ?
well hopefully she understands too , you seem pretty guilty about it .
that ' s sounds like a very smart and effective safety pre ##ca ##ution . was it enough to adequately defend your family ?
did you end up feeling like you had stronger defenses than the hurricane had strength when it reached your area ? i mean in an over ##pro ##tec ##ted kind of way .
that is really sad . many people i grew up with have passed from overdose . it ' s tragic .
i don ' t believe it is either . i ' m so sorry to hear about your friend .
that is great . did you buy anything else ?
so you have relatively new computer essential ##s . sounds like you are set for the next while .
that sounds cool , what did the circus consist of ? did they have elephants ?
cool ! i haven ' t been to a circus in years . i think i should go again soon .
that ' s pretty cool . it always helps to have someone helping you when you ' re sick .
i had a girlfriend who was really caring . baked me a birthday cake , made me a scarf , and bought me clothes . . . but i messed it up and we ' re no long together but you live and you learn
oh man , do you miss it ? how about your brother ?
oh yeah that ' s way too cold ! i ' m sorry you feel a bit homes ##ick . remember you are away because you are better ##ing yourself
ou ##ch ! that had to feel embarrassing ! did you apologize ?
that ' s good . that shows your true character .
wow ! that never happens ! you must have been so excited !
i would have bought more tickets hoping i was having good luck after that !
that ' s sucks . you must have been devastated when you got the news .
you ' ll get over it . they ' re probably up in heaven watching over you now .
i am too actually . i don ' t care for them at all !
they ' re obsessed with guns , what do you expect ?
are you ok ? how is your recovery ?
you are lucky to have a top - notch doctor helping you .
that ' s great , from the sound of it , your probably thought it was going to be boring , huh ?
that must have been very entertaining to watch then . i ' m glad you enjoyed it so much .
oh no , are you feeling any better now ? or are you still having problems ?
oh , well that sounds like a step in the right direction at least . i hear vocational school is great for many different kind of jobs , usually more physical .
that is very risky and volatile ! with no risk , there is no reward ! i am root ##ing for you !
that is a good position to be in . there have been millionaire ##s made in cry ##to ##cu ##rre ##ncy .
oh wow ! what ' s better than a raise ? a raise you didn ' t even expect !
is it a pretty substantial increase ?
that ' s great . i bet she ' s never home now .
i know , time fly ' s by so fast . cong ##rat ##s to her . just tell her to be careful on the road .
i am happy to hear that ! any specific reasons ?
wow that is a huge achievement ! any parent would be proud .
that could happen to anyone . don ' t feel so bad .
keep trying and you will see imp ##rov ##ments .
what about friend ?
but what about ?
that ' s good launch you ga ##t ter ##e
ok that is cool
oh man , that sucks . you may need to say something to her .
hopefully . maybe she was having a bad day .
wow ! that must ' ve been a surprise
she must ' ve really enjoyed the time . where did you guys go out to eat ? was it nice ?
sounds cool ! there isn ' t anything like that around here .
wow that is a lot of money ! cong ##rat ##s !
if all else fails , save it !
wow ! that must have been exciting . were you nervous ?
oh , that sucks ! did you relax a bit after take off or were you anxious the whole time ?
well , you should . you did a nasty thing .
that really does not make a lot of sense .
what about it ?
really ? that seems to be an amazing event
i ' m not sure . what baby is it ?
yeah , that ' s my baby . it learned to roll over after about 5 months .
that ' s horrible ! i hope it wasn ' t a lot of money !
that ' s happened to me before . i hate trying to get things like that settled .
oh my god that ' s terrible ! so sad . i ' d be mad too . what did you do ?
did the police come ? i hope she got her stuff back
no kidding . i would hate for that to happen to anyone else .
i bet . the world can be so scary ! i ' m glad she was okay
that ' s cool ! it ' s nice to have someone close that is talented like that and can help with those things .
i always wish i was good at design . i ' ve tried , but i ' m pretty garbage , ha ##ha !
i used to play madden a lot so i understand the excitement . it is a fun game
i do enjoy football , it means that fall is right around the corner and i love the weather
me too , god bless air conditioning
true , heat makes me angry
i used to collect too when i was a kid , i still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia .
oh oh i got you neat ! so stuff you used to play in as a kid . that is nice of you , sports equipment can be expensive
oh sure , i played football in high school and still have my letter jacket and one really messed up jersey . i don ##t think i would ever get rid of them
college in general tends to be a lot of fun . anything in particular ?
sounds like a grand old time .
why can ' t you just move away when they smoke ?
that seems like a rather complicated situation than .
have you heard how she ' s doing at her new job ?
yeah , that sounds hard . : / i ' m sorry you ' re missing her .
oh that sounds ominous !
that sounds scary ! i hope it all ended okay !
oh man i hate when that happens . . . did you dry it off or change to a new pair ?
dan ##g that sucks . you should check out the brand mi ##zz ##en and main , i heard it on a tim ferris ##s podcast once . . . dress shirts and pants that wi ##ck away moisture like under ##arm ##our
i can absolutely see where you ' re coming from ! growing up my parents were neither wealthy nor very poor , but i feel like i had a great childhood .
i live pretty minimal ##ist . i have the things i need to enjoy life , like a home gym and a gaming computer while being able to afford living essential ##s . it doesn ' t take much for me to be happy .
how fun ! that must have been scary to do that !
that is true ! i bet it is taking a lot of time , you must be exhausted !
not very good . my insurance might not cover the damages .
someone scratched my car and slashed my tires .
that is impressive . you must have a super memory .
i know . i was just being sarcastic with you .
i ' m sorry to hear that , do you have positive memories that you can remember them with at least ?
oh well it ' s good they ' re still around .
oh , sorry to hear this . you just want to make it up clean soon
you have to find the person who did this . then you should made the mess to clean it up
i agree , man . almost nothing feels as good as financial security .
but good lo ##vin ' can be a bill . . if you know what i mean .
what do you do to get prepared ?
sounds like somebody ' s thinking ahead ! do you listen to a lot of alex jones
maybe you could try aa meetings or suggest to your wife that she can go to al an ##on meetings . it ' s a good first start .
it worked for me and my husband . we were going through the same type of thing for about a year .
talk to him wise ##ly
oh i mean talk to him in the way that he will understand . with love so that he reasons with you
i would be too ! have you had time to prepare ?
that ' s good . i ' m sure you will do good !
ah , i have so many fond memories of playing ball in the yard with my dad !
that ' s fantastic : ) nostalgia is an amazing thing
that ' s amazing ! i bet he was el ##ated .
you ' ll have to cong ##rat ##ulate him for me . what a great accomplishment .
you must be so happy ? what was the job you got a interview for ?
is the nanny job close to where you live ?
thing very carr ##ef ##ull ##y before making this important decision .
she is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family .
you must be taking good care of her in and out if you know what i mean
i hope you can make her realize how grateful you are by being faithful
oh me neither ! i don ' t like a cheat ##er !
seems simple , but nobody does it that way it seems like .
oh yeah ? what song is it ?
oh man , just saying that name brings back nostalgia for me !
that is great , but i take she is not alive anymore ? ?
well , she is in a better place for sure .
i would have to agree with you there . i don ' t trust him at all !
i agree . i can ' t understand how his supporters don ' t see it ! i guess they don ' t want to see it !
you ' ll be fine . it will be a great learning experience .
i agree , but the journey makes it worth it . you ' ll meet new people and have new experiences .
that ' s awesome . do you go kay ##aking often ?
do you own your own kay ##ak or do you rent ?
i want to get a sea kay ##ak ( i like to fish )
its also a lot cheaper than a boat and you can get into the shallow salt flats easy .
that ' s very irritating ! is it difficult to change the headlights in your truck ?
yeah that shouldn ' t happen . i hate changing the headlights on my car . they made it really tough to get to .
i can see the appeal . i have the opposite situation . tiny sub - compact , but goes a long time on a tank .
seems incredible but also kind of boring at the same time .
was anyone else there watching him too ?
what did your son do that makes you so happy ?
that ' s great ! i ' m sure that you are a very proud parent !
good for you . it looks he is making an effort .
he just proved he loves you a lot .
why are you anxious about the co ##un ##ry ?
i think we ' ll be fine . pe ##ope ##l talk a lot about a trade war but , leave out the fact that places like the eu already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs . how can they call us raising our tariffs a trade war if they ' re still lower than what they bill us ?
cong ##rat ##s . i bet they were very impress with you .
i bet they will never challenge you again .
yes , it feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards .
no , never barefoot . i hope you took a long shower . smelling like dog po ##o won ##t get you any ladies .
that would be tough . have you found a support group to go too ?
that would be difficult ! i can ' t imagine the pain you must be going through . sounds like ya ' ll have good memories together .
that sounds like a great gan ##dm ##a ! you are so blessed to have those memories with her !
my mom thinks that her grandma ' s spirit is in me , because she died right before i was born .
i ' m sorry , interviews can be rough . was there a part of the interview day that you found especially difficult ?
maybe it went better than you thought ! if not , you still gained some experience from the day .
really ?
pets are good as they keep company
oh my god , it ' s like a most heart ##broken moment of me
because in that moment is a gift and the last end of hope
i ' m not quite sure what you are telling me , but handling work and school is certainly hard
i suppose . training the next generation is important
what ##s wrong ? did anything happen ? have you reached out to any friends lately ?
aw man , im sorry . that sounds rough . i know how you feel . time usually helps but it ' s pretty gradual . hang in there .
can we use the " broken " to describe our political system ?
i agree , the political system we have is a mess and i think it will get worse .
wow congratulations ! is this your first ?
wow i ' m sure you ' ll be a great parent ! best of luck !
my boyfriend had issues with his foot , he ' s even had a few hospital stays for it .
his was too . he had an ul ##cer that got very infected . lost half his pink ##y toe .
i feel you . i had the same feeling when i first left my child on day - care
you are gonna have to let go one day . it ' s gonna be hard
i ' m sorry to hear that , is there something in particular that ' s bothering you the most ?
i agree that tensions are higher than ever ! hopefully our country will get on the right track soon , i ' m looking forward to voting in the primaries .
oh no ! why are you mad at them ?
that stink ##s ! try not to be jealous though . something else will come your way .
i bet it was . it looks like you had a panic attack .
you probably need to do some kind of therapy to su ##pres these panic attacks .
that is horrible ! have you ever said anything to him about it ?
maybe you should mention that you just want a " guy ' s night " and he would get the hint ?
that sucks . well on the bright side at least you had a suit . hopefully you were just a regular attend ##ee .
yeah , i know how that is . i bet you won ' t forget it next time after having to endure all that .
oh no ! you should have pre ##ord ##ered it online !
what book was it ?
oh no ! you must be quite upset about that . i am sorry to hear that .
wow , that is very unfortunate . maybe a camera nearby was able to see them .
that is very upset ##ting . everything will be okay though .
i have not seen a snake in the woods , have you ? that sounds frightening !
what did you do ?
holy smoke ##s !
oh i hate when that happens . i ' m sorry you felt that way . did you not buy the dress ?
that ' s good though . i ' m glad you were able to find something .
oh man . tha must have been so em ##bara ##ssing .
you could not read the room ? ? someone was probably laughing at you .
first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear
i think you have to go for a check up first before you can conclude . it might be a harmless mole
oh wow ! that must have been frightening ! that sounds like an exciting experience , though .
no kidding ! that will be a memory that you will be unlikely to forget !
that is something to be excited about . how far away are you moving ?
sounds like a nice upgrade . do you think you ' ll miss your old house at all ?
it ' s okay . people are very understanding . did you under ##pa ##y ? i ' m sure it happens all the time !
we all have those moments ! sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath .
i did . i once won $ 10 , 000 from col ##gate tooth ##pas ##te .
i do use their tooth ##pas ##te , but it was just an instant win contest online . it was years ago . have you ever won a cash prize ?
wow ! that ' s amazing !
i ' m sorry to hear you were feeling that way .
what types of encouragement was your friend saying to you ?
that ' s a cool toy you got for your nephew
that will help him al ##ot
yeah that ' s true
that ' s not so bad . everyone cheat ##s on their diet from time to time . i would just pick up where you left off .
well that ' s all the more reason that you shouldn ' t worry about it ! you deserved to have a day off after that long !
oh how exciting , you must be proud !
yeah , my husband got a thank you like that at work recently and it made us so happy too . congratulations !
did you end up taking him ?
is he just naturally un ##ru ##ly or does he have some sort of condition ?
i ' m aware of the " terrible two ' s " i ' ve never heard of the three ##nage ##r but , im not surprised to hear of it
oh man ! i love pokemon ! the first one i ever played was pokemon blue .
those were the good ol ' days . now they have way too many pokemon . i miss the original 151 .
that ' s awesome to hear ! your hard work has paid off .
you should buy yourself a nice treat once you get the promotion !
good luck . i bet you are ready for this exam .
i am sure you are going to be a su ##cc ##es ##ful ##l professional
that sucks . maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied while he ' s gone ?
that ' s understand ##able . i ' d probably feel the same way in the same situation .
oh that ' s awful ! i invested 6 , 000 in january and i ' m down to $ 150 now . i sold off a lot to pay bills but if i wait for it to go back up i can maybe recover 1 , 500 .
i know , i am confident it will go back so i ' m hanging on to this last bit . good luck !
so you guys probably don ' t get along very well ?
does the wife hate you ?
i don ' t , are you waiting for one ?
nice , i hope you get a nice bonus check !
oh that sounds like fun if you are an outdoor person . are you excited ?
well that is good , how many people are you going with ?
cong ##rat ##s . i bet you worked hard for tha raised .
you deserve this raise and many more in the future .
aw , that ' s nice ! i haven ' t considered that yet as i ' m still quite young
i hope so one day ! it ' s a goal of mine : )
wow , that is scary . did you guys do anything or just stay away from it ?
yes , i ' d be very concerned about pets , too . i ' m glad your fiance got it before it caused anyone anymore trouble .
oh no ! what happened ? i can ' t imagine having to go through something that scary .
holy mo ##ly ! i am so glad you are okay . i ' m sure that gave you quite a fright .
i love going to the casino ! my favorite game of all time is black ##jack . what are you thinking about playing ?
it ' s swell to meet another player of the craft . do you rake in the big bucks playing hold ' em ?
oh man . . . that would tick me off . what did you do ?
i probably would not chop his tree down . you want to have the moral high ground . but yes i would confront him
sounds exciting ! are you going anywhere exotic ?
nice ! i visited spain not too long ago . i am positive you will have a blast .
oh that ' s fun ! i love to play video games , but it ' s usually with friends .
anything from mario party to god of war . it ' s always fun with friends around for commentary lo ##l
what ' s your orientation ?
i see , there are some jerk ##s out there in this world .
oh my , hope u are alright now . it must have been a terrible experience
good that you finally took control of the situation
what is the subject ? ? the test will be oral or in writing .
if you are prepared , then you will do fine .
do you think they are messing up the country ?
yeah they feed off of his crazy i think .
that ' s awesome . how long have you been together ?
congratulations to both her and you ! i ' m sure she ' ll keep doing well in her new role .
that happens sometimes . was it mistaken for something that might have been sitting there forever ?
i ' m sure if you explain it to them , and maybe treat them to lunch another day , they ' ll forgive you , if they haven ' t already .
i ' m kinda the same way . although , i feel like if my friends truly care about me , they ' ll find out and remember my birthday on their own . no need to go b ##lab ##bing to everyone about it .
now why would they go and do that ! well , in any case , what did good ole ron get for you ?
ya ##y ! that is a difficult feat .
mine took months to train forever . i was so happy when he finally learned .
have you tried taking any as ##pi ##rin ? i feel bad for you , my friend .
yeah , sometimes you have to do that to get better . i would take another dose if i were you .
do you have any plans for it ? that sounds exciting !
i would kill for two weeks of r & r , good for you !
that ' s wonderful . there ' s nothing like a bit of retail therapy to cheer you up . now you
sure does . i hope you continue to enjoy your new dress - you make me want to go and buy one now !
oh , i will and i know just where i ' ll wear it - there ' s a new restaurant just opened i want to try out .
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that . is she feeling any better ?
that must have been unpleasant for her . i am glad to hear that she is feeling better ,
i know the an ##ci ##pta ##tion of giving big presentations . are you nervous ?
i would tell you to think of everyone in their underwear , but i am pretty sure that advice never works !
holy mo ##ly , that ' s some rough luck . did you find the guy who did it ?
dan ##g dude . is your insurance company covering it at least ?
i am so glad to hear that . what is the secret ?
how did you meet her ? was it through an online dating service ?
get to studying ! i ' m sure if you get in a few more ##s hours you will feel more confident !
hard work always pays off !
i have been there , my friend . but , the good news is , if you aren ' t typically late for your bills , the utilities companies will often cut you a break .
i am positive ! i have been late before for the very same reason . don ' t even need to make phone calls - they just give you a small late fee and that ' s it . i wouldn ' t go making it a habit , though .
how did that happen ? i would be so upset .
did starbucks not make you a new one ? i am definitely gr ##ump ##y if i don ' t get my morning coffee !
oh well it ' s still fun that you got to participate in that .
ha ##ha that ' s really a cute story though .
oh wow , did anything end up happening to you ? did you get 20 years in prison ?
eh , i suppose worse things could happen . was it worth it ?
great ! what kind of business ?
music therapy sounds very interesting .
that is great . do you remember what words he had to spell ?
that is a pretty tough word . i am happy your son did so great . you must have been beaming .
that ' s a down ##er , man . who do you think was the per ##pet ##rator ?
that really sucks man . did he ever apologize to you and give the money back ?
oh no ! did he not study ?
he will for sure get it next time . i ' m sure you scared him enough ha ##ha
i love flying ! was it your first time on an airplane ?
i prefer night flying as well . i love how you can see the city lights moving , like it ' s the life ##blood of a living thing .
sometimes destiny has strange ways of manifest ##ing itself .
try to conquer your wife again , it ' s never too late for a second chance , the love of our lives makes it worth the effort .
i do as well ! what do you miss most ?
there ' s really nothing like college parties . those were the days .
you should con ##fi ##sca ##te his video game and teach him a lesson .
you are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline .
oh no ! any particular reason why ?
that ' s horrible ! but , it could be many other things instead . i hope you go to the doctor
how did it go . did you have fun ?
why is that ? you don ' t now how to dance ?
oh no . how did you pay ?

oh wow , that is so sad . have you contacted an attorney ?
what ha ##ha that ' s a real thing ? ? ?

oh gee ##z , that sounds pretty embarrassing . did any of the bottles break ?
that ' s a shame . if they did , you could ' ve reversed the situation and summoned everybody over to throw down and have a su ##pre ##mo wine fest .
you should feel bad for just cursing at a lady .

that must be a great feeling ! good for you ! you should be proud that things are going well and not take it for granted .
good deal ! i am happy to help !
yes , i am as well . do you have any investments that could be affected ?
i understand that , but do you have a personal investment portfolio that will be directly affected ?

aw ##w , did you find a lot ?
i love finding old videos too !

completely frustrating . i usually end up calling customer service and complaining until it ' s fixed if it happens repeatedly .
did your daughter ' s team win ?
lo ##l , that must have been a very proud moment for you as a parent
oh no that is terrible . are you guys still talking now ?

i would be scared too , but i ' m happy it turned out well .
that is the best feeling .
oh no , that is too bad . i am sorry for your un ##nee ##ded expenditures .
that is a good attitude to have . i am proud of your maturity .

dad ##s are the best , what would we do without them ?
wow how amazing ! you must be so excited .
wow enjoy it , you deserve it !
om ##g , you should have killed it
i think you should fu ##mi ##gate your home
have you been able to get over your fear ?
that is good to hear . you might consider joining some groups . toast ##masters might be a good one to look into .
was your aunt nice to you ?
sometimes it is difficult to talk to relatives . take a deep breath and treat her like a long time friend .
oh no , i hate when that happens . people always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a stands ##till as well . how long did you have to wait ?
adding time to your com ##mute from work to home is the worst . i mean you ' ve put in a full day , you just want to get home !
so , the pup is healthy and situated now ?
i ' m sorry to hear that rip dogg ##o . i have a rescue that ' s middle aged now .
how exciting ! has it been a long time since you ' ve seen her ?
i ' m jealous ! that ' s so sweet and i hope you have a great time !
oh no ! what did you do ?
how about a ho ##bble down the isle ? i ' m sure it will still be just as beautiful walking down the isle or not .
that would be difficult , so glad you survived .
hopefully you have a strong family support .
maybe it was best to avoid drama at work
not getting your cow ##or ##ker in trouble and causing a conflict
has your boyfriend ever cheated on you ?
i agree . trust is the basis for any good relationship .
how did that go ?
the cigarette break is not a good sign at all .
this is so good , well done
how long have you been on this ?
i think there are a lot more choices now than there was years ago
i still remember the old tube tv ##s
that is nice . where are you going ?
that is a good idea .
i am sure he will !
no , no reason to he will do it .
that ' s awesome . good parenting pays off .
always a plus . that makes things easier

i ' d be that excited too , i love to fish .

the downward spiral is ne ##ve ##er please ##nt to see .

oh no ! a lot of kids that age seem to do that with cars they get , yet parents keep buying them new .
oh no , why is that ?
what instruments do your daughters play ?
hi friend , how are you ?
not yet , i think you should talk to me about it .
to feel joy is the maximum , whatever the cause , i think it is a beautiful emotion .
feel joy and feel peace , are the best combination of emotions to be happy in life .

good point . any example to share ?
oh wow , i am so sorry to hear that . may i ask what happened ?
oh , well i ' m sure she was worried , but di ##so ##wn ##ing you doesn ' t help ! and now she won ' t know your child . that ' s very sad .
i ' m sure it was hard but worth it !
that ' s great i hope you get it !
i bet that was an awkward conversation . did you feel em ##bara ##ssed ?
well that is good she prepared you , most parents just avoid the topic .
i ' ve heard it ' s quite dangerous , are you scared ?
i bet it ' s going to be hard to fit in culturally , are you religious ?
ye ##a something ##s are just worth trying to see how they ' d go . you made it through well ##don ##e
yes teachers do al ##ot and they deserve credit
wow that ' s so fun , you ' re lucky to have many people who care about you .
i hope you had fun .

oh my go ##sh , how horrible ! i hope she will be okay .
you are a nice friend , she ' s lucky to have you .
dan ##g . that is annoying
you must have informed them ab ##ou this
i bet that was really cool ! did you play with them for a little ? you ' re never to old to play with toys
that ##s awesome ! old toys are the best toys
that ' s great . how long have you been apart for ?
do you have some fun activities planned ?
oh wow ! i ' ve always wanted to do that . you ' re quite brave
it ' s good to have someone with you who knows what they ' re doing , though . that certainly helps !
that is awesome ! why were you nervous ?
i am so happy everything went well for you .
wow . that is a sight to wake up to . what did you do ?
i can imagine . i would be burning that sheet set
oh my god ! did it try to bite you ?
that must have been a shock . i hope you took it outside after that .

fantastic . congratulations !
i bet you ' re so happy ! i would be !

om ##g i am so sorry to hear that . : ( are you feeling at peace at all now ?
that is a long time so i am sure its been very hard . im really sorry but i hope soon you can find peace .
that ' s terrible and frustrating because you can ' t really do anything about it .
ha ##ha , best to find another job first . at least employment is looking pretty good these days .
oh man , that sounds awful . i thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful .
that ' s rough . i feel for you ! but , as you said it ' s over so life goes on : }
that ' s pretty amazing . i have tried jug ##gling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible .
i can understand that . after my failed attempt , my oldest son , then 13 , came in the room jug ##gling successfully a few minutes later . he watched a youtube video and learned in about 15 minutes . . .
i ' m sorry to hear that . what do they get treatment for ?
i ' m sure that ' s really tough . i hope he appreciate ##s all that you ' re doing for him , and i ' m sure it ' ll work out : )
that ' s nice , must have saved you a lot of time .
it ' s election day here , that may be the cause of it .
i wish i got that many days off . the good old days of childhood .
wait until summer comes , you ' ll be ready for them to go back to school after a month .
oh i love perfume , what ##s it smell like ?

it ' s always good to see family ! what concert was it ?
oh cool ! what kind of music does he play ?
i am so happy for you and the dog
i am sure she will be okay
have you asked the teacher for any sort of help ?
i think you should try to find different ways to go about the problem . i ' m not great at math either but i think you could find some online forums willing to help you .
are spending too much on unnecessary things ?
do you have any concrete financial plan on full repay ##ment of your debts ?
cong ##rat ##s to your father ! at what age did he get to finally relax ! ?
good for him ! he sounds like an awesome guy .
that is nice . are you excited
it should be a easy process
oh great ! is it a college and what are you studying ?
oh man ! i bet you are ! just remember to be confident in yourself and you ' ll do fine ! don ' t let trolls to you either
oh i know how that feels . you can start over tomorrow though .
i hate those craving ##s . i need to start doing better too .
that ' s awesome ! i love swimming . are you going to the pool or the beach ?
i love going to the pool . i hope you have a great time !
oh no . i really dislike the ##ives .
do you have insurance ?
you should think about that for all of your stuff got situations like this .
leaving you ? why ?
ok now i understand
we are too hard on ourselves ! we really shouldn ##t care what others think but i would have felt the same
im the same ! give people a look when they look at you maybe some crazy eyes ! lo ##l
oh gee ##z ! that would suck ! i hope it wasn ' t a cold day ? could you drive home and get new clothes ?
oh i have numb ##ness in my hands so i am always spilling things so don ' t feel too bad ! i understand though . as you can see - i don ' t like having stuff on my clothes either lo ##l
wow ! how old is he ?
amazing ! congratulations . when so many children have issues , it is always great to see one that is healthy and well .
that sounds awful . mine used to have a bad group of friends too at one point so i know how it feels . sometimes you just want to yell " grow up ! ! ! "
yes ! ! ! i cannot even express to you how much i agree ! ! my mom used to say " you are who you hang out with " and its one of the most true things i have ever been told by anyone ! !
that ' s awful . it sounds like a freak accident . what happen ##d ?
wow , i am sorry to hear . i had a friend with an an ##eur ##ys ##m pass suddenly about 2 years ago . it was hard and i can ' t imagine how you feel with it being your father .
why were you nervous
i do love a good sour
i can imagine she and the school appreciate that
that was a very nice gesture
how did it go ?
we all get nervous about changing our surroundings
i have seen them
i am not sure i believe them most of the time though
wow . that ' s pretty cool .
i would have been too . no one has ever bought me a car .
i am sorry , how old was it
that is a lot of memories
what was your excuse ?
wow , that is pretty bad . at least it was a cousin and not a sibling .
sounds like he ' s getting the hang of it , that ' s good .
maybe i should of did the same for mines , to late now .
thank you , i ' ll do that .
yes i do . do you ?
is that a good or a bad thing ?
sticky paper is so gross . have you every used cl ##ove ##s ? you can put the in your windows to keep flies out .
i don ' r know . once i found out about cl ##ove ##s that worked fr me . maybe you should het an ex ##ter ##mina ##tor although that seems extreme .
pro ##ba ##bl ##t . im sorry i couldn ##t help you .
okay , how come ?
that sounds great ! i should look in too them more .
that ##s pretty awesome ! college or highs ##cho ##ol test ##t ?
nice ! science is fun but for some reason the tests can be very hard !
i am sure no one noticed
i do get that way too sometimes
so you did get it ?
well good for you . is it everything you wanted > i once had a job turn out to be the worst .
i do not yet
i bet that was scary at the time
new people make me so nervous .
i have never tried one of those . did it help ?
well that ' s pretty cool . you should own the joint by now .
oh yeah ? i bet that was exciting for both of you . open house at their school ?
i had an experience similar to that as well . their teachers look like they should still be in high school . but , they are so eager to do well i get excited with my kids for the school year .
def ##ina ##tly . i would not want to do that job , with such alf ##ul pay unless i loved the work . wouldn ' t be fair to anyone involved .
i love going to the th ##rift stores as well ! what did you by
tell me about it ! ! i bought so many brand new shirts in a th ##rift store last year and they still look awesome because the quality was so great
having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones . it is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it ! so don ' t feel bad
i understand ! i used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma i am very anxious as well and i don ' t care to have people i don ' t trust around me any ##how . maybe try meet ##ups or forums where people have the same interests ?
what does he do that scares you ?
he may just be on a different time schedule than you . my neighbor does something similar , he mo ##ws his lawn at 3a ##m
that ' s kind of odd . is he old ?
wow . that must be nice .
good for you ! i have never gotten a promotion before .
most of them are like that , or they are fix ##ated by what everything costs .
yes , but isn ' t innocence a beautiful thing .
me too . i hope you have nice memories .
well that ##s good . some people aren ' t so lucky
oh no ! what did you do ?
that ' s not good : ( i hope you don ' t drive under influence anymore , you could ' ve gotten into an accident
oh , that sound alf ##ul ! some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share .
it is sad . es ##pic ##ally since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the en ##vir ##ome ##nt better for everyone .
oh ! i love the sound of rain , i could just sit in the warm rain too !
it does just bring about a great feeling doesn ' t it ?
oh thank goodness ! if i may ask , what was he in the hospital for ?
was it anything serious ? so many things can go wrong with out bodies !
i hate when people do that
i am not sure , that is a good question
what did they want ?
well , it was fortunate that you got it back ok .
did something bad happen ?
that is true . it is sad .
i ' ve heard of that , is it any good ?
i ' ve found a lot of bbc shows are really good because they don ' t try to drag them out really far .
wow that is crazy , sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area , sadly !
yes it is very disgusting , i just don ' t understand why it takes some people so long to get their act together !
death can happen in an instant ! i have been there the past year . i am sorry !
me too ! so sorry ! life doesn ' t get any easier . it ' s just about trying to enjoy every day
its always worth a shot
my mom was bipolar
what did he do ?
well that happens sometimes .
i do hate storms , they can be scary
i am glad you are okay though
that is exciting ! so it will be the first real year of school for you and them ?
i forgot all about pre ##k , you can see mine aren ##t old enough yet . lo ##l well i am happy for you that ##s very exciting .
oh , that is exciting . what did you do with them ?
that ' s a great idea . such a good way to preserve a memory .
wow that ##s amazing ! how old are they and what do they play ?
oh ! two of the most beautiful instruments ! cong ##rat ##s ! does musical ability run in your family ?
awesome ! what do you hope for their future ?
what do you think that you ' ll have ?
i ' m glad you seem to have it all figured out .
oh gee ##z . that is common with kids . not the fun ##nes ##t times . do you carry extra clothes too ?
oh yes ! always carry an extra ones ##ie and pants . that has saved me many times !
how old is your gram ##ma ? old people can get gr ##ump ##y
i hope it all works out for your mom
what happened to it
that doesn ##t sound so hard to fix
what was his excuse ?
ou ##ch that ' s pretty bad . did he apologize ?
that ' s very vague , did you like the shows ? or the program itself ?
that ' s so cool ! i liked the shows on that channel as well .
doesn ' t that cost a lot ?
they do always have snacks .
oh ! do you feel scared at all and will miss her ?
do they have cameras there so you can watch her during the day ?
i will look into that thank you so much that ##s kind of you ! any special diet or fitness online you are following ? i know you can do this .
i recently read about fast ##ing myself ! i tried it for a whole few days and of course stopped . i wish i had your determination ! i wish you a lot of luck . : )
i have a few friends doing ke ##to and you seem to really like it so i am going to give it a go ! ill try your advice . thank you !
aw poor kitty ! well that is their fault for sure . have you spoke to them about it ? also you can get these spray things that keep cast out of your yard - they spray them with water when they cross a barrier -
oh man ! well some owners suck ! i would definitely look in to the water spray ##ers . is the cat fixed ?
you should make it a weekend project
you will get it done i believe in you
that is so beautiful ! are you going to do it every year now and make it tradition ?
right ! that ##s what i am thinking too . . . so cool when communities come together like that .
wow , haven ' t people heard of knocking once and waiting ? that sounds wo ##rri ##some .
was he a salesman ?
so you got a lemon ? check your state laws
things like this happen all the time
oh man ! i so understand that ! did you have to eat ram ##en and $ 1 meals ? i did ! it was awful ! i am so glad you are in a better place now
oh yes , i have been there to ! some food pan ##tries are amazing but some have just crap ##py sugar ##y foods .
what did he do ?
oh neighborhood , lo ##l i thought it said neighbor for a second ! why wasn ##t it safe ?
ty ##po ##s happen to the best of us right ! im glad the summer was at ##lea ##st nice for them and that the bad people left !
i ' ll be the judge of that
that ' s nothing . as long as you still get her a phone . i wouldn ##t be mad
well give her the new phone and then you get one later . happy wife happy life
oh i hear you ! it '
sorry ! it ' s so nice when you can afford nice stuff ! i feel you there . i do not have a tv - i watch everything on the computer lo ##l ! as i am on it all the time
how long was it out for
i hear you
that ' s very kind of you . did she feel better after ?
that ' s good to hear . do parents often view the day ##care cameras ?
oh man ! i am so sorry ! you must be devastated .
oh man . . i just had someone go through that . it is ho ##rri ##fying . yes a long battle can be good or bad . i am sorry .
i bet that was a nice surprise
that is always a nice surprise
what does the teacher say happened ?
oh , that ' s rough .
sometimes depending on who they are .
that ' s so nice . im happy for you .
are you gonna see each other again soon ?
a hurricane ?
we have a hurricane kit / emergency essential kit always .
they are good to have . always to be prepared .
a good phone is something everyone must have
you ' re the first person i know that has an xp ##eria
i feel the same ! i hate apple products . i refuse to use them
i didn ' t know that . another reason to not like them
i am sure you will do great . what kind of biology is it ?
you just need to know that the mit ##och ##ond ##ria is the powerhouse .
yeah i could never do bio it was too much memo ##rization . i like physics more which is why i ' m in engineering .
what type of math is it ?
oh my god ! that is so sad ! i am so sorry !
that is a good way of looking at things .
some people are just so careless . . . i am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child . shame on the parent tho .
i know its a pain in the rear to lu ##g them around but you have to . i lu ##g mine around like a kangaroo with her kid in her pouch .
that ' s the worst . . expectations can make and break us . i hope the next time around you get it !
that is a good outlook to have
that is a great . i hope it was a good offer
oh that sounds convenient
that is so true .
i am thankful for every day i get to spend with my children .
that makes me sad too . i wish there was more i could do to help out .
that ' s a good idea !
it feels good when your on top of things .
well , i ' m sure they will benefit greatly from all the preparation . they should be proud to have a mom who cares as much as you .
oh that ##s wonderful ! how long have your parents been together ?
oh gee ##z , lo ##l . do you not like to cook ? cong ##rat ##ulate your parents for me . it ' s great to find someone you love and then also to have it last so long !
i ' ve seen that before . it is sad .
i do too . everyone deserves to have someone in their corner .
oh that ' s a bum ##mer ! do you go to college locally ?
oh great ! i am not a big fan of college anyway . maybe you will find a new love while they are away : )
i don ' t think anything is worse than dealing with a period as a teenager !
i miss being so care ##free and having the whole world at my fingertips !
awesome ! history is hard ! i always had a hard time remembering the dates and times especially .
amazing ! what was your final grade ?
its nice that you care so much about them
they are that
that ' s unfortunate . how many animals did you have ?
what kind of animals were they ?
u ##gh . . for the better or worst ? how are you feeling ?
if you are feeling that way then it probably is ! on to a fresh start .
me either . it is going to be interesting .
two daughters and one son
hope you ' ve got a lot of storage room . we try to do that too .
how old are they ?
wow , mothers have the best instincts when it comes to their children .
exactly , take care of her . she is a treasure .
you ' re very lucky ! a lot of people can ' t say that these days .
i wish i could do that .
that is so sad ! i would be so mad at the drunk driver ! how could he live with himself !
i agree ! there is no excuse for that to have happened ! such a tragedy !
why did they do that ?
oh shoot . did you forget to pay ?
i am sure that was embarrassing . just a mistake .
that ' s pretty cool . did they win any games in the tournament ?
well that ' s amazing !
who did they win it over ?
that is awesome !
did you pass ?
that is great , good job .
that is disappointing . what will you do now ?
i don ' t blame you .
that is great . she will have fun participating in spelling bees
that is outstanding !
what scared you
oh man how did you get it out
that ' s wonderful . i feel the same about my daughters .
10 and 13 now , but it never changes .
that sucks . i hope you had insurance .
well he was the one that caused it , so that ' s what he gets .
what happened ?
i ' m sorry , you must miss them a lot if you don ' t see them as much as you used to .
he is a jerk .
don ' t forgive him or your friend . find new people
why have you wanted every career instead of focusing on just one ?
i think you could still find one if you wanted too .
that sucks . have you investigated her
sucks , i ' ve had to work under sc ##umb ##ag mana ##gm ##ent before
that ##s awesome ! what have you been doing to reach it ?
u ##gh sounds like work . . . . . . but you did it !
i ' m 50 and haven ' t rode one since i was 2 .
don ' t have anywhere i need to go .
i can relate to that .
that will be nice . having a side gig really helps a lot as long as it doesn ##t take too much time
nice ! what was it for ?
awesome ! what do you do at your job ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
i ' m sure you will be vin ##dicated .
who ##ops , lots of people have done that . what ' d she say ?
hopefully you were able to work it out . . . if not . . . in the future don ' t tell girlfriends about ex ##es .
and did you ?
great job !
that does sound awful ! the thought of being out in the middle of the ocean makes me nervous
i agree . don ' t let it stop from taking a nice get ##away though
that sounds really annoying ! you should confront him and request he stop .
that would make me really angry . call a tow truck to teach him a lesson .
why didn ##t you want to not ##ify or leave some sort of little note on the car ?
happens sometimes just don ##t know what to do in those moments .
that seems like it ' d be strange .
well , you could always have left .
do they play any instruments ?
that ' s cool , can they sing too ?
i hate when that happens , did you have to put all your stuff back ?
well it happens to everyone at least once probably , so no worries .
happens all the time in the city i live in , people are rude !
yu ##p ! no reason to st ##oop to their level . you did right
i hope you didn ' t use any .
was the soup good at least ?
what did you say ?
what did you do instead ?
that would freak me out . what was it form ?
oh wow ! did he get caught ?
what were you on edge about ?
what movie did she see ?
sorry to hear that . what ' s wrong ?
i know that feeling , it will get better . just gotta stay positive
ha , that sounds comical .
you could just think that maybe you were alone .
that was pretty crap ##py . what did you do instead .
that ' s really crap ##py . you ' re rack ##ing up the bad karma .
that ' s got to be frustrating for you .
have you tried asking for a raise yourself ?
i have felt that way sometimes too

did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it ! ?
im sure ! ! ! i had a ge ##cko come in my house today and it was adorable yet i was still super scared to touch it .

yi ##kes , i hope you have insurance .
don ' t worry man , you ' ll be fine . everyone makes mistakes
that ##s good everything is so close . it really helps out a lot and walking is good for you !

it ' s hard to admit when we are wrong . do you think you will fe ##ss up ?
i understand that
i believe in you ! where are you planning on going ?
i was thinking a cruise sounds perfect for you and your kids !

i ' m sorry , sometimes people , even family can be difficult . you can ' t be all things to all people . give yourself a break on this .
you guys sound like a strong family !
sorry to hear that , maybe one day you entire family can get along
i feel the same way . i don ' t trust people are paying attention
that is my biggest fear too

what happened ?
whoa , that sucks . you need to get away from them asa ##p .
i ' ve only been to a couple of minor lea ##gur ##e games in the city .

i have never had any . is it similar to eating cr ##aw ##fish ?
sometimes you just have to ind ##ul ##ge and then do better next time .

you will be so shocked at how well it works i promise . you don ' t want to go over .

i did the sa ##e thing this year i took my daughter to see my favorite band . who was the singer ?
we saw inc ##ub ##us . she had a good time .

i am also , i love football .
i only watch football on sundays .
prom sounds exciting . do you have a date ?
nice ! that sounds so fun . are you taking her to dinner first ?
music can do that to you sometimes . i listen to mine regularly .
i would agree with that 100 %
i know right . if you invade my personal space , prepare for backlash .
i hate that so much , people need to learn manners .
oh my go ##sh ! i would be mort ##ified ! did your face turn red ?
wow ! that had to be so embarrassing ! i would probably quit my job !
what all do you have stored so far ?
do you also have a go - bag ?
yes , i do not like that either .

bum ##mer . i enjoyed summer so much .
but at least christmas is around the corner . i love christmas just as much as the summer !

50 , yeah , but it ' s just not the same .
that sounds fun . what kind ?
those are really cool looking
that must have been nerve - wr ##ack ##ing ?
sounds like you have a very responsible young lady growing up .
me too , i feel you bro . it ' s ok at least make sure you are being productive .
try joining clubs or finding ho ##bbies ? or you can always make friends on online video games !
sounds gross lo ##l
om ##g . you should take your dog to an obedience school .
those are always so much fun . catching up with old friends .

that is great ! i bet it feels good .
it sure is and it gives you something to be proud of .

that sounds cool !
that ' s amazing . i have only been on a few planes in my life .
i have not and will not ever .

that is something i need too . how did they get new so cheap ?
that sounds awesome
it is very important to stay close to family .
that is wonderful to hear . when times are tough , family is all you have in this world .

that ' s really bad . what is she going to do about it >
have you eaten it all yet ?
well , you ' ve done well so far then .
what happened ?
i would have pee ##d my pants .
i am sure you are good at many other things though .
that ’ s ok . if you would like to learn start simple
i ' m sorry for your loss . that sa to hear .
it must be really tough . it will get better .
oh ye ##a ? what was the bet ?
everyone ' s got that low minimum wage job at one point in their life sometimes .
take a power nap .
they really do rec ##har ##ger you .
that ’ s no good . how did she do that ?
that explains it !
did everything go okay ?
your friend probably understands if you couldn ##t make it .
lo ##l c ' mon man , show some class .
i understand , sometimes you just gotta " let a bomb drop " .
did it escape your house ?
have you put out signs ? contacted the animal shelter ?
sm ##ores are a must when camping .
i don ' t know . they probably brought their cell phones
i have never been so lucky .
i ' ve found a couple of dollars and lighter ##s in the washing machine . that ##s about it lo ##l
allergic to onions ? i have never heard of anyone with that all ##ergy . must be tough
i hate onions , i just don ' t like the texture of them

well he sure did save a lot in labor costs .
hoping the beta was okay .
oh wow . a fish freezing in the sun ? or was it winter and sunny ?

that would be nice , but it ' s highly unlikely .
it sure was .
that sounds familiar . is there someone she can get it from ?
that ’ s a relief .
what did you yell at her for ?
oh , that is sad , i hope she knows mistakes happen !
mario is such a classic . haven ' t played smash since game ##cu ##be i think .

i have never tried and never will lo ##l
that ' s what i think . plus i ' d miss bacon too much .
you must be his role model ! that ' s awesome .
that ' s just funny ! well i ' m glad to hear she ' s learning and improving ! good to start them young .
what ' s inside ?
why did she send you a shipment anyway ##s ?
appreciate them while they are with you and try not to worry .
it ' s unfortunately . if only we can all go together and not leave anyone behind .
well you seem to have done a great job parenting !
that is awesome , that is hard to come by
do you guys still spend the holidays together ?
oh no . i ' m sorry to hear that .
oh no ! is what you have in there worth more than 500 ?
i know but if there is nothing valuable in there just forget about it .
i hate bullying . you should talk to the ki ##ids parents .
beat the kids up . that ' s what i would do .
for college ?
there ' s still another month of summer left where i am .
i feel the same way . everyone isn ' t as fortunate to have family .
i learned a long time ago how important family is and now i have my own .
exactly
what show is that ?
i did not know it was ending , sorry to hear that !
what are your goals ?
ah i see . it ' s always nice to have a goal to work towards .

that ' s a lot to take in .
oh . how was it different to the previous ones ?
ye ##a . didn ' t warrant a new version , hu ?
i am sorry to hear that , why are you working extra ?
ah , i know that all too well , best of luck

i ' m not a big fan of spin ##ach myself .
wow . i have been trying . how did you do it ?
that ' s great . i ' ll get there one day . i wanna see my great grand ##ki ##ds

i ' ll need to keep a look out for it !
that is terrible , i hope you feel better !
yeah , i hope so !
what dog breed is it ?
oh wow , that is an energetic dog , good luck !
it sucks , but sometimes you just can ' t compare yourself to other people .
ye ##a , i get you . it ' s hard not to feel bad when someone seems to have it easier .
that ' s tough , it ' s good he has a friend like you to help him out though .
it ' s good you have a close friend to count on too if needed .
that ' s good to have reliable friends .
how many years now ?
i think a lot of us have been afraid of the dark .
i ' m glad you ' re not afraid of it anymore though !
where are you going ?
ah , that should be fun , probably nice this time of year !
why aren ' t you anymore ?
what were you most afraid of at night ?
that is amazing ! i ' m happy to hear that . i can relate , i feel like i have und ##ia ##gno ##sed add .
i have a very hard time focusing on what i ' m reading , so it can definitely slow down the learning process .
i can relate to that ! it ' s so mort ##ifying because everyone begins to look at you like you ' re a bad parent !
that ' s usually the main cu ##lp ##rit of those situations !
i ' d probably stay loyal too , after weighing the pro ##s and con ##s , making a list for myself .
good for you , wish i could say the same for myself . i ' m not unhappy , just got more work to do .
wow . sounds like crazy stuff i wouldn ' t want to get involved in .
sounds like you ' re a lot more mature about it .
i have not played it . are you going to go back to the last and quit playing it ?
yes , i agree . i ' d give it a week .
that ##s good . i hate that your having difficulties .
yeah its tough . but , we just got to keep working .
im so sorry . i know the feeling , im really sorry !
yes , i grew up with him and he got me through my parents splitting up and everything . ( cause i didn ##t have many friends ) . i know everyone always says don ##t get another one too soon but for both my cats that passed and my dog , doing that really is what got me out of the ru ##t .
oh man . at least , you ' ve got some other assignments to bring that back up .
i ' m surprised school started al ##rae ##dy .
is it a major or minor surgery ?
i hope everything goes well !
families are really precious .
ye ##a . so many people take their loved ones for granted .
that is very sweet of them !
it sounds like it , people can be so sweet
that ' s really sweet , i think most people feel the same way as you . families are really important .
i don ' t know what i would do without mine !
when is she getting married ?
oh wow , are you one of the bride ##sma ##ids ?
so many people cheat nowadays . that ' s good to hear !
it is , but we can learn from them and not do the same thing .
that is not good , how much will it cost ?
oh wow , i could not afford that at all
i am sorry , why did you break up ?
that is not fun , sorry to hear that . . .
what is your favorite nintendo console ?
port ##ability ? ah , so it can play all the older games ?

that ' s good to hear . i think family is very important .
i wouldn ' t be the person i am today without my family .

small family .
that ##s sad . but , sometimes people need others to help take care of them .
its good that he ' s there for her .
how did you do that ?
that will do it , sorry to hear that !
did that make you feel em ##bara ##ssed ?
how old were you when you overcame it ?
why are you so tired ?
what is your job ?
people come into our lives for a reason sometimes .

i ' m sorry to hear that .
yep . you just said that .
do you have a guess ?
i do too , that would not be good
that ' s awesome . how did you guys meet ?
oh man . seems like if you didn ' t meet your sweetheart in school , it ' s more difficult to find a girlfriend .
that ' s exciting , what are you doing there ?
watch out for any sp ##ook ##y politicians ha ##ha .
oh man , must make you feel bad .
it ' s better not to compare your situation to others sometimes .
that is a lot of food , hope you can eat all
that makes sense , hope you enjoy it !
she ' s a lucky girl .
not a lot of guys say nice things about their girlfriends behind their back , ha ##ha !
that ' s nice to hear . how did you guys meet ?
you guys still in college ?
that is a lot , i hope he does !
i believe you , that would be hard to get around , a lot of money
wow , have you tried calling it ?
that is not good , where could you have left it ?
they must have really been there for you .
ha ##ha most of the time .
that ' s a lot of money , how did it go ?
that seems un ##lu ##cky . was it your first time in the stock market ?
oh wow . so who was the fairy ?

were they expensive shoes ?
what shoes were they ?
when did you meet them ?
nice . how long have you all been together ?
why is that ?
ah , well did you like the other person ?

i am sorry to hear that , hope you get some more ?
super smash bros is a classic !
how many people do you usually play with ?

i hope you get the job !
interviews can be nerve wreck ##ing .

i like alone time
i think its good to find a healthy balance between being alone and being social
that is super unfortunate , did you manage to save any of the fries by chance ?
i ' m glad that you did not lose all of them , it would be terrible if you did all that work for nothing !
why not ? you only live once get out . make the most out of every day !
sorry to hear that . how did you meet your lady friend ?
i bet that was fun , were you nervous ?
it was probably really exciting though too
a little bump in a relationship should not affect it , that is good . always love and take care of her .
a key to a long relationship is persistence , so keep at it !
oh no ! was he ok ? i hope there was no permanent damage !
that had to be really scary for you . i bet you will never make that mistake again !
wow i could never do that , i really hate heights .
you ' re pretty brave for conquer ##ing that fear .

i know and it is really sad .
you really got lucky that day .

oh wow , bun ##gee jumping is a huge step !
wow , i " m surprised . didn ' t know they were that generous .
oh ok . i was thinking it was new york where the cab ##bies are notorious for being rude .
that ' s awesome , you must have done something right to make a kid so bright .
that ' s the way to do it , clearly .
it could be something good maybe .
i can only imagine how frustrating that is , that ' s why i work at home full time .
i ' m glad you got through it .
how ' s life now ?

you will grow to love it . football is amazing sport . your son will love it .
just wait a few years . if he sticks with it he will be at practice 6 months a year then playing games in the snow .
oh wow . how do you feel about that ?
people get lucky sometimes . it ' s better not to compare yourself to someone else .
are you anxious about it ?
sometimes people are not thoughtful of other people ' s time .
ya ##y ! congratulations ! have you been saving for awhile ?
that ' s so exciting ! best of luck with your new computer !
oh god . i hate that . what did you do ?
i ' m sorry that happened . how much did it cost to repair ?
pajamas are comfortable . no shame in that .
for wearing pajamas ?

oh no ! maybe she needs a break for a wah ##ile
that ' s no good . i guess you ' ll have to find a nice ##r game .
oh , that ' s curious . . . by different , what do you mean ? did you buy different stuff , or go to a different store , or what ?
oh yeah , totally . and then you don ' t end up buying too much or too little , and you don ' t waste time trying to remember things . there ' s also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient .
i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe give it one more try , and if you continue to like it , that might be your sign to stick with it . good luck !
oh my go ##sh , that ' s so annoying ! how did you deal with it ?
that was a good solution ! smart thinking !
well that ' s good , are you enjoying the new stove ?
wow how kind .
it is always a bum ##mer when you borrow something and it breaks right away . you feel responsible and have to replace it .
did you end up buying him a new one ?
were they related ?
that ' s terrible to be yelling at a kid who probably doesn ' t know any better .
i hope she is okay also .
you should go with her next time so that doesn ' t happen .
i hope he ' s okay . i hate when my dog is sick .
what is the dog ' s name ? i ' ll say a puppy prayer for him
must make you feel jealous .
maybe they don ' t even have enough for the cars themselves .
that is weird . do you know what happened ?
that is creepy .
wow that would be a really awesome thing to discover ! did you use it for something fun ?
that is fun for everyone . especially if you ' ve been having hot sunny weather .
you guys sound really happy together .
that ' s wonderful . how long have you been together ?
wow that sounds so scary !
you must be pretty strong to do that .
well that ' s awful ##ly generous of them .
wow are they a very close friend ?
that ' s awful . i ' m so sorry you had to experience that .
guess she ' s estranged for a reason .
nice . when was the last you have seen them ?
why you didn ' t contact them ?
will you explain it to them ?
that ' s understand ##able . hopefully , you won ' t make the same mistake next time .
yi ##kes . did she have to walk ?
look at the bright side . she got some exercise . we all need more exercise .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . what did you guys find ?
you two must miss a lot .
good for you . i loved spending time with my grandma !
she is the sweet ##est woman i have ever met
that sounds crazy !
what happened next ?
nice . did you pre - order ?
sounds like it ' s gonna be a lot of fun .
i know where this is going lo ##l
you obviously weren ' t alone
that should be fun . does he live pretty far away ?
that has to be tough
oh no . did you need it ?
sometimes we forget stuff . it happens .
what happened ?
you could have still eaten it if you were daring .
bright side , it would have been a great excuse to order pizza .
a complete stranger ? how the heck did that happen ? i ' m sure you must be confident that it ' s safe , if they ' re staying with you .
so , are they trying to apply for jobs and stuff ? how long do you think you ' ll let them stay for ?
i think we ' re just another number for them .
i ' m actually doing one now . need better pay . i wish us both the best of luck .
oh no ! which author is it ? that really stink ##s when you can ' t finish a story . an eternal cliff - hang ##er .
that ' s a good idea . i know everyone is worried about that when it comes to george rr martin and game of throne ##s .
wow . he didn ' t get you one , hu ? thanks dad .
that ' s nice of you . i hope he feels better soon .
it ' s great that your kids are having such a great relationship with their grandparents .
ye ##a , they do , but they ' re getting old . makes me scared .
that is a long time . what are you going to do ?
that is good . might be a good time to work on you
that ' s insane ##ly gross .
he will be single forever .
tragic lo ##l
that is a great thought ! what makes you so sure ?
i completely know the feeling . my kids are teenagers and i threaten them every day that i will move in with them when i am old and grey lo ##l .
if only that actually worked , right ? lo ##l
u ##gh that would freak me out ! did you ever find out if it was a real bat ?
oh well that ' s lucky for you ha ##ha my three sons hate bugs !
why is it so shocking ?
well she is married right ? some people say sister in law before its official
that sounds really good . what kind do you like ?
that sounds great
oh . what ' s happening tomorrow ?
i hope you ' re able to tough it out .
that is amazing , did it lower your insurance rates too ?
that is a bum ##mer , but congratulations on the highest score , that is something to be proud of .
oh no ! that sounds awful . were you able to stop on the way home ?
oh goodness ! i am so sorry that happened to you !
that sounds wonderful .
does he have a sister ? lo ##l
holy cow , that ' s impressive . i bet they had to be carried back home . did they even break a sweat ?
ha ##ha , that ' s so funny . i bet it was even fun ##nier to watch . i can kind of understand it - - ph ##o is really popular . i ' ve had it and it ' s not bad . my girlfriend loves it and has it like once a week , along with spring rolls .
oh god , i ' ve been through that . at least , a bike is easy to clean ?
oh man . sorry that happened .
make that wish when you blow out the candles
birthday wishes come true . you will have to work at it still though .
aw how old are they now ?
you definitely need to teach them not to do that .
what time is it there ?
well they should pr ##ba ##bl shut it down soon . it is only thursday .
oh no , how come ?
well , he sounds like he really loves you .
he ' s definitely going to learn a lot . how long will he be away for ?
will you miss him ?
did he take good care of your car ?
that ' s great ! not too many 16 year olds are that responsible .
that ' s awesome . did you get nervous prior ?
it gets easier as you get older . i ' m sure you did great .
that ' s sad . if you can ' t trust your family how can you trust . are you going to say something ?
i don ' t know . if you let it go it could happen again and again .
those were the days . i remember buying 25 cents pops ##icles .
yep . those pops ##icles are like 1 - 3 dollars now
what is it ? am curious .
oh yes , and remember bag ##el bites !
stop making me miss my childhood !
wide open ? or just unlocked ? that ' s crazy ! i guess you got lucky you didn ' t get robbed or have some animals become new roommate ##s . hard to believe decades ago people loved to go to bed with their doors unlocked .
uh oh ! that ' s scary . i bet you won ' t let that happen again . well , i ' m glad everything ended up okay .
that is really a shame . too bad they won ' t get help for the kids
you would think they would be motivated to keep their kids
that is so disappointing . will you stay there ?
that ' s too bad . maybe explore some other options and see how you feel .
that ' s really nice ! what does he usually get at the store ?
sounds a lot like me . i love going through the toys and ga ##dgets section to see if i can find anything for my kids .
i love a good surprise party .
i never get gifts or a party . i need new friends and family
that really stink ##s . what game did she used to play ?
yu ##p . because as soon as you give him a sweet stack of cash , he ' s probably going to blow it at the slots .
ha ##ha , why ?
i disagree with both democrats and republicans .
i am having a similar issue . you shouldn ’ t have to pay for a service they aren ’ t providing .
that just isn ’ t right !
shopping is fun ! what do you plan on getting ?
hopefully you will catch those great deals ! sounds exciting !
that ; s awesome . high school ?
i bet you are so proud . i cried when my daughter graduated 6th grade lo ##l
in terms of grades or something else ?
oh i see now . wow that is pretty lucky !
that ' s awesome that you devoted time to care for him ! how is he doing ?
that ' s great you got him up to a healthy weight ! ku ##dos on you ! i ' m sure those spots will even out eventually .
oh that ' s cool , having a nice new car always feel so sleek and cool .
that ' s good !
ah ! that ' s always such a scary thing , because there ' s such a dread ##ed anticipation that goes along with it , a whole , " will it ? won ' t it ? " kind of game of seeing whether it will head in your direction . i live in the southeast , so i ' ve dealt with worrying about plenty of them .
yeah , there ' s always that fury of activity by everyone to go stock up on gas , groceries , and other materials like batteries , etc . so , did it ultimately end up hitting you , or no ?
i really hope he gets accepted !
you sound like an amazing father . he is so lucky !
i ' ve never watched it but i ' ve heard it ' s really good . maybe i should give it a try
really ? i will definitely give it a try . my favorite tv show is stranger things
i know the feeling .
three dollars ?
nice ! what do you plan to do with a house empty of kids ?
i am glad for you . sometimes kids can be annoying .
stress ##ful . was your work understanding ? is he ok ?
is he feeling better ?
like the cream ##sic ##les ?
you wouldn ' t believe . i ' m eating one right now .
me too . they we ##r 50 cent on the ice cream truck .
that ' s cool . i buy the box of six and don ' t share with anyone
why would you think that ?
why would you think they are jerk ##s ?
you must have lived there for a long time .
wow
i am so sorry to hear that . it will get better .
that seems pretty gross , especially the po ##ss ##ums .
nice and cong ##rat ##s ! how long have you been together ?
that ' s really nice . been thinking about proposing to my girlfriend as well . we ' ve been together for almost the same amount of time .
i ' m sorry who is going in too 8th grade ?
oh awesome ! oh my go ##sh they do . i can ' t believe mine are in their 20 ' s now ! i hate it when they grow up honestly
holy cow that ' s amazing ! good on you ! how much weight have you lost ?
yeah i can relate . i bet you feel and look amazing ! that determination is a quality to behold . keep working hard !
where were you ?
did you forget your lines ?
oh that ' s terrible .
i always hide my sweet whenever i buy any
hmm ##m sounds like an unpleasant job . maybe they ask you for help because you ' re the only one around ? it doesn ' t hurt to help those in need .
that is a fair point . you can ' t have those that are there to protect us be distracted . this is a key tenant when i ' m on watch in the navy .
oh man , i ' m glad you didn ' t get into an accident though . please be careful next time . did he give you a ticket ?
at least he didn ' t take your driver ' s license and tow your car
they did ! that is so terrible !
i ' m sorry , maybe they will get back together .
that is cool , did you film it ?
that is awesome , is this your first kid .
that ' s typically a nerve wr ##ack ##ing experience . did you meet any kind people ?
yeah , if it is a bad neighborhood i suppose .
physics ? i ' m glad i never took that class .
are you looking for a career that involves physics ?
what is your degree in ?
wow , impressive . what do you want to do ?
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that .
well that ' s one nice thing to enjoy . that ' s sweet .
i bet you did great !
but that is still okay . either way you accomplished something difficult !
that ' s the best part of the day
the first sip of a beer is pretty nice too lo ##l
have you met them yet ?
that might be a bad sign
why ?
can ' t you see the driver on the app ?
did you get a ref ##und ?
just eat a sandwich .
how old is she ?
wow that ' s odd . at least you will save some money .
what is her style ?
lo ##l have fun
wow that will surely be a reward ##ing career . i am impressed that you want to help others .
yeah i felt bad luckily he for ##ga ##ve me though .
i ' m sorry to hear that . we ' re all human , and that does happen sometimes . i guess all you can do is do your best to not say or do anything you can ' t take back . is everything resolved now ?
ah , an argument with your spouse ? those are always tricky . i hope you guys can work through it ami ##ca ##bly , because that ' s obviously an important relationship .
wow . how old is she now ?
how old is the valentine
that ##s sweet though
why did you ask for onions then ?
oh i was confused .
well did you get your money back ?
im sorry to hear that .

that ' s no good . are you going to report him to the police ?
yeah , mentally ill people shouldn ' t even be allowed to have dogs . there should be a screening process .
oh my lord ! how are you still alive ?
be careful ! you can pun ##cture your stomach like that and not make it . it happens to those with bu ##lem ##ia all the time . stay safe !
how do you think you did once you took the test ?
i am sure you knocked that test out of the park - sweat or not .

i hope you guys are always safe !
i wish i was a good driver !

that ' s horrible . must have been annoying , huh ?
wow , that ' s very fortunate . mothers are great .
that ' s great ! what ' s going on ?
that ' s nice that you have a friend like that .
wow , that sounds like a very busy household . how are you able to manage them all ?
a nanny is a good idea . would you consider using contra ##ceptive ##s ?
if you don ' t like such movies you should have told him at the beginning so he choose a non scary one
it ' s ok though at least now you know that scary movies are not your kind of movies
ou ##ch ! i know that hurts , been there too . does it feel better now ?
yes , it makes you want to say more than dar ##n , that ' s for sure !
why did you go to the movies by yourself ?
that is great being so independent .
o ##oh , did you pick your own numbers ?
that ' s awesome ! i hope you win !
was it a young kid ? sad nonetheless
oh that ' s great ! i tend to follow some missing children stories closely but i hate when there ' s a sad outcome
o ##oh how fun you must have many adventures planned .
well i hope it is super awesome !
i ' m sorry to hear that , do you know any way to help yourself calm down ?
well you could also try praying !
wow that ' s fantastic !
you are very lucky to have such a smart boy !
holy heck are you okay ? was it like , a fender bender or a full on collision ?
freaking idiots on the road . is your insurance going to be able to cover the damage ?
oh that sucks ! i can barely do 5 without needing a break
that ' s quite unfortunate . i feel for you as i used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce . it ' s rough when there is no competition
where are you going ?
oh that ' s never fun . i hate that too .
that is so cool you are moving into the job market . ya ##y !
i trust you did well too
how does it make you feel when you think about them ?
aw ##w i am sorry to hear that . i hope you can regain contact with them someday . i ' m sure they ' d love to hear from you .
why is that ?
oh maybe you should try joining ac ##hur ##ch .
those were the good times , now kids just want to be on their phones
i used to love riding my bike around the block
oh no , that ' s terrible . can it be replaced ?
what kind was it ?
that ' s sweet of her ! you should put them all together in a nice photo album .
that is very kind . i ' m honestly doubt that my grandma even knows what a printer is .
sorry to hear that . sometimes there can be a technical problem
sorry about that , seems their customer service is not welcoming
some people think they know all the answers . it ' s sad as they usually don ' t grow as much as people
i hope he does , for his sake . but i imagine he will come around
if you report him to his wife , the shame will make him pay you back
then talk to someone that he respects maybe they will talk senses into his " head "
it ' s a chance to turn a new leaf by getting a high score even without cheating
that ' s good . the first step towards turning new is to resolve and take action .
good for you ! stealing from anyone is a really bad offence .
having proof is awesome , otherwise it would make your case a hard one to prove .
wow , i would have been upset ! how did you react ?
are they going to pay you back for it ?
wow , you must have done lots of reading then ? i don ##t get as all the time
that ##s great . they now have confidence in you
no . i hope it was a pleasant day for you and not sad
if you know where you ' re going then you should be
that is very nice
did they brought any special gift ?
that is terrible ! why did you blame him ?
i ' m glad you understand that now .
oh lo ##l , i ' m sure it was embarrassing but it ' s happened to most , so understand ##able .
i ' m sure , i ' d be the same way too !
are you stoke ##d about something good ?
that ' s great ! where are you headed for your vacation ?
do you have anything you want to see there ?
i feel the same as long as i am treated with respect
that is interesting
i have felt like that as well : )
i think the reason is because we want to know if they would fit or not or if we made a mistake or not , that ' s how it is when it ' s not bought from a physical store
wow . you must be very proud
i wonder if he was self motivated
aw ##h , that really bites . it ' s the worst when it feels like everyone is having fun without you .
that ' s right ! it will all pay off for you in a few years .
what is it about them that you don ' t like so much ?
ah yes , i know that feeling . sitting in traffic is a major drag . i find that music or podcast ##s help it go by quicker
aw ##w ! tell me about it will you ?
you should go to red ##dit . com / r / eye ##ble ##ach . there ' s nothing there but cute and nice things to look at . it will ease your soul .
that ' s very unfortunate . that cash ##ier needs to find a job they actually like doing .
they ' re supposed to either do that for you or get someone else to
are you ok ?
i understand . it is difficult to have everyone staring at you
that ' s great ! i don ' t know too many people who look forward to that . you must love your job
great ! i wish i loved my job and work environment as much as you do
i feel the same about my dog . they really are like family members .
i will just think they are happily watching down over us and try to go on one day at a time .
oh really ? ! tell me about it i ' m excited to hear !
oh that is freaking awesome ! cong ##rat ##s ! how are you going to treat yourself ? ?
you must be a very special person to her . is she single ?
too bad , oh well , if things turn around in her status , you have someone in her that you can consider
oh no ! i hope you can make it !
whoa , that ' s quite a walk ! i hope that doesn ' t happen . do you have anyone to call for help ?
oh no , what happened ?
who can blame you ? we are taught to trust professionals .
why ' s that ?
oh excellent . what is your dream car ?
are you buying it outright ?
what color are you shooting for ?
that is a great accomplishment !
congratulations , i ' m sure it will be a good pc .
good memories i take it ? i loved not having to make it myself
aw , well that ' s good that it did . i ' m sure she wanted it to be !
was she a bad employee ?
then what caused you to fire her ?
sorry about that , you could have called a friend
ya ##h , or get a comedy or get to watch a movie
yeah i remember those days too ! what was your favorite gift from a family member ?
go grandma ! what an awesome gift . i bet you were stoke ##d ! : d
excellent ! those thoughts are beautiful . have a good day : )
how exciting ! do you know what your destination will be ?
nice ! it will be a good time to relax and enjoy the beach and night ##life !
oh , i know that feeling ! i only just got my first decent smartphone this past year !
it ' s definitely different than what i was used to . it ' s crazy how fast technology upgrades . sometimes i feel like a cave ##man .
i am sure you will find a great girl soon !
just be patient and everything will fall into place .
oh no ! i hope it goes well as i ' ve heard those can be tricky procedures
you ' ll be fine ! having hope is the best you can do
really ? it is a fine movie
ok . i understand
oh my god . what did you do ?
that ' s great , i hope you weren ' t hurt !
oh that ' s terrible . did he say how he lost it ?
do you remember the title ? maybe you can get another copy .
how was that for you ? are you close ?
i ' ll bet . it ' s always nice to see someone who can bring back good memories .
why ? was it because you didn ' t take those last few moments to spend time with her ? sometimes we have so much going on , we don ' t have time to do it all !
oh , no , i ' m sorry to hear that . you had no idea that would be the last visit , but i can understand how you would feel that way . i have no doubt she understood why you didn ' t though .
o ##oh , that ' s cool ! what did you have in mind ?
that ' s a good idea . what restaurant were you think ##in ?
that ' s awesome . what kind of job ?
you ' ll do great ! that ' s right up your alley .
i ' ve never been in one , but i always assumed they were cleaner !
e ##w , that ' s gross . some people have no sense of dec ##ency .
oh really ? what ' s the good news ?
that ' s great ! what finally con ##vin ##ved the boss ?
it ' s good to get noticed for that . most of the time you only get at ##ten ##ton for messing up !
what model or brand of laptop were you considering ?
nice ! so you ' ve had a good experience with that brand ?
that ' s fantastic ! congratulations ! is it at a restaurant or home prepared ?
that sounds awesome , honestly . i hope you enjoy it !
aw ##w that ' s too bad . what was the cause ?
that ' s pretty rough . were her last years happy , at least ?
i ' m sorry you feel that way . if you feel that you do good , honest work , you should demand better pay !
if it ' s a personal matter , i would definitely take the issue over to human resources . it ' s better to stand up for yourself .
how long has he been a swimmer ?
as you should be . i wish i liked to swim .
oh my go ##sh , that ' s such a heavy thing to think about . did you ask her or confront her ?
well , i hope they ' ve figured it out together during this time .
that sounds like a wonderful surprise . was it something that you had seen before ?
are you going to wear it or put it up for safe keeping ?
those tests can be stress ##ful . how did you do ?
awesome ! congratulations ! it is always nice to accomplish something like that .
sorry to hear that . how that happened ?
i understand . those thing happened from time to time .
that ' s so nice ! what did you get her ?
wow , that is really thoughtful .
ou ##ch that ' s rough . maybe she just isn ' t ready .
do you have any proof ? if so you should bring it up to her .
oh you mean not having enough to pay your rent ?
i am sure there is a special friend that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back
oh no ! are you thinking about buying another one ?
the meaningful ##ness is definitely something you can never replace . i hope that it shows up , and if not , i hope this watch brings meaning to your life in new ways .
wow , that ' s . . . odd . was it for a cake ?
ha ##ha ##ha sorry i just assumed you were 5 years old or something . yeah getting practical gifts is more appealing as one gets older .
what kind of things did you get ?
these days that is a great gift , am i right ?
if it wasn ' t your fault , then what caused you to lose ?
multiplayer games can be fun , but that ' s certainly a downfall to them !
oh my . how did that happen ?
i see . well it ' s an honest mistake . i ' ve done different socks before
you will be fine , just get a new one
i understand how you feel , i used to have one like that , when it passed away , i got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name . with a few month , it looked like the one that passed away so it helped me to forget
really ? did you use marijuana ?
did you ?
wow , i bet that ' s exciting , but also makes you a bit nervous . congratulations though , i ' m sure you are proud to do it !
well , i would probably feel the same way , but i ' m sure you will be great . if they didn ' t have confidence in your abilities , they wouldn ' t have chosen you to do it !
oh no ! i hope you were able to get over the disagreement .
customer service is very important , and it seems like that place needs to work on that .
what ' s wrong with your sight ?
that ' s good , a speed recovery i must say . i com ##men ##d the optic ##ians
well , if the mill ##ea ##ge is not too much and the car is clean go for it
i think in situations like this , you can take someone that knows about cars along
congratulations ! that is such a big step in life .
what is his name ?
what ' s got you feeling down ?
how inc ##on ##ven ##ient ! are you going to take it to a technician ?
what was she doing ?
there is a lot of that type of behavior now . it ' s like people have lost their minds .
that ' s awesome . what did you end up getting ?
i love chocolate cake ! you ' ll have to save me some .
that can be sad , but luckily you can plan to visit them in the future .
yes , using social media really helps us connect with friends and family so much better .
oh ye ##a , i ' ve had it happen a few times . it ' s even worse when they " lose the package " for a while
i don ' t blame you . i try to keep tab ##s on them because i don ' t trust they will be delivered in time . i also set up a camera to catch deliveries that don ' t deliver : }
congratulations ! i ' m sure it ' s well deserved !
how are you going to celebrate ?
i hate having car troubles ! what is it this time ?
my sister is recently going through the exact same thing . it was frustrating for her for a while , but things are looking up for her ! i ' m sure they will for you as well .
of what ?
nice reminiscent
oh yeah ? what about ?
oh no , that is sad news indeed . i am sorry to hear that .
that ' s a shame . is there someone else who can go with you ? i ' m available . lo ##l
i ' m sure she really wanted to go . sometimes we have to make choices we don ' t like . my offer still stands .
what was your experience like ?
i love looking at old photos , both happy and sad moments .
me too ! what did yours look like ?
wow , that must ' ve been really sp ##oo ##ok ##y .
hi
not for the time
i ' m happy to hear that
you must ' ve worked hard to get there
what were you expected to be served ?
so how did you handle it ?
why is that ? and what was
congratulations . you must have the gods smiling on you
happy birthday to him ! what did he get ?
i bet , those sound like awesome presents !
that ' s awful . did you have to cheat ?
i hope she has forgiven you then
oh , no ! i hope you are feeling better ! did you go to the doctor to see why ?
that was very sweet and thoughtful too . glad you ' re better !
wow , that ' s a long time ! ku ##dos to you . it ' s hard for me to imagine being in one place for that long
ye ##a , benefits and pay seem to be the common mo ##tiv ##ators . i ' m glad it worked out so well for you !
you will be alright , it ' s always like that
think about the positive aspects of this , you are moving forward
really ? what sort of things have you done that make you feel that way ?
that sucks , hopefully nothing you can ' t replace . i ' d suggest getting some help if your drinking has become di ##st ##ru ##ctive .
why ? what happened ?
i see . lo ##l . i hate cats , sorry
ok , why would you in the first place ?
well , you played hard ! but did you work hard ?
that ' s ok

this is true . i have often been told that i am the best .
where do you go to school ?
whoa ! what was in that burr ##ito ?
wow , that ' s a food challenge type of thing ! did they get anything out of it ?
that ' s great ! what was it about ?
i ' m glad you really enjoyed it !
good for you . don ' t live with regrets . learn from mistakes and move on .
that ' s a weird term to use
why ? did something bad happen to you ?
well , i ' m glad no one was hurt at least . : )
that ' s cool ! has it been a good transition ?
it can be stress ##ful sometimes . i am glad to hear you found something good .
that ##s sweet . how long have they been married ?
yes it is . . that ##s great that their love has lasted so long .
that ' s good ! you should always encourage your children ' s talents and let them grow
i do not . i am still pretty young so i ' d like to wait a few more years . i don ' t think i ' m quite ready
oh that ' s good . you will make some good money while having a good time remembering childhood
oh ok i understand
lo ##l . sorry . was it embarrassing or did you laugh it off ?
oh my . but why do you care if they ' re your cousin . .
really ? please tell me more
so what did you do ?
that is quite interesting . you must be proud of yourself !
i am glad you are . a good career is essential to live a healthy life .
cong ##rat ##s ! where are you going ?

im glad . . it seems like we both are getting the vacation ##s we need !
that ' s great to here . anything good happen recently ?
sounds like you are doing great . those are among the best things in life .
you did super well i guess
your parents must be really proud of you

luckily it will heal soon and you can feel back to normal .
that ##s so sweet .
that ##s super nice , thanks for sharing .
oh no ! was it traumatic ?
that ' s nuts ! i would have been so scared
the little ones always feel so fragile , what did you do ?
little ones love rocker ##s or swings , did you have a good time watching your cousin ?
what grade did he get ? he doesn ' t have to get an a in everything .
that ' s quite harsh for getting one bad grade . you should encourage him to do well without being so rash .
i am sorry to hear that , you can take it again though and try to get a better grade !
oh , that is not good . you should have done better !
well , good thing is you realized your mistakes
you should get your mind ready for the worst if he does not take it too well
that ##s always a good thing . did you give them a fun reward ?
that ##s so cool . . i live in orlando . . i ' ll wave to you guys !
wow ! that is really impressive !
luckily the phone didn ' t fall and crack the glass ! those phone covers aren ' t the best .
i bet he was stoke ##d .
ye ##a i 100 % agree with that .
oh wow , what subject is it on ?
well i hope you do good either way .
that is sad , why were you not able to go ?
oh maybe next time !
i ' m sorry to hear about that . i hope you both can find a way to work things out with each other .
oh , that ' s too bad . well then i hope you can find happiness again in the future . good luck to you !
that was nice of you . what type of food did you bring ?
i see . that was nice of you to repay your friend with the meal .
oh that sucks sounds like a good movie tho .
ye ##a the c ##gi in movies is stellar .
oh no . don ' t say that ! i start a new job today !
why don ' t you talk to yours ? im so sorry !
that is disgusting ! you must talk to him about this !
incredible , kick him out of the house !
oh no ! sorry to hear that . how are you planning to get it fixed ?
ah , i see . well i hope you figure it out soon . you need a way to get around town !
that sounds fun ! i ' ve never been myself , but i ' ve always wanted to
i shall : ) i need to make myself get out more . it would be good for me
maybe you should buy it for keep sake
oh ok , i understand
oh that ' s got to be very tough ! i ' m sorry to hear that . how did you respond ?
that would be pretty shocking overall ! i hope you ' re able to move on from this somehow .
oh really find anything cool ?
ye ##a all of the nostalgia can do that .
you must felt really lonely because you need friends in college
i bet it can . i had no friends in college either .
cong ##rat ##s . i hope you ' ll like what you ' re doing
that ' s like the tough ##est job out there .
uh oh ! so what happened ? did you end up passing it ?
that ' s great . good for you , bud .
where did you land in then ? india or something ?
aw well that seems like it would be a great time ! i hear the beaches are beautiful .
oh my goodness ! why did you do that ?
you should tell your wife to clear your guilt .
oh my god ! . i hope he loves her as much as you do
did she know that you crushed on him ?
oh that sounds kind of wo ##rri ##some .
well that ##s a relief .
did he ? where do you both go to school ?
i bet it was , college is such a great time .
wow that sounds pretty stress ##ful . how do you think you did ?
as long as you did your best , i say have no regrets . you made the most of a bad situation .
that ' s great ! i ' m happy for you . will you be getting a raise ?
i ' ll cross my fingers alongside you . it sounds like you deserve it !
oh that must have been awkward . did you two talk to each other ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you don ' t dwell on it too much and can be happy in the future .
wow , where did you do that ?
that ' s awesome ! i really want to go para ##gli ##ding someday .
oh my , what did you do ?
its okay , hopefully it was not too expensive ##1
that ' s a very exciting time in life . do you have any preference for gender ?
i ' ve heard that as well . i ' m male i know i was much closer to my mom .
that ' s great , congratulations
he will turn out to be a great man
o ##of i know how that can feel .
ye ##a that would help clear you con ##cision
ok how did you manage the situation ?
i think you should have talked to the hostel management to help you out on this as well
that has got to be hard on the poor guy . did you offer any help ?
i see . well he ' s probably still there .
oh wow ! that ' s horrible ! did it fall down the drain ?
well hopefully she should be able to forgive you . it was an accident .
they ' re not very good friends then . you should confront them about this .
could be , hopefully the won ##t dismiss you like that in the future !
oh my , i hate when that happens . it makes me so angry .
i would be too , some people shouldn ##t be driving .
oh ye ##a why is that ?
oh wow that ##s so stupid of him .
that is great , did you get the license ?
well hopefully you ace it !
that sounds great ! what ' s your meeting about ?
that sounds really interesting . hopefully you ' ll get rewarded for your great performance !
oh that sucks but i think he should understand the situation .
that ##s unfair of him .
oh i ' m sorry to hear that . were you hu ##rr ##t ?
hopefully insurance will be able to cover the car at least .
oh wow that is an awesome car .
i can imagine you would , its an awesome situation .
you shouldn ##t feel bad . it happens to all of us at some point .
its okay , it was just an accident .
i would be really frustrated with that as well . did you exchange the colors ?
well it sounds like she ' s listening to you at least .
congratulations . you have done well
i wish i can attend a party for this if there is
i agree , these shop mechanics can be extremely knowledge ##able when it comes to computers .
ye ##a but at least now you have found a good , trust ##worthy place .
well that sounds like a good thing to do .
well i ' m happy for you as well that your needs are being meet .
he should be understanding of that and not keep on . that ' s just frustrating for everyone involved
sounds very immature if you ask me
om ##g ! , does the place have camera ? at least so that the police can track down the person
if you have insurance i think you will be fine
oh that sucks , i know how that feels , its why i got an extra job online
ye ##a it was scary but im happy its not bad anymore .
i agree . do you have a new car ?
oh cool . i love visiting car shows myself .
ok let me in on it
so what was the experience like ?
why does that make you feel bad ? you ' re allowed to have fun sometimes .
oh that would be tough . have you told your partner ?
you must be quite hopeful to get this new job then ! i hope you do as well .
i agree , but stay positive . there is nothing you can do now .
i hope i will still be helping my kids when they are grown up . i like to feel they will always need me .
yes , but they can be a bit of a challenge when they are growing up !
you should def ##ini ##tley pick them up again . don ' t let age stop you !
lo ##l well as long as you ' re fairly active and fit it shouldn ' t be too big of a problem .
why , did you hesitate in the first place ?
i see than , i could tell you that you should just overcome yourself and do it , but its you own personal business . . .
wow that sounds rough ! have you told your wife about it ?
i could imagine . i hope you ' re able to work through this somehow .
is there still time to get one ? you can if you hurry !
hmm i think you should make it up to her somehow . take her to an expensive dinner .
oh my goodness . who is that guy ?
what an imp ##ost ##or .
it ' s a great stage in your life , what is he major ##ing in ?
well i wish luck to both of you .
is there anything that could spoil that ?
seems like you took all the precautions , the rest is not up to you .
i hate when that happens . things always seem to go that way .
all you can do is just keep doing the best job you can and hopefully someone will notice someday .
your dog doesn ' t keep you good company ?
i guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness .
cong ##rat ##s . boy or girl ?
i ' m having a boy soon . 3 months or so
sorry to hear that . i hope he is okay now
he will be okay as long he got the tr ##at ##ment
well , early happy birthday . what will you do to celebrate ?

oh no , sorry hope it wasn ' t a snake . my hound dog is al ##way ##d barking .
ya ##h , lost my job and trying to find a new one .
oh my , that is along time . did you feel nos ##tal ##gic ?
i see , you should re ##kind ##le your friendship .
i know that feeling ! maturity i suppose
its that feeling you have to live with for now . . lo ##l !
why , what did you do , to feel like that ?
are you planning to make up for it ?
you are so lucky to have such caring sister
i hope you can rec ##ip ##ro ##cate by sending her a birthday message when it ' s time for it so she knows you care for her
i ' m really sorry to hear that . how long did you have it for ?
that ' s really tough right now . i hope you ' re doing something fun to keep yourself occupied .
i really hope you are alright . did they catch him ?
do you at least remember how he looks ?
are ' t you afraid to catch the fever ?
good for you , i hope your sister gets well too .
what do you mean they stepped up but you still had the title . wouldn ' t they be the ones with that ?
oh cool . well i ' m happy for you guys
oh what were they doing to you
oh , elderly people are little tough to understand
yeah that ##s very nice to apologize to elderly people
oh wow . . where did you all go ?
that was so great of your friend
aw ##w , i ' m sorry . it sure would solve a lot of problems , wouldn ' t it ?
what ' s the first thing you would do if you won a few million ?
oh wow , you should have known better
try harder next time and im sure you will do better !
i agree , i love fridays , did you have any plans ?
sounds like a great plan . also a great way to get diabetes !
why aren ##t you taking a vacation with them ?
perhaps you could invite someone over to your place and watch a cool movie with them over a pizza ?
really ?
what happened ?
5 what ?
i would like that much money !
what business ?
did you have a back up plan ?
well , now you that such is life , it makes plans for you .
i agree , i dislike tuesday ##s because they are so far from friday !
i would have been too . you should have just slept all day !

nice , did you beat him up ?
oh yes . i love that show i can relate to real life families .

that ' s a great feeling , i agree ! i rarely get a day where i just stay home

i like to be lazy as much as i can .
sorry about that . i know how it feels , especially with the family concerns
please never stay idle , fix yourself anywhere , i mean somewhere
oh wow that is terrible i hope you recover everything that was taken from you
i completely understand i have had my car broken into a few times and had objects that held value and were sentimental to me as well
good luck ! have you studied for it ? do you feel prepared ?
don ' t be paranoid . that just upset ##s you . try to think po ##sit ##iv ##ley .
that sounds ag ##gra ##vating . did you say anything to her ?
that ##s okay , you should call the police next time .
yeah , tuesday is just the beginning of the week and more to go . is that why ?
so true
it always feels exciting to do something big at work . it always feels good to feel like you are making progress in your career .
also , maybe this is something you can put on your resume and it will look good in the future .
sorry about that . you should try again and stay confident . the most important is to try .
good . stay focus and you will have success . we always learn something in our good and bad experiences .
congratulations . are you going by yourself ?

why does being cool matter though ? wouldn ' t you rather just be yourself ?
oh yeah . . what happened ?
that is the worst . . i ' ve had that happen to me before !
it is nice to have your own place . think about just being able to do whatever you want . you can just punch your walls if you want .
it ' s ok just think about it this way . you don ' t have to pay property taxes or even be worried about your lawn .
do you live in the midwest

i have those kinds of feelings as well . i think memories are a good thing though
i can understand that for sure , just remember the good ones
that sounds really nice ! did you enjoy yourself and relax ?
it is a good feeling when you get to just relax and feel laid back .
ha , that will be fun though
ha , i bet it will be fine
that must have felt sort of defeating . there is still hope if there isn ' t a ring on her finger !
try not to feel that way . if it was meant to be , it would have happened . there are plenty of other fish in the sea !
oh wow that is awesome . i remember when those came out . everyone wanted to have one !
it ' s crazy how many toys they have now . disney is really pushing the merchandise out !
how ' d he do that ?
sounds like a mess , how much did it cost to replace ?
oh that ' s not good ! what happened ?
that ' s always a pain ! it can take forever but never lasts long enough
man , that is so sad . i don ' t know what i would do if my dog ran away ! did you ever find him ?
that ' s awesome ! i love a happy ending !

that can happen , iv ##e seen deer walk across a highway
oh my goodness , that is terrible . they don ' t have insurance ?
i was just about to mention that you should be careful that its not a sc ##am of some sort .
oh my . that would really tick me off . in my state they will lose their license for that .
well i hope your insurance company sue ##s them . they should really be more responsible .
in a good way or bad way ?
a lot of people are su ##pr ##ised by the gdp
whoa , that is a good neighbor . i hope you return the favor some time !
dan ##g . i bet there is a great story of how it got there !

wow ! maybe i should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own .
oh wow . do you think you are going to go ?
that ' s pretty neat . where is it at ?
that sucks ! bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport
you should join a league and meet some friends with similar interests .
that ' s odd . were they laughing about you ?
oh wow . you always have to be on the look out for the rogue rip in the pants ! that ' s what got my uncle late in life . rip in peace .
whoa i hope you guys have a great honeymoon . make sure to treat your fiancee right !

well , i guess canada doesn ' t like to take any shit from trump

i would be so mad . i am terrified of snakes .
when i was a kid i used to have nightmares that i was on a bridge in a car and the whole car and bridge were covered in snakes . it was awful .
i just read about that today . do you think he will be ready for it ?
he definitely is cool to watch .
what did they call about ?
wow that is a long time ago .
that ' s no good .
people aren ' t to ##ler ##ating that type of behavior anymore . she had better watch it .
are you the mother or father ? time flies so fast . .
i bet she is going to be a great person when she is older
what happened ?
i bet you are super jealous !
she was probably disappointed at you .
are you upset about this ? i ' d try meeting hr in person
should have grabbed the gun .
i would have shot that thing dead and then burned it . then ate it for dinner .
that is good to hear . disabilities are never easy for people .
nothing upset ##s me more than people getting handicapped plates and not being handicapped .
maybe he should give you a raise so you can stay .
well you have to think about yourself .
really ? which one was it ?
was that in the united states or somewhere else ? i used to love all my children and general hospital .
sounds like fun ! i wonder if you could find old episodes online now .
oh , cool ! any names i might know ?
i was just talking about this with my friend . they are getting too old
i know right .
did you have plans to pick up something special ?
i know that was probably embarrassing then but can you at least laugh about it now ?
are you making some good progress ?
you must be quite proud , how much can you lift ?
i can ' t imagine my house on fire . that ' s i got home insurance !
i hope you didn ' t lose too much .
yeah , the crime rate has steadily been rising . not good .
i miss the good ol ' days too !
that is awesome . i bet she worked really hard to get that promotion . good for her .
cool , i hope she continues to be successful . it ' s good you are encouraging her !
it feels nos ##tal ##gic , what did you like most about that time period ?
must ' ve been nice , being so free and enjoying your time .
yes , i didn ' t like it at all . i ' m not into jump scares .
yeah , no thank you for me .
was there any reason why ?
that ' s awesome , i ' ve never had good neighbors so i ' m pretty jealous of you !
i call my sister that all the time .
oh . i ' m sorry . we do that to each other . i didn ' t know she hurt your feelings .
that ##s sucks i download games so i don ' t have that problem
i used to have that problem too . download ##ing would take days . technology saved me there .
oh no , why is that ?
well as long as they ' re good people than it shouldn ' t be that bad .
what did she do ?
have you told her not to do that ?
it went by fast .
that sucks . everyone deserves a va ##ca ##y .
oh no , that ' s the worst to spend time cooking something and then taking a bite and it ' s awful .
i ' ve done it before so i feel your pain .
nice ! are you going scuba di ##vn ##g ?
ah , got ##cha . sounds delicious !
what did you carry for her ?
you ' re so sweet for doing that , did she thank you ?
what ah ##app ##ened to the vase ?
people still play with those ?
who did she blame ?
well if the cat didn ' t tell the truth he didn ' t mind at ##king the fall .
hey . it happened to me . it could happen to you too !
have you ever put butter in your noodles . it el ##eva ##tes them lo ##l
i ' ve never used cheese . learn something new every day .
you know , thinking about it . i don ' t think i ' ve ever had a honey bun . . .
wow , that sucks . i bet you are so disappointed . . .
what kind of list is that ? are you bringing them some christmas cookies ?
oh so maybe you will leave some coal on their doorstep instead . they should be more consider ##ate .
ok . that ' s kinda neat .
oh i know how that feels .
aw ##w that ' s sweet ! how old are your kids ?
yeah i like to have pictures of my loved ones and pets and such at work . it really helps when i ' m having a rough day .
oh no . i would have screamed .
that ' s nice . no police were involved ?
well at least you ' re safe .
that ' s nice .
aw . no one cooks for me : (
i ' m sorry to hear that . what ' s holding you back ?
you ' ll get there one day !
just keep working at it .
wow , the last one ? how many seasons have they made ?
i need to watch that show in my free time . everyone i know talks about that show constantly !
did you get an a ?
come clean and take an f then
me too . i can focus on myself for a while
i feel the same way .
at least you are thinking back on it and doing some self - reflecting .
that ' s so mean . i bet he just wanted to say good morning to you .
what did you do ?
did you buy a new battery ?
yeah , i really liked those hunting trophies he got . we should be allowed to kill any animals we see !
oh i was thinking of his son . i don ' t know much about the donald besides the twitter stuff .
no , that ' s a little too expensive for me .
it ' s snails , isn ' t it ? why would anyone want to eat that is beyond me .
that is terrible . what was it for ?
now that ' s a no no . kill him
oh wow . i have no advice there .
maybe you should calming ask about it .
what are you planning on buying ?
you self - entitled brat ! just kidding , your mother loves you
storms ? why ?
everything closes when we get an inch of snow in the south .
what is this weekend ?
have you met them before ?
i am waiting for halloween . its my favorite .
lo ##l . i do themes with me and my kids . then i eat all of their candy
that ' s awesome . you guys sound very close !
that is so messed up lo ##l
oh yeah ? i heard the circus had to close recently . what is your favorite part ?
elephants are pretty cool . i wonder if they actually like peanuts ?
did you clean it again ?
that was nice of them .
congratulations
well that a good thing to study too
im in school now for psychology . its so boring
what do you miss most about being a kid ?
just relaxing and playing ?
how old will you be ?
maybe they will party at your house after .
they did ? i ' ve never seen a baseball game lo ##l
there are some real die ha ##r fans i mia ##ght have to check it out
i don ' t believe you .
how did you get the opportunity to meet him ?
what will be lit ?
that sounds boring .
that is scary ! as a 26 year old i cannot imagine actually having kids at this age . i ' d be running around like a chicken
that ' s rough ! i ' m glad you ' re ok now ( i hope ) , but that must have been really traumatic
oh no ! did you have a cell phone or did anyone come out to help you ? i literally hate car problems .
oh great ! i do not have that kind of knowledge at all - maybe you could come with me on the next road trip - lo ##l ! !
what kind did they get ?
are you a bit jealous ?
it ' s sad actually . but be happy she become independent .
yeah , let her free .
that ' s crazy ! i hope to propose one day . congratulations !
that ' s great ! disney is a wonderful place to go . i actually live near the magic kingdom !
u ##gh , that is so annoying . did you say anything ?
good , maybe he ' ll learn not to be a jerk next time .
did you try taken him to a specialist to help with that ?
did you try closing your room ?
rainy days are boring , but i do like the sound of them . it ' s calming in a way
ye ##a , it is better in mode ##ration . that ' s true
who ?
that ' s terrifying . i refuse to swim in the ocean . too scary .
glad you are both safe .
well , at least you followed the law and didn ' t end up running a red light .
yes , better safe than sorry i guess .
no , but i heard about it in commercials
i will try on do this asa ##p , dude yesterday i forgot to pay some money i owed my friend , i felt kinda of ashamed
i got pay ##ed , went shopping ate dinner , then my friend message ##d me asking for his money . . . . i had totally forgot about this
well , maybe your friend will understand .
i know how you feel .
that is a great accomplishment !
yeah , kids grow up so fast !
that makes me mad
some people should be more consider ##ate
where did you move to ?
im sorry . . i moved once from md to fl so i know how you feel being without your pee ##ps .
oh . that ' s kind of exciting though
well be yourself . if it doesn ##t work out , think of it as practice !
hey great ! what did you eat ?
it is good to just treat yourself sometimes !
oh don ' t feel bad ! we need to treat ourselves sometimes !
that ##s terrible .
i have heard of that .
i ' m so sorry for your loss .
oh , i remember those days .
are you going to punish them for it ?
what did you do ?
i have had that happen a few times .
why is he 2 now ?
it won ' t last much longer . before you know it he will be grown up and married .
by yourself ?
well you should enjoy it
that sounds nice . what did you get ?
that is terrible . i am so sorry
i wish my family lived close . you are lucky
we see each other once a year .
how so ? just used to the way things are ?
oh no , are there things you could do outside of your comfort zone ? things you never considered before ?
that ' s awesome .
that ' s great . i hope she likes the new position .
why are you so nervous ?
okay , i totally understand your feelings .
that ' s great . what is he doing now ?
that ' s even more awesome . i hope he does well .
i do that a lot .
ain ##t that the truth !
that ##s cool that you have one every year .
that could be fun !
that ' s great . i ' ve never gotten a bonus ##e at work .
i just went on a va ##ction with my kids . its was so relaxing . have fun
are you tired ?
i understand . taking some rest is important .
did you get caught ?
don ' t feel too bad . its not like the government gives you money once a year .
oh no , is there a storm approaching ?
that is a very good idea .
i ' m sure they ' re not - what makes you think that ?
perhaps next time the bill arrives , say something like , " ok , so that ' s $ 25 each " and take out $ 25 and put it on the table . they may take the hint .
cong ##rat ##s ! that is great !
that is definitely something to be proud of .
what happened ?
sometimes when kids are young they don ' t get the importance of school
that can be nerve wreck ##ing .
do you think you did well ?
how far are you going ? what school ?
way cool ! congratulations ! should be a great experience
i hope you get a good grade . were you well prepared ?
so , you don ' t have to worry about it .
aw , that ' s so sad , i hope you had fun though
at least you had fun , too bad the friend missed out , their loss
oh cool ! how pregnant are you ?
oh ##hh ##h so you already had her ! congratulations !
that would be annoying . how about meeting up with a friend or something ?
i ’ m sorry . what are you going to do ?
i like being emotional
i bet . its probably cheaper than therapy though !
what did you do ?
lo ##l . i ' ve done that before .
sometimes we don ' t have it . god knows .
i would imagine so . it is difficult to be away from family for long .
that would probably do the trick . if not , video call your family to touch base more often ?
that ##s awesome . where are you wanting to go ?
i live near disney . . have you ever been ?
that can be stress ##ful . is she ok ?
i ’ m so sorry to hear that .
wow , that rocks !
i love winning things . it just makes the whole day perfect , lo ##l .
that ' s kind of you
i bet she really appreciate ##s you
when does it come out ?
what is it about ?
wow , that sucks .
that ' s kind of you to help her through hard times !
i am sure you will do great .
good luck !
lo ##l . are you em ##bar ##rase ##d ?
i don ' t like that either .
what did you do ?
that ' s no good . did you get anything good with it ?
that is something to be grateful for .
my boyfriend once said if he ever had to be in a wheelchair he wanted me to kill him . i broke up with him
how old are they ?
it ' s always nice to have a balance in life
i bet you are app ##re ##hen ##sive .
they sound very selfish trying to blackmail you like that . i would tell the teachers or professors asa ##p
i am very content with having no car .
that can be very un ##hea ##lth ##y for you but it ' s so convenient
yeah that stuff is addict ##ing
i love tom hardy !
he is . and he is nice to look at too lo ##l
what is the dish ?
maybe she can help you and guide you step by step
oh no !
you had better sleep with one eye open
me too , i like to see them as inspiration
if you work hard enough maybe you can afford in the future !
what is the class ?
economics is pretty cool
are you a guy too ? i bet you were en ##vious of his looks and age ha ##ha ##h
nice , i bet it was super fast !
i hate them too . i haven ##t been on one in ten years .
i would be fine if i never rode one ever again
that ' s terrible . won ' t the bank help you out ?
i ' m sorry . that really sucks
are guitars expensive ?
does she want an acoustic or electric one ?
what shows are you referring to ?
i ' ll need to check that out !
that ' s terrible . will you be able to get it back ?
well at least you will get it back though .
how long were u together
well then maybe you ' re better off lo ##l
nice , is it expensive ?
i bet you are so proud of yourself ! i need to learn how to be self re ##lian ##t like you !
congratulations ! what ' s the job ?
o ##oo ##oh ##hh fancy ! lo ##l
that ' s nice of you , do you usually let her go out ?
my parents usually did that do . if i don ' t do the chores around the house , i don ' t get to head out
lo ##l . that sucks
that has happened to me once or twice .
dan ##g , that sucks . did you find another class that is open ?
i hate it when that happens .
good luck . what is the class ?
lo ##l . good luck anyway
that is terrible . what can you do ?
i am sure they will work with you . don ' t stress out .
aw ##w . that ' s nice . did you dos ##ome ##thing special ?
i wish my parents would get my kids . they are too busy having fun themselves lo ##l
oh no , do you know what ' s wrong ? i hate car problems . .
last time my car had problems , i had to spend so much money . it was awful .
you should definitely first talk to your friend and clear out the concerns with him before talking to his partner
as i said , first ask your friend why is he be ##ha ##ving in such an unacceptable way
are you going to tell me ?
you ' re not the only one . i am afraid of complete silence . i think i ' m about to be murdered .
im almost afraid to ask
ha ##ha ##ha i am so not one of those people . i am too old for the technology !
i know right . i was just talking about that with my friends .
tell who what ?
it ' s okay . you ' ll get through it , and yes you should tell her lo ##l
i hope it didn ' t rain
good thing nothing bad happen ! i would be so devastated if my phone got stolen like that !
that sounds awesome ! what are you going to do ?

what part is that ?
is it the lead role ?
lo ##l . . you crack me up .
what kinda gun do you have ?

that is annoying . have you thought about talking to them ?
4
7
what are they pictures of ?
those were the best ! weren ' t they ?
that sounds bad . are you alright ?
it sounds like you need so ##e distance from them
are you a helicopter parent ? do you spin ?
maybe you have went so long without hanging with your friends you forgot you had them .
oh . that ' s terrible .
what is dig ##ior ##no ?
did you give them a home ?
well that ' s nice . every one deserves to be in a safe and loving home .

its awesome . . . you can win 50 - 100 often on a 5 $ scratch off . .
cool , where are you heading to ?
oh wow ! i always thought kangaroo ##s were really interesting animals !
that sounds like fun ! what kind of park is it ?
great ! make sure to pack suns ##creen . hot here where i am
that sounds terrible . what can you do ?
i definitely agree you need to set up the boundaries . make sure you keep that up for the sake of everyone involved .
i had to buy a fruit fly trap this summer as well . but as soon as i set it up they stopped flying around .
i feel your pain . . i really do !
oh lord , i hate the vet ##s ! what happened ?
oh man ! you know some med ##s can cause that . look in too simi ##las ##an . they have one that prevents cat ##ara ##cts etc . expensive ingredients but some are the some from people and dog med ##s for cat ##ara ##cts / dry eye etc .
that sounds great . what do they like to do in the yard ?
that is so sweet . i hope the weather stays nice
going for a road trip ?
awesome , sounds like fun ! i hope you have a safe trip .
aw ##w , how cute . do you miss playing with your cat ?
it ' s alright . your cat is somewhere up in heaven .
what are you going to school for ? online or in person ?
oh that is tough ! oh man , especially at an alternative one . make sure you do a lot of self care and don ' t take stuff too personally from kids : )
what did that do . .
i am sorry that someone did that to you . .
i know how you feel . i hate lair ##s .
but you have to do it otherwise you won ##t be able to trust her .
that ' s unfortunate . especially when there ' s nothing you can do to stop it .
it can be a vicious cycle . i ' ve seen it before .
oh man ! are they car keys as well ?
oh my god ! well please get all your locks changed . the car will be more difficult however hopefully they have no idea where you live so you should be ok .
oh god ! how did you get in finally , did you contact your mom ?
that is very difficult . i wish you will find a solution .
i understand . take it easy .
what are you studying ?
oh great ! that has a lot of jobs . i hope you did well !
tell me about it ! i think about getting off as soon as i walk in !
yeah . a job is better than no job , i suppose .
that is no good . i bet he regrets it !
i hope so that is frustrating .
aw ##w , that is so sad to hear . i ' m glad that she has a good home now , though !
that ' s amazing ! i wish more people were willing to do what you ' re doing to help out our furry friends !
what are the pro ##s of switching jobs ?
well actually desk jobs are much harder on my body and can be really bad for your back and hips etc , if it ' s a desk job ? well if you are getting older you might want to start saving up , have a side hu ##stle and maybe think about it ? less pay but more peace , health and time is always worth it : )
i also have a dog that was starved when she was young ! she is so afraid of everything even to this day , but she ' s almost 8 !
what breed of dog is she and how old ? that ' s so awesome ! dogs are so res ##ili ##ent and it can teach us a lot about how we should live our own lives .
awesome ! mine is also a pit ##bu ##ll mix ! i call her my little bunny in pit ##bu ##ll form ! they are the best dogs ever .
oh ##h ! i love chickens ! i have always wanted some . i have a duck ! lo ##l - what kind of chickens are they ?
oh man ! they fight sometimes . i hope they aren ' t too bad about waking you up in the morning . chickens can be very sweet though !
maybe you should be straight with him ? that ’ s the only thing that will make it good in my opinion .
i know the type . there are better people out there that you just have to be patient for .
were you all best friends as children ?
oh gee ##z , that ' s hard ! i am glad you get to see them again . treasure such moments !
now that ' s dedication !
keep it up . one day you might appear in a fitness magazine .
i love that when that happens ! what is it for ?
love that ! glad you found it
yeah , dogs have to learn how to play . kinda funny you don ' t always consider that .
it depends on how young they are . i have a rescue that was abused but she was real young . she snapped out of it .
i ' m great how are you doing ?
what ' s wrong ?
that ##s great to hear , getting along better with the other students ?
that ##s awful , i hate bullying have you told the principle ?
what did they advice , any martial arts schools around your area , maybe start your kid in it
do you know who sent them ?
awesome , was there any special occasion ?
i bet that was fun to look through
that would be cool . are you going to keep them ?
i hope that you did well on them
that ##s great
i can ' t stand people who treat animals horribly .
i hope you call the cops on them , so they can go to jail for animal abuse .
i understand . did you catch some of them in action ?
that is bad . i would have the same feeling if i was in your situation .
i hear you ! how old are you ? as we get older , all kinds of stuff doesn ' t work the same
try ke ##to and fast ##ing , or find a diet like raw and you will be amazed at your energy and strength again !
some people have incredible energy and drive !
true ! often managers do not deserve that role . i am glad he does !
oh my god , i hate when people do that ! that stuff can land on someone ' s windshield !
wow , that ' s horrible ! i would have been so pissed .
oh my goodness ! why did he move away ?
are you all still together ? long distance can be hard but honestly absence makes you love them even more !
how come you can sit also ?
that ’ s too bad
that is nice . baby ##sit ##ting kids is sometime nice .
how old are they ?
that is terrible . how do they get away with it ?
i am sorry you have to deal with that
that is always good ! er ##rand ##s can be a pain !
i am glad you got some things done ! now you can rest
i guess i never thought about weather or not car insurance covers your own injuries too
yeah they ' re really expensive .
it ' s been a mix of a roller ##co ##aster lo ##l .
wow ! are you going to stay now ?
i understand ! i would be too !
that is great , what was wrong with the dog , how was it abused
that is absolutely awful to hear , poor dogs don not deserve to be mist ##reate ##d in such ways , im happy the dogs better
me also when i was young .
i understand
that is disappointing . i am sorry
have you tried talking to them ?
i hate bull ##ies , but they usually get what ' s coming to them .
i know how you feel . sometimes you just have to show them the error of their ways . if not karma will catch up with them .
that is incredibly kind of you , i hope he is a good driver : )
you are a great friend ! we all need help at some point
oh wow ! i ' d be afraid to go outside ! i hope you are able to stay safe !
that sounds very scary . ever thought of moving ?
i wish you luck ! i really hope you can get out of there soon .
i hear you ! have you thought about starting a side business ?
great ! there are so many opportunities out there with the internet
that is very nice of him to welcome that poor dog
that is really cool . good on you for welcoming them
pay ##day is fantastic ! what kind of clothes did you buy ?
do you ever use po ##sh ##mark or mer ##car ##i ? those are good for deals . sounds like you got some nice stuff ! pay ##day is always a fun day
i so hear you ! lo ##l ! being grown up has it ' s per ##ks but it ' s not as great as we thought it would be with all the responsibilities . we are the mom and dad now ha
i freak ##in hate that , like dude be sad or mad on your own don ##t take it out on your family , friends , or co workers
exactly great minds think alike , that is always so annoying as hell
that is good to hear ! are there any issues ?
oh lord : ( i have a partner doing the same thing and he feels more like a son a lot . that must be so hard . being a parent is the hardest job ever . i am so very sorry . i hope he snaps out of it soon .
how come you were worried about it ?
it sounds like it might be time to consider moving on without them
things were much simpler when we were kids . you are your brother must have a close relationship .
i ' m sorry to hear that . i guess it makes the times you do see each other even more special !
oh no ! was anyone around ?
that is no good . i bet that was embarrassing .
that ' s disgusting . did you move to another table ?
that ' s awful . some people are disgusting .
i am sorry to hear that . how are you feeling now ?
i understand . it is tough .
wow , that doesn ' t happen very often . well done . those things are normally quite expensive , aren ' t they ?
me too . clearance is the first place i head for in the store ! it must be so difficult to be g ##lu ##ten into ##ler ##ant - seems as if there ' s g ##lu ##ten in everything these days .
something i found which helped me lots was to eat e . g . bread made from organic wheat . so long as i don ' t over ##ind ##ul ##ge i ' m fine - fingers crossed .
boy , you are having a tough time . someone suggested buying imported pasta from italy as the wheat doesn ' t have the same pest ##icides sprayed on it as us wheat . dunn ##o if it works tho ' .
how long has it been ?
whoa ! so needed ! what did you guys do ?
i am sorry that you had to go through that .
that is too bad . it sounds like you need some knew people to surround you
you were suppose to start the conversation with a situation based on the context chosen .
i hope the hit will not be rejected .
im sorry to hear that , i was born with a lot of anxiety so i can somewhat relate
i honestly started taking cb ##d oil by charlotte ##s web , and my anxiety went away after a few days of using it
oh ! that is the best isn ' t it ? what will you do with it ?
oh awesome ! it ' s always nice to have those little surprises in life .
what good thing are you waiting for , exactly ?
i ' m sure you ' ll find someone .
it is good to maintain that contact with people
that is ok sometimes but getting out is important for you too
oh yes , what is the temperature where you are ?
oh ! i love around 70 ! that is perfect . oh it ' s over 80 here , getting a little hot but it will be nice when it ' s night time : ) nothing like a good summer to lift the spirits
that is awesome ! congratulations ! so , you are prepared for everything that is about to happen ?
it sure sounds like you have done everything you can to make the day special !
did you tell his parents ?
that must of been no fun , hopefully he won ' t do it again .
i know , christmas was the best when we were children . now that were adults it ' s not as exciting .
yeah , i used to love waking up in the morning and run downstairs to open my presents .
what is going on ? have you seen the dr ?
i am so sorry you have to worry about that
that is nice . are you planning activities to do with them ?
that is great
which country ?
that ##s cool i bet she will have fun
that is really a bum ##mer . have you looked online for it somewhere else ?
that ’ s no good .
that ' s awesome . how come you guys didn ' t get to see each other often before ?
was it for work , school , etc ?
why did she leave ?
does she have another job already ?
wow that must have been embarrassing .
that is so true !
that sounds really nice ! does it just look better or is travel better ?
that will make getting exercise during or after work a lot easier .
that is a very nice person . you are lucky .
i lost my wallet once but didn ' t find money in it when it was returned to me .
old photos can be so nos ##tal ##gic . do you have a favorite memory ?
adult life can definitely be difficult , but we get a lot of freedom now though .
that ' s amazing ! what are you studying ?
what kind of job are you hoping to get ?
that sounds amazing !
it ' s pretty early to have christmas planned already . i should get on that as well .
when will you find out ?
hopefully you win , what is the prize ?
i used to be , not quite as much anymore
yes my friends play it
oh me too . have you ever messed with them ?
that is great !
where are you going boating ?
what do you like to do on the lake ?
that ##s crazy ! was he ok ?
that ##s great . i love kids
that ##s unfortunate
was it for a contest or a class ?
oh no , must be disappointing . are you putting off making it now or will you go in search for the missing mustard ?
will it taste the same ?
do you like museums ?
same here . neither do i , but there are impressive museums out there that kinda make you change your stance .
i love going to cost ##co .
i always get rice and steak there .
oh , cool ! what kind of turtle was it ?
it sounds like it may have been a box turtle . they are good as pets !
maybe you can have them get you on one of the kidd ##ie ones first ?
hope you have fun !
i always worry about that too . is it early in the morning ?
will you be able to leave a little bit earlier to allow time for any traffic delays ?
are you in your basement ?
that is smart , hopefully thou it doesn ' t happen .
that ##s unfortunate , sucks missing out on time with your family
you definitely gotta appreciate them while you can
that ' s really nice . sometimes things work out ok .
did you just forget your wallet or did you not have any money at all ?
lo ##l a trap for what ?
i guess you ' re not at all attracted to her then ?
aw ##w , i just had to put my dog down last month .
it was very sad and i am sorry you had to go through that ,
that was very nice of him .
how long have you known him ?
oh , are you guys distant ?
i ' m glad you guys can start to come together again .
oh no , why didn ' t they ?
i guess you might have to rec ##ons ##ider this friendship .

i think i wouldn ' t go outside in close to 100 degree weather . that ' s crazy .
that ' s great ! i wish more people would garden , so much health ##ier to grow your own food .
that ' s fabulous . love it when the older generation teaches the younger ones .
that ' s awesome ! you must be feeling more alive and well
it ' s amazing how reaching those kinds of health goals brings things that you would have never even imagined before going through with it
right , you always see the before and after pictures of other people but as you ' re doing it , it seems to take forever
yeah , a lot of the times it would just come back as fast as it got lost
insurance companies suck . i hate dealing with them .
they ' re trying to not pay if they don ' t have too . more $ in their bank .
that is awesome ! i would love to get something like that from a relative ! does it have any sentimental value ?
that was so nice that your were chosen to get it and hopefully pass it on again !

canada is such a beautiful country . was there a lot of things to do there for you kids ?
nice . good luck with that . you are interviewing for which position ?
wow . good luck . i hope you get the position .
that sounds relaxing
what game did you play ?
it is a great feeling when we can say that . my 37th child just became self - sufficient last year as well !
i know ! i think my wife is calling it quit ##s after the 38th , though .
sorry to hear ! what all did you order ? and what was wrong with it ?
cold fries are the * worst * b / c the potatoes are just gross at that point . did you get your money back , at least ?
oh bless your heart ! i ' m sorry to hear ! i ' d have returned it and gotten the whole meal free for the cold messed up fries !
that ' s good ! hopefully you ' ll be compensated in some way for the fries . u ##gh , cold fries ! you ' re way nice ##r about it than i would have been .
nice . what did you buy ?
ah , a must in a household of rug ##rat ##s .

oh my word ! i thought bob ##cats were mythical like unicorn ##s .
wow . was it expensive ?
that ' s crazy !
awesome ! are you excited to go ?
you sound prepared ! i am sure you will make a good impression on the other party go ##ers !
oh wow ! you were pretty angry
i guess you are right
neat ! where are you going ?
sweet ! what are you going to be doing there ? always wanted to take a journey to the south .
oh . wow . did you cry ?
your kid should be on america ' s got talent ! unless you ' re not in america .
what is your new job like ?
that ' s pretty neat ! i work in a nike sweat ##sho ##p in siberia , so i really can ' t say the same !
physics ? that must be crazy hard .
well good luck . i think you ' ll do well if you studied that hard .
all one ? i prefer to be all two in my house .
yeah , being alone a big ole house is often times more sp ##ook ##y than not . i almost got na ##bbed by a ghost the last time i was alone .
u ##gh , that ' s the worst ! bright side - at least you weren ' t far from home that you were able to clean everything up , right ?
* blink ##s * one , i didn ' t know po ##ss ##ums travelled in herds and two , i am only hoping your day didn ' t get worse from there ?
bless it ! and you survived all of that to tell the tale ! and all of this over a busted garbage bag ! we gotta get you a better brand of garbage bags , friend . : )
good job ! how are you doing so far ?
it is tough . don ' t be too hard on yourself . just do better moving forward
that ' s nice
that ' s so true . i was scared to put my kids in day ##care
wow ! they are pretty lucky !
yes that would be nice .
awesome , a bird left the nest . how old is he ?
awe a little sentimental ?
that wonderful ! did he initiate it ?
that ’ s great and a relief
i know the feeling
i definitely know that feeling lo ##l
are you still close ?
that ' s sad . have you reached out to her ?
that ' s not bad . i only see people in my family once ever few years .
oh wow ! cong ##rat ##s ? boy or girl ?
that is great that you are prepared !
it ' s always nice to have some good friends .
i do have a few really good ones .
that sounds exciting ! are you nervous about it ?
it ' s not the easiest thing to do , and so very few states ask for it . the state i come from requires it . it ' s just something you use in so very few situations , i ' m surprised they still test for it .
sounds like a plan ! that ' s the only way you ' ll get better !
are you scared or excited ?
my first few years i went from the east coast to colorado . it will be the best time of your life .
enjoy it before you get old . before you know it college will be over and you will be a slave to student loan payments .
i ' ve been there .
that ' s sweet .
what kind of restaurant ?
man that is pretty crazy being that young even .
me two . no bills and just relax and play .
being stressed never helps .
it could always be worse . people in the 3rd world are on the edge of death from having no food .
what happened ?
it is ok . if the teacher was not angry , it should be fine .
5
we have cold winters but hardly ever any snow . i ' m glad too
did you follow him home and confront him ?
perhaps he thought the same about you ?
how ' d she do ? did she get the right clothes ?
were the three things not in the dress code ?
yi ##iii ##iii ##iii ##ike ##s ! long sleeves in the heat ! * cr ##inge ##s * times like these make me glad our schools went to uniforms ! but i understand about the heat - we ' re in short sleeve ##d polo ##s until november at the earliest .
sounds like what kids would do ! but the bright side is , if you have two days worth of fall or winter , she ' s prepared !
oh no , what was it ? not too bad i hope .
that isn ' t half as bad as what i was thinking it might be . glad to hear it was just over ##ind ##ul ##ging in food . oh well , you always have tomorrow to be better !
what did you do ?
that is awesome . you should marry her again lo ##l
that ' s awesome ! i know that took a lot of hard work !
that ' s the best way to go about it - make sure you have time for all the things you need time for . that way you ' re not running around like a chicken with your head cut off .
are you gonna try to keep that sort of balance going forward ?
are you going to eat them ?
give them to a homeless person .
that is great when that can happen but it doesn ' t always if one or both love a lot ! i hope you remain friends .
i hope so too !
that is terrible . did you lose all the food that was in there or were you able to save it ?
that is so terrible . it would be nice if the refrigerator company had to replace all of your groceries if their product breaks ! did you get a new one yet ?
that ' s awesome . cong ##rat ##ula ##ti ##os
just hope for a happy healthy baby !
congratulations . yes it can be very hard to get pregnant and carry children for some . i know how that goes
i do but both are in heaven . but they are still my children . . doctors / mid ##wi ##ve mistakes on me ( in a lawsuit ) and so it affected the second one . not trying again until i can go to a specialized doctor and get in perfect health .
be very careful . it was just an un ##tre ##ated ut ##i in me and then they wouldn ' t help me when i had hell ##p syndrome for awhile . . i went to a few doctors too . . none were good - and i was full term . . i almost bled out . . the little ##st things sometimes can really hurt you and your baby . i am so sorry ! i am so glad you had 1 , take good care of yourself and follow your gut : )
oh , how adorable ! there are so many bun ##nies around right now . my parents house has especially a lot of them and they don ' t really run off like normal either .
that is so precious . i have never seen that before . baby bun ##nies are the best ! i ' ve had 3 bun ##nies / rabbits in my lifetime and they were great pets . what are your bun ##nies ' names ?
lo ##l , oh no ! my al ##bino rabbit i had when i was younger was like that . . . . ski ##tti ##sh beyond belief ! those are adorable names !
not to me ! some part of me is anxious to be holding a grand ##child , and then when they po ##op or get fuss ##y , to hand them ri ##iii ##iii ##ght back to their parents !
on the one hand i miss them because there ' s nothing in the world like baby smell . on the other , the best day of my life so far was when my youngest was pot ##ty - trained !
a . w ##w that must have been so cute
i ' ve never seen a bunny . that ; s weird
oh no ! that is a hard thing to think about . you might want to take some time apart and find it out to be fair to him
well think about what qualities he has - there are so many dish ##ones ##t people out there and abusive people . sometimes we don ' t connect with someone good . . but will regret it later . definitely think on it as you ' d never want to lose a good trust ##worthy person even if you just keep them as a friend
is that a good or a bad thing ?
aw , i am sorry , they will be back soon though ?
never bad , good mom or dad : ) they are only young once
that makes me mad too
people let things get out of hand and it is so une ##ces ##sar ##y .
uh oh ! was everything ruined ?
oh how disappointing .
that must feel awesome
i feel that way when my kids are gone
i swear , the d ##m ##v is the * worst * !
yeah , but the state would never get out of debt if they had to pay the people for missing work just to wait in in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt lines at the d ##m ##v .
that ' s understand ##able . what happened ?
that ' s hard . are they in a new relationship ? i hope it wasn ' t a bad breakup ?
that ' s hard ! if he was bad to you , i hope you are able to get over it , if not , you can always reach out : )
that sucks
you have to let those people go
lo ##l . that ' s gross
i wouldn ' t either . she should find another job lo ##l
that ' s no good . how did that happen ?
dan ##g . well i bet that really worked to get your point across ha ##ha
oh , wow . that ' s a long time . how old were you when you first went in ?
ha ha . now i know you ' re kidding me . 50 years ? i think you served your time for that offense , wi ##ou ##ld ##n ' t you say ?
south carolina is really nice . what are you planning on doing there ?
sounds like a grand ole time . everyone likes the good ole carriage ride every now and again .
did you get a call back ?
we believe it and you just might
oh dar ##n that is stress ##ful i bet .
that ' s no good . how does that happen ?
i happy you ' re not being abused either .
some people make it to the other side . i ' m glad ou did .
i hear you : ) i do the same
i know right ? i am working on a side business so i can do that one day . you should totally get a side hu ##stle .
i understand ! what are you going to school for ?
i bet , it can help people and pay a lot in a career as well . good luck !
ou ##ch , sounds like you really like working out with your friends .
i ' m no doctor , but it sounds like you might need even more to balance things out .
after being married for that long , i really don ' t blame you . do you want to move on and find someone else ?
well , if that ' s how you feel then maybe it is best if you stay in the dug ##out and don ' t play the field . no shame in that .
did she get into any trouble ?
well that was very nice of her . did you give her anything in return ?
did she get a cute banda ##id ?
that ' s sweet . you should ' ve took a picture and framed it so you guys can cher ##ish that moment forever
i hear ya there . when did you lose her
that is exactly how i would describe my grandma . you are lucky to have had her
that is very nice to friendly ne ##igh ##bo ##ors .
yes , now days , most neighbors don ' t talk to each other .
congratulations ! i ' m sure everything is going to turn out well . you probably have to see your doctor more than usual to make sure everything is okay .
that ' s definitely a good sign !
that sucks . why did he / she do that ?
yeah , ignorance in youthful ##ness is sometimes a good thing . that ' s really terrible of your ex , though . he should be burned at the stake .
i used to think that too . i could sleep if it wasn ' t closed all the way
and you could have caught him in the closet ! ! !
oh wow ! did the guy get caught ?
that would be . i am so sorry you had to go through that .
that sounds like you have some good help now . how old are they ?
its good that they are thoughtful , sound like very well manner ##ed kids ! ! !
what position do you play ?
are you taking some orange slices to spice things up ?
what was holding you back ?
if you could do it all over again , how would you overcome , and pardon me for saying this , your wi ##mp ##y - ness ?
that is awesome . did you find out what it was for ?
that is great
that sounds like a jolly good time , ole cha ##p . what shows / movies are you planning on watching ?
nice . the office is one of my favorite shows . i do enjoy steve carr ##ell ' s character .
aw ##w ##w ##w ##w ! you guys are doing the right thing . how is it doing today ?
that ' s fair enough . i wouldn ' t know what to do with a hurt bird .
that is bad . did you already made reservation and purchase airline tickets ?
good . there was no else that could replace the person sick ?
wow . i bet that was a nice surprise . did you get a lot of presents ?
sounds great . you are lucky to have such thoughtful cow ##or ##kers .
oh wow that is disgusting
what are you going to do ?
where do you guys work ?
that ' s pretty neat . i imagine is very nice working from home . i wish i could so that i can stop working at the nike sweat ##sho ##p .
that ' s a bum ##mer . did you get it repaired ?
well , that ' s good . at least everything turned out okay in the end .
oh wow , i bet that made you smile
that is very awesome
that sounds like a lot of fun . did you ride a lot of rides ?
did you ride any that made you sick ? some of the ones that go upside down always make me sick . ha ##ha .
i bet you were proud
i am sure they learned from you
i am as well . even if it is a simple that ##ched roof .
indeed . the world can use a lot less people .
how come it felt bad ?
that is terrible . why ?
yes , that ##s always a good thing . have you been working long ?
wow . i bet you are grateful to be working . being job ##less is a horrible place to be .
that is no good . how is she doing now ?
that is great to hear
that is horrible ! i would ' ve been too . that actually happened to me but thankfully it was an old account that i didn ' t use . did they take money from you ?
i just think that ' s the worst way for the irs to do things though . life is hard and once you have debt from any numbers of things , it can be hard to climb back out of the red . i ' m so sorry you had that shock and i hope they work with you on payments .
he ' ll have a great time , though . he ' ll make tons of friends and his days will be full of joy ! you will need some ho ##bbies though .
with all the extra time you have you should start a counseling service . i know your mom would use you !
did you have fun
i do love getting gifts
that ' s awesome . are you and your aunt close ?
that ' s cool man . i ' m really not close to any of my relatives .
im sorry to hear that . what made you scared ?
wow ! i bet that is scary . good to know you made it okay .
what did you do ?
what did they advise you to do ?
awesome . are you nervous ?
you definitely will
that ' s really neat . did you guys have an easter egg hunt ?
that ' s cool . who collected the most eggs ?
i understand .
what band was it ?
you need to speak up next time
good , that ##s what needed to happen
how come you were afraid ?
i can understand that
good ##lu ##ck !
ye ##a i think we have all been there
i am sorry , i am sure he will be safe
i am sure you are
four is a pretty cool number . i am a bigger fan of 5 , though .
what was wrong with your dad ?
oh no . i ' m so sorry . i feel you . i lost my sweet springer span ##iel , pepper , not long ago . are you coping okay ?
well , that ' s a wonderful thing . you had a good time with the first one and this new one will breathe life into your day and pull any sadness away . what will you name it ?
it ' s nice to have someone that is helpful around the house . does he work , too ?
well that is too bad . maybe there is some way you can mo ##tiv ##ate him to work harder .
why is that
i hope it turns out well for you !
it is . what are you referring to ?
of course you were
wow . how did you manage to eat that many ? maybe you should have shared .
you should enter a eating contest . sounds like you could win .
that sucks . how does that make you feel ?
yeah , that ' s how it was with my younger brother too . he always go his way .
that ’ s no good . why ?
that would scare me too
why is that
oh sorry to hear that
dan ##g , that sucks . when do you find out if you got the job ?
i think you are over ##rea ##cting . just try to find your medicine and calm yourself down . i am sure you will get the job .
that sounds terrible ! i ' m sorry that happened to you . i hope everything is okay now . do you know what caused it ?
e ##w ##w . . rotten eggs . . that ' s terrible . i know eggs are so healthy for you , but i never touch them partly because of how they smell when they ' re cooked / prepared in certain ways . again , i ' m sorry you had to deal with that . was there anybody nice enough to help you when you were on the bus , or how did that end up ?
that is pretty impressive
that is really something to be proud of
why not just call him ? its not un ##heard of .
maybe he is just busy right now . i wouldn ' t lose hope yet .
that is a good news . did he kept them with him for a long period of time ?
that is nice .
that sucks . what sport ?
you ' re not good at a single one of those ? i was a strong swimmer when i was a kid .
i can understand that
the nic ##u that ##s wonderful
oh fun ! what kind of dog does she have ? what ' s its name ?
my mom had a husky named heidi for almost 16 years . they are beautiful dogs but boy can they run away fast if they get an opportunity .
sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard - - even when you ' ve well out ##gr ##own it . are y ' all far apart in age ?
i love your heart . that ' s important . are you a brother or a sister to them ?
please do . sometimes it takes time to mature on an emotional level . it ' s cool that you have that on them : - )
nice ! where did you meet your date ?
that ' s really cool . where is the date going to be at ?
that is nasty . what are you going to do ?
i am with you
how did that feel ?
that is awesome
that must be hard sometimes , but i guess also has its advantages .
i bet . maybe he will move closer to you soon .
that ' s awesome . what level of math is it ?
i always had trouble with math so anything above counting is beyond what i feel competent in . good luck on the test !
that ' s really cool ! what kind of memories res ##ur ##face ##d ?
oh , i am sorry for being so ins ##ens ##itive . i am sure your mother is in a better place .
wow ! what happened ? i hope everything is okay .

oh cool ! do you play in the game or get to be the cooler part of the team , the water ##boy ?
ha ha ! awesome ! i bet you ' re great at it ! get out a hose and just water them down ! its faster . hope you have a great game tomorrow ! don ' t forget the orange slices .
why are you going to the court ?
i understand . i hope things will go smoothly .
i can understand that
that is good . you will feel better
that is horrible . were you able to do anything about it . ?
i am so sorry to hear that . i wish there was something more you could do .
ir is almost all kid that do that . he will get used to it .
people can be bad some time . i hope it will be better .
what happened
well at least you made it through
oh ye ##a im not surprised though .
ye ##a after the finals , at least he didn ##t go to the gs ##w ha ##ha

that ' s pretty cool . do you think you will get the job ?
that sounds really peaceful
that is so good for the soul
i bet that brought back memories . hopefully good ones .

are you alright ?
i am sorry you have to deal with that .
how did it go ? cong ##rat ##s bt ##w
ha ##h . . it gets better
why did your family leave ? sorry that you felt that way .
what did you do all by yourself ?
oh my god . did you guys have a fight ?
it ' s just an extra tomato , man . you ' re going to let that ruin your relationship with your turtle ?
oh yeah ? what is going to be your hallmark meal ?
can ' t go wrong the su ##shi and steak special . a classic in alaska .
that ' s too bad . why were you all alone ?
interesting . why wouldn ' t they take you along ?
oh wow . . how are you feeling
that ##s good
it was the right thing to do . getting used to not having someone around is going to take some time .
it will take time , but i ' m sure you ' ll be okay .
what a monumental event ! i bet you ' re so excited . what took her away for so long ?
she sounds smart . are you nervous at all or just thrilled to be with her again ?
is the dog pot ##ty trained ?
that pool no ##odle must be terrifying for her .
did your cat show the bird who ' s boss ?
that ' s somewhat offensive .
no i haven ' t . is it good ?
sounds interesting . i will have to check it out .
i will . but i don ##t scare easily .
that ' s so sad . i ' m sorry
have you ever tried writing ? that ' s what i do
you ' re hosting a party ? or attending one ? either way , social gatherings can always be a lot of pressure , so that ' s why i usually avoid them , unfortunately . what are some of your worries , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
oh , so you ' re hosting . man , that ' s definitely hard . i really do feel for you , as i wouldn ' t have the courage to do that . well , since you ' re worried about it , at least it shows you care . and you still have plenty of time to prepare ! do you have anyone that can help ?
that is so sweet !
it is a good sign that she shows that kind of care to them
damn did you do it all alone or you had help ? are you le ##bron james living in a mansion ?
ah that ##s understand ##able
i ' m sorry to hear that ! did you find your dog ?
did you try calling your local shelter ?
oh no . you didn ' t have anyone to go with ?
wow . that ' s some friends you have there .
did everyone end up contributing to the project ?
i am sure they will . they have to if they want to get a good grade .
tornado ##s are terri ##fin ##g . are you ok ?
that ' s good to hear . glad you ' re ok .
lectures can be boring
i do miss some of my class
where you going ?
oh that sounds great . good luck
why did they say no ?
im so sorry . . i wish i could fix that for you .
that sounds like it could be fun , or was it sad ?
oh no ! well those aren ' t such good friends .
that is too bad . why are you on the ke ##to diet ?
yeah , that diet is somewhat expensive . has it been hard sticking to it ?
history is a lot of memo ##riz ##ing . glad you did well .
how were the rest of your exams ?
oh well , there is always next weekend
i am sure you will find something
oh lord , that made me almost vomit ! i choke easy too , i am sorry !
not your fault at all ! something ##s can ' t be helped .
oh i know that feeling . what are some of the things that you can eat ?
it has to be tough to not know what to eat . i hope you ' ll get that all ##ergy test soon to figure things out .
that is really good . starting off right is one of the most important things for a successful school year . where are you going ?
i did attend college , but i am one of those statistics you hear about . . . . a drop ##out .
i ' m sorry to hear that . sometimes kids don ' t know how to interact well with each other . but it ' s an important part of the social ##izing part of life that they work their way through it . all you can do is tell them how to respectful ##ly and appropriately respond and defend themselves .
ah . . so it ' s that kind of situation . yeah , it can be one thing if it ' s just something where kids are acting like kids , and you can ' t physically intervene in time . but it ' s another if you think it ' s neglect and that they ' re not responding appropriately to the situation . i would trust your judgment . i hope everything ends well with it though ! i ' m sure you gave your child lots of love afterward .
it happens even when we study hard sometimes !
true ! life is full of learning , i am glad you have learned something from it , so many don ' t . ku ##dos !
i am sorry , was the cat okay
that does sound scary
good for her . never too late to go back to school .
oh wow . she sounds like super woman !
i don ' t blame you . those things are creepy
i got a clown for my daughters 4 birthday . every single kids cried lo ##l
i understand that , i am not either with some of my family ! we are not always born in too families that are like us ,
i am sorry , are they very mean or abusive ?
well then it ' s no loss ! find family in others . that is no family !
cat room ? i ' ve never heard of such a thing .
did any of the cats get out ?
maybe you should get cameras
wow that ##s great
every few years . . and its enough !
yeah , that ' s never something to complain about - - well , unless you were fired , i guess , but that doesn ' t sound like that was the case ! i ' m happy for you , too . did you do anything fun with your extra time ?
well , that was nice of you . i ' m glad you got a chance to squeeze in more family time and didn ' t go spend it just sitting around or something . i hope that happens more often for you .
fun ! those can be addict ##ive for me . i only get them around christmas time . . . not sure why but its a fun stock ##ing stuff ##er . did you win ?
i hope you win too ! scratch them now and let me know if you win . now i ' m excited for you ! hope you hit a big bank !
oh wow . . are you going there to surprise her
well don ' t worry too much . . . the food isn ##t the most important thing and i am sure it will at least be satisfactory . focus on the family
that is not good . so no way to get the info back
i am sorry , that sounds terrible
does your dad still live nearby ?
i am so sorry to hear that . his memory lives on though .
oh gross ! what restaurant ?
i would blast them on social media . that is not good , especially for them not to take responsibility for it .
ye ##a . floors get dirty pretty quickly with dust . will you be replacing the vacuum ?
i actually got a vacuum myself but made a bad decision . the thing does not suck well .
what breed is it ?
i love boxers , and their cut off tails .
wow . i hope it was a clean dia ##per .
who knew a dia ##per would be so terrifying .
that sounds like so much fun . i hope you have a good , relaxing time . where are you going ?
i hope it ' s a better experience by the pier than mine . ha ##ha ##ha ##ha .
that ' s good . are you getting the hang of it ?
it ' s better to write things down than try to keep things in your head .
that sucks . what store is it ?
we have a lot of those where i live .
nice ! is this your first time having that done ?
how come , what happened ?
oh gee ##z ! lo ##l ! just watch tv online : ) i do - that way always something i like , i can watch
i love cheese ##cake
oh no ! was is plain or did it have sweet topping ##s too ?
i wish i could make a che ##es ##cake .
what stores are you going to
news clothes are always nice
oh my go ##sh ! i am glad you are ok ! ! !
where do you live ? kansas ?
oh dogs are so sweet . was it your first time ?
he lived ? oh no . what happened ? !
what did you do
good luck next time !
that ' s amazing , first child ?
cher ##ish every moment , they grow up so fast !
isn ' t that the best feeling when something you really want is actually on deep discount , and you are just in the right place at the right time !
i am right there with you . i hope this is a sign of a great week to come !
i ' m glad they won !
were the opposing team a really tough one ?
oh i bet you enjoyed that
i bet you will
i am sorry , why didn ' t he come ?
i bet he hated missing it too ! work is good for bills but it interfere ##s a lot with life
that is not good . i am glad they are okay though
i would be too
you seem a bit jealous .
you should talk to your friend about it .
how precious ! how old is she now ? what does the or ##name ##nt look like ?
what a wonderful nos ##tal ##gic piece . my daughter is 8 and growing up way too fast . i have a hand print or ##name ##nt she made and i can ' t believe one day she ' ll be 13 !
that ' s awesome . what subject was it ?
history is one my favorites as well !
that ##s bad timing for sure
well at least they got out
you are a good parent . how do you have space for it all ?
i guess you ' ll have to get a storage unit . the question then is what goes in the storage unit ? furniture or the kids crafts . ha ##ha .
that ##s always a plus
that happens to me too . i go to the store almost every day
does he live far away ?
that makes sense . did you have fun ?
what movie is it
well as long as they love it
that sounds amazing ! what do you have planned ?
that sounds great !
that ' s so neat when friendships last so long .
i am sure you guys have a great bond and many fun memories .
no one came to take care of you ?
was the cat nice ? i know they can be sas ##sy when they don ' t get all of the attention lo ##l
healthy is important
i guess , but they can always teach them
oh wow , you must have been thrilled !
that ' s great when someone you love puts in the extra effort to be there for you
that ##s not good , i remember bad times at school . what happened ?
one good friend who you can trust is better than a bunch you can ' t . it ' s just part of growing up sometimes . school can be an exercise in mental strength .
yes , i hope she can find her self worth in who she is . it ' s just part of growing up . it ' s hard
what kind of birds are they ?
that ##s so sweet of you .
that can be one of the hardest parts of life . very tough
how did it go ? is it college ?
i am sorry , roommate ##s can be annoying sometimes
i will not either
ah ! that ' s kind of a scary thought , but i bet that would also be kind of fun . i live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in " haunted " trips and stuff like that , so i have seen them around and have wondered about going on one . do you believe in ghosts ?
yeah , i can totally understand that . it can be ex ##hila ##rating and a different experience , i would imagine . but i would understand that you wouldn ' t want to have to deal with the after effects . i never have trouble with nightmares , so i don ' t worry about that . as for me , i ' m still on the fence about ghosts .
that ' s really too bad . i know how that feels . have you tried telling her how you feel about it ?
that must be really difficult and lonely for you . i hope you guys can get something figured out .
sounds like a good kid . what has he been working on .
that ' s great ! how old is he ?
that is nice of you . where has he been ?
that is really nice of you
sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself .
if they know you , they should know better .
talk about an un ##we ##lco ##me guest ! i would have immediately slammed my door shut ! i never know how to respond in those situations , as in whether or not they ' re dangerous , etc . what did you do ?
i did not expect that kind of reaction ! but i guess i don ' t know enough about po ##ss ##ums . maybe that makes sense . i compare them almost to ra ##cco ##ons , who i ' ve seen be very aggressive . well , it looks you made a new friend . i hope you named them !
you are so lucky !
i know exactly what you mean . someone returned my purse at the casino once . it still had my money in it !
that must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with . to constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support , and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head . you have to be really res ##ili ##ent to go through that .
wow . . that ' s almost noble . i hope you ' re able to still properly survive without it , especially since it ' s unfair that you ' re not getting it in the first place . i ' m sorry you ' re being put in that position . one day i ' m sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them .
don ' t be too hard on yourself . you taught yourself a lesson for next time .
i ' m in college i understand . just have to keep pushing forward and you ' ll so great
oh no . i have experienced that before and its not pleasant . its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you ' re near a s ##nob .
seriously ! i just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn ' t always means they are better than me just because they are entitled . as they say , everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time .
u ##gh ! so you have corrupt police officers in your town too ? that is a bum ##mer !
i would too ! most officers don ##t show up for that .
your mom is awesome
maybe you should go on a trip together
oh yeah ? that sounds awesome . that ' s how it should be ! can you tell me a little bit about them ?
ha ##ha , that ' s incredible . a lot of parents wouldn ' t feel that way . . . after 18 , they ' re done . that ' s pretty cool of you to feel that way , but i guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are . it sounds like you raised them right .
why is that ?
i can understand that
i hop ##s so too ! work does come first or the bills can ' t be paid ! : )
what kind of birthday are you having ?
wow ! enjoy it ! what did you accomplish if i may ask ?
that is something that is a dream ! enjoy it so much ! cong ##rat ##s
i am so sorry to hear that . when will you see them again ?
that is so sad to hear . i hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon .
there ' s absolutely nothing i can say to make you feel better about that . i ' m sorry for your great losses . just from those few sentences alone , i can tell you were very passionate about them . what were their names , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
those are great names ! and that does sound like a good idea , as long as you ' re comfortable with it . it ' s such a ten ##uous situation . . to want another pet to fill the void , but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don ' t live up to their predecessors . my girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes . she ' s already getting nervous since her dog is 10 - years - old .
oh gross ! i ' ve heard of flies or ants being in an ear , but a roach ? that gives me chill ##s because i hate roach ##es soo ##oo ##o much . now i might have nightmares tonight !
e ##w ! i might start sleeping with ear plug ##s in now too . i ' ve heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime , some in your sleep . so many things to be scared of with bugs ! i ' m so glad they were able to get it out . tell her i hope she gets over the trauma of it okay .
oh , how come ?
oh my god ! i have done something similar before . i don ' t get embarrassed easy but i know such things do sting a bit !
that is terrible
police here do that sometimes . it sucks .
i can imagine that . i ' ve never lived alone before .
when did you start living by yourself ?
that is great ! being without a job can be very scary
what kind of job is it ?
yu should report him
well that ##s what i mean . i hate when people take advantage of others
oh that could be tough sometimes . i ' m glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted .
it ' s all behind you now .
my neighbors are terrible so i hope you have a good relationship
i actually had some move in a couple of days ago . i have figured them out yet lo ##l
that is doing something . it ' s what we call relaxing .
have you been busy lately ?
that happens over time
i wonder what my old school looks like now
oh no , what happened ?
you should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity .
that ' s terrible , what did you do ?
i hope he learned his lesson .
how was it ?
what did you order ?
yes ! yin and yang , it ' s hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud : )
remember to cher ##ish them as we can all go at any minute : )
oh , i love cleaning , so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed . what kind of brand ?
a hoover seems like a reliable choice . my girlfriend is a neat freak , and decided to go with a big purchase , a d ##yson , which is more expensive . i ' ve used it and it ' s not bad . still not sure i ' d pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner , but who am i to argue . anyway , i ' m happy for you .
wo ##ah ! i ' m soo ##oo glad you ' re okay ! those big rig ##s are so dangerous and make me so nervous . i stay as far away from them as i can .
well , that ' s understand ##able . i ' ve had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car . was she in shock when you guys were almost hit ?
i completely understand that . things are always scary when it is happening to your kids , but there is hope ! have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet ? or doctor fu ##hr ##man , or doctor michael greg ##er ? i think it could heal your son !
you will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office , but it can heal almost anything ! i hope your son is better before the end of summer . keep hope alive !
what happened to it ?
that sucks .
what are they doing ?
oh lo ##l , well it
sorry ! i meant that kids do that , enjoy it mom while they are little : )
i feel so ##rr for the poor guy !
ye ##a , they ' re his parents . i can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child .
that ' s nice of you to say about someone else . it ' s nice when someone can recognize someone else ' s hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed . i ' m sure he knows how proud of him you are .
that ' s a good way to look at it , to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for . are you in school yourself , or just working ?
o ##ops . that ' s doesn ' t have to be a bad thing . no one can resist fries from mcdonald ##s . how did she react ?
well , there you go . she enjoyed it and if she didn ' t complain or sc ##off at you , then she sounds like a keeper !
you must really miss him ! so glad you ' ll finally be reunited with him .
oh you have kids , too ? they ' re going to be so happy !
i ' ve never done that before .
i bet its fun . i can ##t swim though
it ? haven ' t heard of it . what ' s it about ?
are you thinking about telling her you don ' t want to see it ?
that ' s a great idea ! for what cause though ?
that is very thoughtful of you .
oh no . that has happened to us so many times . i thought fi ##dh were easy
wow . im sorry
people can be inc ##ons ##ider ##ate sometimes . i hope you don ' t get sick !
that ' s true . it ' s nice of you to put yourself in their shoes .
oh man , cost ##co pizza is great , and so cheap , too . it may not be the best , but for the price and quantity , you can ' t really beat it . do you like shopping at cost ##co often ?
yeah , i guess it depends on your household . i just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk . but i think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership . still , i really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole .
that was so nice of you . what did they need to use it for ? were you able to live without it ?
what ? ! ! that ' s terrible . i don ' t understand how people don ' t take care of things that don ' t belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things .
that is terrible . some people ar just no good .
i hate that happened to you . i know the feeling too . someone stole my car from the work parking lot once . i had just so ##ent over 1500 getting things fixed on it .
family conflict is always hard . maybe you don ' t need to take a side and try to work for peace .
it is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations . this might be a situation that calls for some professional help .
whoa ! was that a good surprise , or a bad surprise ? i could see that going either way , but at least it would be exciting ! i had that happen when i got one for christmas . well , actually it was in my parent ' s bed , and i barge ##d into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents , and i saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with .
that ' s pretty cool ! i hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it . your wife sounds really cool to do that for you .
did you call her ? i hope she ' s ok !
i ' m glad you ' re going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it .
oh , that ' s kind of nice . it ' s nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live , so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace . i ' ve lived near the ocean all my life , and while i do take it for granted from time to time , i try to remember how useful and beautiful it is .
sometimes it means increased work com ##mute , or higher costs of living . but sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it . it ' s all a balance . i ' m glad you seem to have found yours !
that is awesome !
it will save you a lot of money too
oh nice . what will you be bing ##e watching ?
hope you find something you like .
she will do great . or she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful
lids today are so pick ##y about everything . its sort of strange . its nothing like when i was growing up
that ' s terrible . sometimes it ' s hard to know who your real friends are , and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them , only to have them bail on you , to realize that you ' re not valued by them . i say cut your ties sooner rather than later . life ' s too short .
oh man . . . when you consider all that , then yeah , definitely cut ties . if they did that to me more than twice , then i would realize really quick that they weren ' t the type to depend on or waste time on . i feel sorry for you . people should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship . go out and find you someone who will .
wow , that sounds exciting !
i love a good rock concert !
oh god . someone did pick up their dog ' s po ##op , hu ?
it must ' ve been . i hope that never happens to you again .
i bet it did .
not too many of those around nowadays
oh that was good of you .
oh ha ##ha i know that feeling .
that ##s a good idea .
that ##s a bum ##mer
who ##s concert ?
nice . are you excited ?
i hope it ' s what you expected to be !
that is so sweet of your cat .
well , i hope you get better soon .
oh sweet . sin city ! what do you look forward to doing ?
oh ye ##a . i heard the buffet ##s there are amazing .
good for you . you are an example ##r brother .
that is so hard to imagine . she will need all the help she can get from you .
that is great to hear . anything in particular ?
ct ##hat sounds amazing !
oh god that ' s terrifying ha ##ha . i hate snakes .
i know what you mean , they are cool to look at but if they are near me it sp ##ook ##s me hard .
that ' s tough . i have two older brothers , so i know how that is . we ' re separated by four and eight years , respectively , so we weren ' t as close as you two seem to be , but i always liked having them around .
well , absence always does make the heart grow fond ##er . it will make your relationship a little strained , but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more . hopefully his college work doesn ' t stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out .
your husband sounds awesome . that ' s interesting that you ' re the type of person that actually likes birthday parties . most people i know would be too embarrassed or self - conscious to enjoy them , and they ' d feel uncomfortable . especially me . but for you , i ' m glad you can get into them .
oh , i didn ' t mean anything about the age ! who cares about that . i ' m just a doo ##fus when it comes to social interaction , so i get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me . but i hope you have a lot of fun , especially since your husband went through so much effort . i bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great .
oh no ! my gut feels sick for you having to go through that . it happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward . how did the neighbors take it ?
its so com ##men ##dable that you went over and told them right away . not everyone would do that . your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people .
that is cool . when did you learn ?
that is awesome
oh that ' s rare . how come ?
oh now i see lo ##l . who ' s your favorite team ?
oh wow , that ' s nice of you ! what kind ?
i love bmw ##s . they must ' ve been so happy !
i ' m so sorry . are you okay ?
oh goodness , you will find someone better .
are you exited about it . do you play the piano .
well , there is your chance
oh ye ##a ? what ' s happening this weekend ?
that ' s awesome . how long are you guys going to be there ?
that sucks . did you get a rain ##che ##ck on your birthday though ?
i ' m glad they did that for you . so it wasn ' t all that bad having to work on your birthday then .
uh oh . was someone in there ?
oh wow ! that is kind of scary .
that ' s good to have land you own .
privacy is so important to have sometimes .
that isn ' t cool . is there anyone else that sells it ?
that is good
that ' s great . what is the good news ?
i am very happy for you !
oh me too ! i heard it will be the last one .
me too ! i hope we both enjoy it a lot !
good for you . i always had communication problems with my parents
yes , you should , you are very lucky .
you and me both my friend
i know it is so disturbing
that is great , how long has it been since ?
well i hope you have fun !
that ’ s awesome ! is she a good one ?
i am really glad to hear that .
that was nice . i just rec ##en ##lt had a baby . it was amazing !
thanks ! what band did ya ##ll see ?
that ' s interesting . what makes you confident ?
ah i see . that would be a good guess then .
is there a reason . are you expecting bad news ?
i am sure you are prepared for this interview .
what did you see ?
wow ! that is a miracle !
good luck in your camping . i hope you have a lot of fun .
you are going to ace that interview
what are you planning ?
that sounds really fun . hopefully you have some help .
what do you think ?
i can understand that
why ? what did they do ?
i understand your frustration .
really ? ? you probably were been very scared .
what kind of ghost it was ?
inclined to do what ?
that is cool . how did you do ?
yes ! sometimes i like such gatherings
ha ha ha . yes indeed !
why would they do that ?
man did you say anything ?
that was really sweet of him !
i am very happy for you !
why is that ?
oh that ' s so bad . but , at least you realized your mistake . you are a good person .
yes , i did . i t was a great game .
are you kidding ? ? they were the favorites all the way .
what are you afraid of ?
wow , that sounds terrible .
are you happy for him or jealous ?
well , if he really is your friend you shouldn ' t .
oh ##h ! why ?
yes ! that ' s very bad . i don ' t like it either
did you miss someone or a place maybe . ?
i am sorry to hear that . i am sure he is in a better place .
what is the reason ? did he get a great job offer ?
families move all the time . the kids will be fine .
what did she do ?
oh wow ! that is very impressive !
i ' m sorry to hear that . will you dog be okay ?
i wish only the best for him .
i love scary movies . what was it ? was it good ?
that ’ s fun though
oh wow i hope it went well for him that takes a lot of courage .
that is really great .
wow , that is really gross .
i can sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with you .
congratulations . you must be very proud of her .
i am sure she will graduate with honors and get a great job
that is not good . what seems to be the cause ?
i am so sorry . that must be very difficult .
oh really ? why would you be scared ?
i see . a war would be horrible .
i am sorry to hear that . what is the reason for this ?
i am sorry to hear that . do you have full cover insurance .
that really sucks , i don ##t know the feeling tho .
she sounds like a rude person .
oh that ' s cool , how long did the graduation last ?
that ' s a little annoying , since you just have to sit there and wait for it to end ha ##ha .
that is cool , sounds like a good time .
i totally agree with you . he ' s great !
i can not disagree with you .
i am sorry to hear that . we you expecting so ##mt ##hing very expensive ?
did you get in touch with the postal office ?
oh that ##s a weird thing to say .
saying you are scary is weird tho ? ? ?
i am sorry to hear that . following a diet is very st ##res ##ff ##ull .
you probably need to get more motivated .
i ' m so sorry . will you be okay ?
i hope you will feel better .
what show is that ?
do you watch any other shows ?
will you be hosting a thanksgiving party at your home ?
does your mother ' s house have any animals ?
when did you find out ?
i guess she didn ' t get a cat then .
it is good to stay informed .
i am glad people still pay attention to the outside world .
that is very bad , you should return it .
when did you do it ?
that ' s good . what kind of parade was it ?
oh my go ##sh ! i would have been so mad . did you call them and complain ? they need to fix it .
that is a good thing . i am sure you are a great mom .
i do have kids . being a mom can be hard , but it is so reward ##ing .
that ' s a shame , you shouldn ' t have to do that .
things will get better soon .
did you call the manager and complain ?
you should of called and told them .
i ' m sorry , how do you feel ?
i hope you can forgive yourself .
do you talk softly ?
you should tell them .
it is great to have a brother you can count .
i am sure he can also count on you for everything
how long have you been married ?
do you have any children ?
i am sure you looked just fine .
i am sure it was not that bad .
did you take the offer ?
that was nice of him .
oh no that is horrible . is he okay ?
i hope he can do so quickly !
why do you feel at peace ?
what did you do with them ?
wow that ##s crazy .
i bet it was with something like that .
i am so happy for you !
did you go on any rides ?
i think he is doing a great job .
no , i am well educated . he lowered taxes .
really ? . you are a loser
you should better yourself and fix this situation .
that is very nice of her .
that ' s nice you can rely on her .
that wasn ' t very nice .
you should return it .
oh wow , that ' s exciting !
i ' m also going to college in the fall , but i ' m gonna be a sophomore .
how did she dump you ?
will you still be friends with her ?
oh wow that is awesome .
ye ##a i bet it does .
did she not get it ?
will she apply elsewhere ?
it is unacceptable for a friendship . i think you should not behave in such a way ever again
you should . you must immediately let your friend know and apologize for your behavior
that is a very nice gesture by them .
you must have some great people in your life .
what did you do ?
you should sue them .
oh no , what did you steal ?
that is not right . do you feel bad ?
really ? that ' s amazing , what words ?
that ' s really exciting , i ' m happy for you .
did you hurt yourself ?
did they laugh at you ?
oh that ##s so cool .
i bet you were so happy .
that was smart of you .
you would be a good planner .
did you do it in person ?
you should of done it in person .
don ' t worry , you will be fine .
just have faith and everything will work out .
that is good that you are happy about his efforts .
i guess it depends on what the next couple of years hold .
that is nice of them .
you are well prepared .
that ' s good . anything special happening ?
ah , so you feel confident about it ?
when is she coming ?
how long is she staying ?
i ' ve never had to do it before , have you ?
i ' m sure it was , i hope the next time isn ' t as bad for you .
did you expect it ?
there are other girls out there .
how did you do ?
when do you get the grade ?
i ' m sorry , why did you get fired ?
things will work out if you stay positive .
do you live in a place where it regularly rains ?
as it is summer , i was a bit surprised to see raining in your place
oh my go ##sh i completely agree on the loneliness thing
i don ##t to be honest just try to get through the day but iv ##e never been in a relationship so it gets bad
oh my , was it worth it ?
what a joke ! are you going to sue ?
how did that happen ?
that ' s okay , she will forgive you .
what did you do with it ?
what did you spend it on ?
i have never played that game .
how old are you
oh damn , you had cancer before ?
i ' m sure it was , hopefully it ' s gone for good .
oh ye ##a im the same , gonna be wild .
oh that ##s awesome , you are a good person , we need more boo ##ze people
did you watch tv ?
what do you watch on netflix ?
i love it too ! it ' s really fancy .
i know right ! it ' s weird how it ' s faster than a gasoline car .
did you run away ?
did you kill it ?
is this your first home ?
how big is the house ?
good for you . many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments
you should be grateful for having such a caring father
i hope you do too !
hard work always pays off .
that was nice of him .
will he let you drive it ?
that is so sweet of you > i am sure that makes her so happy .
you are making memories that will last a lifetime .

that sounds like you were confident in your decision . did you think it through ?
that sounds like you were happy with the decision that you made .
why your parents ? can ' t you buy it yourself , all on your own like a grown ups ?
i am sorry to hear that . i think you should join your parents when they go shopping for a pet to a store
i really love those types of shows . remember what it was called ?
oh cool , i ' ve never watched that one before !
physics is an interesting subject , but it can get difficult to understand sometimes .
hopefully you won ' t have to take an additional physics course in the future !
well that ' s not very nice ! why ' d you do that ? !
i would sure hope so ! that poor kid .
that sounds like a fun project !
patience is always a good thing .

fantastic , i imagine you must be so proud .
oh that really suck ##ks .
i see what you mean i would be too
that sounds like a fun night .
i am happy for you .
did he get you ?
they do look a little scary !
oh that ##s great , good work .
oh ye ##a i work out a lot and im no where close so you must work hard
did you do it on purpose ?
you ' ve got to be careful , that can cause a very serious accident !
really ? lo ##l
it will be
are you okay ?
i ' m glad you didn ' t get hurt .
oh no . are you at an elevated area ?
always good to be prepared
cong ##rat ##s ! that is a good feeling .
your hard work is paying off ! keep it up .
i ' m afraid of public speaking or performing in crowds , so that takes courage ! how did it go ?
that ' s great ! you have to keep a good attitude about it . i hope you get the part you want !
can you even find one like that now ?
definitely good old days !
that ' s really impressive ! education is really important .
that ' s cool . it ' s good to be supportive of your friends .
that ##s scary , i hate that stuff .
ha ##ha that ##s quite funny
i am sure it does . it is same for me . i was also raised in the 90s .
yes it was . i miss that time in my life .
that sounds amazing ! i love it when families adopt and give a loving child a home .
that ' s so sweet ! ! i see you said she was a baby , but how old is she currently ?
oh cool ! what part of texas were you going to check out ?
yes , the beaches there would be really fun to go explore . plus lots of sight seeing !
that ##s horrible so sad : /
i bet it is , so sad .
that ##s nice of you but so hard to deal with
that ' s good to hear he ' s doing so well . did you have a lot of input ?
teachers ? well it ' s not always the case . i never let school interfere with my education
is there something specific that you are scared about ?
slow down . do not jump into such conclusions so fast . i highly recommend you to immediately reach out to a doctor
really . did anybody get hurt .
do you have full cover on you car ?
so sorry to hear that . it ' s not easy
well done . i ' m sure she ' ll appreciate it
that does sound boring because you had no one to interact with , but at least you had some privacy .
i see . it would be quite lonely without a roommate to share the experience with .
that ##s so nice of you .
i bet it is .
i have never had an accident . been driving for 22 years now
trash cans ? how odd . maybe you should complain to the city
maybe it is your imagination . the were probably catching up .
you should not be so ins ##ecure about your partner . it is not healthy .
it seems under trump , the economy is booming as he promised
indeed . many thought that way , but he actually delivered on his promises
that is sad . did he pass away ?
i bet it does . i am so sorry . try to think of all the good times with him .
did she . how did it go ?
congratulations . you probably are very proud of her .
me either , they have done so much for me in my life .
wow , that ##s so nice . there are al ##ot of people in life who have no one .
yes there are . it is so sad .
it is difficult when we all have busy lives and limited resources .
oh no . how many people do you think noticed ?
funny how nobody told you about it
i bet that is really enjoyable . are you going anywhere fun ?
have fun ! that sounds like a great time .
oh , that sounds rough . were you successful ?
that ' s great ! i ' m happy for you . i hope you get along real well
sounds rough . did it do any major damage ?
good ! i ' m glad it worked out for you guys at least
you must have been over ##joy ##ed . i know what he meant to you .
be sure and put it in a safe place .
well that ' s not right no matter what your excuse because now you ' re not trust ##worthy see
it ' s better to end things than to wait for years . don ' t waste any more time like i did . 4 years
that ' s always good to hear . what ' s going on ?
that sounds like a fun time ! enjoy !
that sounds like it is exciting but also a lot of work .
wow how kind of her ! you are lucky to have such a good mom .
wow , and did you ever end up finishing the project ?
i see , what did you do instead
really ?
sometimes i do
i ' m not sure what you mean , but di ##s ##nta ##nce does tend to make things more difficult
that ' s hard , but he will be back ! try to take your mind off him by doing some fun activities
that ' s horrible ! this is why they say never a lend ##er nor a borrow ##er be . .
i hope it wasn ' t a lot of money . sometimes it takes a hard lesson to learn whom to let in your life .
sorry to hear . will you be planning anything special ?
if you have other family member around you , ask around and get everyone involved . it should be nice .
i bet that was a nice surprise .
that is so cool .
wow , how are you adjusting ?
have you tried to go out and make friends ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i love my dog
he can live on in memories perhaps
who did ?
did you like what she bought ?
really ? that is a crazy thing to do
did anything happen to him ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . did you have the files backed up at all ?
wow , that ' s so lucky ! i should do that as well just in case !
aw , that ' s adorable ! i bet he ' s the cute ##st thing
that ' s awesome . i want a baby nephew : (
i can understand your feelings . that ' s a tough situation .
that is good that you trust him , but temptation is never good for anyone .
that ' s really tough . but one closed door leads to the next great opportunity .
that ' s horrible ! if you don ' t have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case . report it to the police so it is documented and justice will pre ##va ##il . you don ' t deserve or need to put up with that .
what a nice gift ! my little brother did the same for me actually . xbox one s last year
oh yes . got like 400 games on it .
knew who , exactly ?
someone randomly walked up to you and kissed you ? that ' s odd
really ? why did you do that ?
ok
when will she be returning ?
how are you keeping yourself occupied ?
wow that sounds like a lot of fun !
what was your favorite part of the trip ?
oh yeah ? what is it ?
oh my days lo ##l . that ' s a classic . i like 2 stupid dogs myself
has she taught him to sit ?
wow she must be a really good dog owner , is this her first ?
that had to make you feel good . it is so easy to forget when your trying so hard to remember . lo ##l
i always make a list before a trip and triple check it before i leave .
that ' s terrible ! how did you find out ?
it ' s hard to find forgiveness for something like that . still it ' s better that he confessed than you having to find out otherwise . if only a little better /
cong ##rat ##ulation . how it went ?
that is very nice . cong ##rat ##ulation .
oh no ! i hate that happened and i bet it was scary because it looked like someone broke in . but now you have a repair bill . sorry that happened to you .
i hope the person ' s conscience makes them feel guilty and they come clean about the situation ! and hopefully rei ##mb ##urse you !
sounds like fun . what you got planned ?
got any family out there ? cousins perhaps
what kind is it , cuban ?
cool , i like those , but they are crazy expensive , if you want a thick one .
why you don ' t invite a friend to come with you ?
why don ' t you take a guide or a book to help visit ?
oh no i am so sorry . did you have flood insurance at least ?
did you lose anything you can ' t replace ? important documents or pictures ? must be some bright light .
i bet , sounds like it would be nice .
ye ##a but exams can still really suck ##k
movies can be emotional , do you remember the film ?
that ' s a good movie . yes , time really goes by fast and those memories remind us of the good times .
what was it about ?
did succeed at anything ?
wow that ' s so cool ! which comics were they ?
oh yeah that would be such a fun find !
sweet , where about ##s are you going ?
no doubt , do you have a tour guide or is it just free for you to roam about ?
what about 5 ?
i still have no idea what do you mean ?
oh god , that ' s awful ! is she alright ?
that would make sense , assuming she is getting pretty old .
oh no , did she say something really upset ##ting ?
oh that ' s the worst . . . i wish people would just say what they want to say
oh do you have summer classes ?
eh its not bad , its quite productive
man that sounds like the dream . watching anything good ?
the british version of the u . s . version ?
not my pick but i am glad you get a laugh out of it .
oh my go ##sh . why did your pants fall ?
were you able to laugh it off or were you so mort ##ified you wanted to crawl out of the room ?
i understand . were you able to manage the situation ?
it is ok . it was a scary situation .
what kind of problems ?
do you have enough time for it ?
why , what did he tell you ?
she must really be a good friend , how are you repay ##ing here ?
is it a type of work you ' ve been wanting to get into for a while ?
wow , engineering , sounds impressive . i ' m sure the income will be awesome .
that sounds great ! what are you growing ?
that sounds delicious and healthy also .
it ' s nice to be able to look back . it can really give you perspective on your life now .
that is so true . after all we can ' t change the past only learn from it .
why would they do such a thing ?
that is so bad , the police should be called for that .
i understand .
those kind of thing happened from time to time .
oh ye ##a i know the feeling
o ##of that ##s harsh i feel for you
ye ##a its insane that he ##s a political figure
ye ##a and im ##mi ##gara ##nts
that is disgusting , what did you do to clean it ?
did the smell went away ?
family members are awesome , what was the situation ?
i am glad everything turned out alright !
i bet you are happy as never before .
you are lucky that your girlfriend is a gamer .
good for them for taking the initiative and helping the family .
you must of done something right in raising them .
why would you do such a thing ? !
that is unacceptable , find a job !
that ' s great . what made you feel that .
that ' s a great feeling , i don ' t like having any kind of bill anyway .
did you got the grade ?
that is nice . cong ##rat ##ulation .
that ##s horrible
oh that ##s nice
that is great ! what actor is it ?
that sounds like a great time . i hope you have fun .
that ' s cool what was it a about

what was a joy ?
i see , you must have felt very happy about it !
wow , you must have been pretty confident then .
i hope you did your best and got the grade you wanted .
oh that ##s good why is that
that ##s wonderful
glad to hear you made it through . what caused the accident ?
drunk drivers are the worst . i am always on the look out for them because . i ' d be thanking god too if i was in your shoes .

sorry what did you do the next day
it doesn ##t happen often as i am a supervisor at work
ye ##a i would too
that is such good news . what did you get ?
wonderful choice . those are very depend ##able and fun to drive .
when i was younger i lived in an apartment by myself . i missed having family around .
i wanted to be on my own but i just didn ' t realize how it would be by myself .
oh no ! you should never lash out on people while drunk , the worst of things can happen under the influence .
i think the best thing to do is talk to her and apologize . if you admit to you being foolish she may find it to forgive you .
were you as freaked out as i would have been ?
what did he do with it ?
it is good to reflect every now and then . do you have any regrets ?
that ##s nice , i took feel emotional when thinking about the old days .
i ' m sure you were worried sick . did you find it ?
is there anything i can do to help find it ?
that sucks
that ##s understand ##lb ##le
wow where were you going
o ##oh i guess you were afraid
i feel ashamed of myself , what about you ?
you should never think that way . failure is a part of life .
why were mad ? where did the dog go ?
maybe he / she had a significant other . dogs need love too .
oh no , what happened ? did the invitations not get out or were people busy ?
that is so weird , maybe try contact ##ing them and see what happened . sorry to hear .
oh no . did it run off or stay close by ?
hopefully he didn ' t get hurt . it might be time to put a lock on the gate .
who saved you ?
well that was ob ##ser ##vant of her . . sometimes people don ##t even notice
i bet you were happy
that is always nice

i would have to loved to see that bt ##w ! do you dance with friends or alone ?
i can understand that . you are more passionate than others

i guess you can just start trying to save for it . don ' t be jealous or it will eat you up inside !
i understand how you feel . i wonder how those people afford it .
i ' m sure if you work hard you could afford it too .
oh no . . what happened ?

oh shoot . . i wish you get to go soon enough buddy
oh cool buddy . . how much did you win ?
alright , anyway ##s good for you !
no , i missed it , but i do usually watch ufc fights ! were there quick knock outs ?
knock outs are the best ! when was ufc established ? i feel like it was been around for a while !
that is insane . you might want to take it elsewhere .
the prices have risen al ##ot with all the technology and electrical components .
oh no . i can ' t imagine not having ac in this heat .
i hope you can get it fixed easily . i know they are not cheap to replace .
good reason to be scared . what steps are you both taking to increase security ?
a good sound plan . you ' re right it is a father ' s responsibility to protect his family .
i found a bunch of dead mice few days ago
ha ##ha . . that ##s a really funny story !
that sounds like a nice plan . do you often get the chance to take days off ?
i ' ve been thinking of forcing myself to take time off . we all need a break from time to time .
friends and ufc sounds like a great night ! i missed the fight . were there any good knock outs ?
awesome ! was that who you were hoping would win ?
i hope you get it too ! best of luck ! we all could use extra money in the pocket !

what happened ?
oh no : ( it happens though , it wasn ' t your fault !
tell me about it ! my phone keeps freezing and it ' s so slow .
it is frustrating ! especially when you need to call someone or text someone quickly and you need to wait for your phone to start working
i can relate . i have a colleague that seems better at everything than me and is now supervisor . just don ' t let jealousy take over your life . that will only hurt you .
just focus on what you do have , which i ' m positive is a lot going for you ! you can also develop so many more good skills with focus and determination . just give it time and the hard work you ' re already doing .
they went into your yard to take the tree out ? ? is that even legal ?

oh no . . i hope you were not hurt
no actually , i always wanted to though
i feel you buddy . . family is above everything
very true , family is always a sense of support
don ' t feel sad , day will pass and present is the best moment and live
be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies
that ##s a good person to have around it appears
nah i am a supervisor so we really can ##t discuss anything going on with them
oh man : ( i hate when it happens ! did you have to go home ?
sorry to hear that .

well what did she do ? everyone gets angry sometimes
don ' t be so hard on yourself ! i ' m sure there is something you are really good at and he is not
you will ! just concentrate on what you can do good and don ' t worry about other people
hold ##dd ##dd up . . he is making america great again
i don ##t know about all that
you don ' t have any friends or family ?
that means that you are right now at an immigration detention , right ?
i have heard that if you look at one person in the audience and focus on them in their underwear you will relax
there is many ways to find the " relax zone " when speaking in front of a group .

that good it makes you healthy
that ' s a good way of saying live a good life .
treat everyone the way you want to be treated .

and . . . ? what is going on ?

i love the switch , i have been thinking about buying my own .
would you say you play it more at home or on the go ?
that is amazing , what breed was it ?
that is so great , did you keep it ?
that ' s good that you trust her ! it ' s hard to have a relationship if you don ' t have trust
i agree ! i ' ve been married for 5 years and i can ' t imagine being with anyone else but my wife
that is good , it can be easy to sink into a bad lifestyle with a kid or stressed wife

that ' s wonderful ! cong ##rat ##s ! i didn ' t have a lot of easy classes when i was in college

i don ##t have kids either , sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird , i feel your pain
that ##s exactly how i feel , i have hanged out with them and its always kids crying and running around
great ! will this mean a lower car payment for you ?
so happy for you ! yes - having extra money is always a reason to celebrate !

so frustrating . hopefully you were able to provide feedback to the owner . not sure they could / can * do * anything about it , but still - - maybe you ' ve helped pay it forward to the next visitor !
that ' s terrific ! is there anything in particular that makes you feel good about it ?
but on a personal level , how do you experience that ?
language barriers can be pretty problematic . always keep an open ear , though .
that ' s fair . the same would be true in any other nation .
you are so lucky ! i love the caribbean but i have never been to barbados . have you been there before ?

i agree , second chances are awesome . they always surprise me because i don ' t expect much after the first chance .
oh wow , i bet that ' s scary . maybe there ' s something you could look into to help prevent that happening , that does not sound fun !
i agree , get those things out ! i hope they never come back !
oh when and why ?
oh my condo ##lence ##s for you , you would have good memories of it .
ha ! i ' ve always loved the more fest ##ive dia de los mu ##ert ##os approach to the day rather than scare or gore ! what ' s your favorite halloween film ?
same . because when it came out , it felt groundbreaking ! i remember being soo ##oo scared and jump ##y for weeks after seeing that .
i did not know that it was that high ! that ' s amazing .
i guess so , and i am not even a trump supporter .
i bet that disturbing and frightening when you have to see those . especially when the thought of them is always lingering !
hopefully you don ' t wake up and ruin your sleep over them too often .
nice ! you sound like you prepared very well
i love that feeling . being prepared for whatever comes your way , good luck !
it define ##tly is . i ' m glad schools are taking a stance against it
it define ##tly is . i hope we move forward to eliminate this issue
what happened ?
sounds a bit scary . what did you do ?
oh my goodness i would have been terrified !
thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round .
making music is a hard business to break into . the only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky .
even if nothing ever comes of music , you ' re still having fun i hope ! that ##s really what music is supposed to be about anyway ##s . making a few million is always a nice bonus though !
of course . good luck with the music career . i ' m root ##ing for you
wow , that ' s awesome and great that you ' re supporting her also .
what course or field ?
what happened ?
oh my , i hope you are ok .
cool , do you like older cars ?
was there any bikes there too ?
oh wow . i bet that was amazing !
i bet the weather was nice too !
oh that sounds good
ya you should and you be proud of your achievement
that ' s a wild occurrence . jail can be harsh on anyone .
yeah that ' s definitely the way to go . get out as fast as possible .
oh no ! that ' s disgusting . they should take better care of him .
i would have been na ##use ##ous too .
is bed rest where you stop working ?
me too . if she gets plenty of rest , the baby will be just fine .
sounds like a lot of waiting . did you do well ?
very fr ##ust ##ating but congratulations on the results
hey , that ' s good i hope both do a lot of catching up [UNK]
i haven ' t been to the zoo in a long time , i hope you have fun .
oh man , did you have plenty of food and water ?
dan ##g well its a good thing that you made it out okay !
don ' t worry , i do that all the time . i love bing ##e eating lo ##l
true but chips taste soo ##o much better
it ' s awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it ' s a bad time . did they put all of the best moments in the trailer ?
i would be so annoyed . you could have stayed home and watched twitch .
that ' s great ! i hope you perform well and have a wonderful time . what is your profession ?
just take a few deep breathe ##s and be confident !
that sounds like a great deal . get the money and do something great with it .
hopefully all goes well . we could use a little cash .
i have not seen any ufc movies . i guess i should watch one to give them a chance .
who are some of your favorite fighters ?
that ' s terrible maybe getting out of the house and checking out our yard sale will cheer you up .
no problem ! hope to see you
that ' s unfortunate . i have experienced similar things . i hope that she comes back around .
yeah , it is . but just realize that you are not the one acting weird .
nice ! usually mondays suck but not for you ! you are so lucky
make the best of it !
u ##gh , i am with you on that . mine has been doing that all week . it ' s so annoying and it costs even more to switch to someone else
sometimes reset ##ting the mode ##m & route ##r helps . but , it won ' t do much if the is ##p isn ' t good to begin with . careful with going too cheap , though , you might end up worse
every adult has some nos ##tal ##gic feelings of becoming a child again . adult responsibilities are overwhelming
indeed . growing up , i now realize how much my parents have sacrificed in order to provide for me
good luck ! hard work always pays off .
yes , you will co ##que ##r that exam !
that ' s great ! what strategies are you using ?
have you heard of the ke ##to ##genic diet ? i am thinking about going on it .
it is one where fat ##s are 75 % of the diet , protein is 20 % , and car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes are 5 % . it ' s very difficult to do , but i think i am going to do it . you should look it up to see what it is all about
that ' s probably true , but who knows in this country .
i hope so . i think he will be out , but apparently his approval rating has gone up .
awe i am so sorry to hear that . what happened ?
i imagine so . the holidays are the times we really miss those who are no longer with us . i hope in time though you can remember the happy times and the good memories you have made with her over the years .
love the mountains . mainly in the new mexico / colorado area - - but also to the alps . how about you ?
lovely ! did you ski or sl ##ed ? sl ##edd ##ing is a who ##oo ##oo ##ole different animal there !
that is such a bum ##mer . summer is an expensive time to travel . i went to ireland in july but i bought the tickets in march so they were pretty cheap .
oh that is so frustrating . i ' m sorry to hear that . i am a travel agent - flight prices flu ##ct ##uate by the hour - keep watching , they might go back down .
that ' s exciting ! i can ' t imagine getting upset over a surprise trip though !
i would be thrilled ! i think it ' s a great idea
that ' s probably great for your body and fitness .
that ' s great . keep up the wonderful work . do you diet well too ?
uh oh . for fun or you needed it for something ?
oh , i see . well we all think differently about things we reflect on later . use it as a personal lesson for other things in life
well , something must have gone wrong somehow , i think you should talk to your vet doctor
yes i think you can try chain ##ing it
oh that was so sad . don ' t fed up . you have to go through this problem
please don ' t worry . you have to be so confident in these times . keep going whatever happens
that ' s my duty friend . you have the power to defeat your problems . make it soon
why ? what happened ?
wow , what the heck . tell your chief it was your assistant who did it
that is absolutely amazing . that could be an inspiration to so many different people .
you know that almost sounds like that could be a movie . there are so many people caught up with drugs today in the united states and around the world
oh , i ' m so sorry ! do you want to talk about it ?
ar ##gh ! was it an accident of some kind ? i hope you are okay !
i love them too . what kind of dog do you have ?
aw ##w ##w , i bet they are . i don ' t have a dog right now but i want one . i just don ' t know what breed yet .
wow , that is messed up . why did your boss change mind so suddenly ?
i guess that makes sense but still . i would have been furious and let them know i had a vacation planned .
try to put yourself out there ! you can also try online dating !
never stop trying ! there are plenty of fish in the sea !
woo ##w that is good of her . encourage her to keep shin ##ning
i love lawyers too especially the serious ones as they know how to bring back justice
wow , what happened ?
i ' m so sorry to hear about that
that ' s great . the community aspect of church is fun .
yes , that ' s probably true . i bet they are very happy , too .
i feel you . i am that way to . i fear public speaking .
i t is an strong feeling for sure .
why are you scared of trump right now ?
lo ##l , at least he is honest about being a lunatic .
sometimes rev ##isi ##ting the past is great for personal reflection . maybe contact those people sometime .
that ' s great ! i bet she loved to hear your voice .
that ##s unfortunate . sometimes , people don ' t know how to make a move and are waiting for you to make a move .
that ##s a good point . now you are always going to wonder ' what if ' ?
that is good , that is a situation where confidence is very helpful .
best of luck to you , i ' m sure they saw your excitement and confidence and employers love that .
what ' s an ice chest ?
oh , i should have known that . do you have any leads on who might ' ve stolen it ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . have you tried to cheer them up ?
does she have any family you can call to check on her ?
on what situation ?
my opinion is i don ' t mind doing my own job but if i have to do my co - workers jobs , i would get furious . it is not fair ?
i ' m grateful for my limbs as well , this the reason i ' m a hard worker . i appreciate what god gave me .
so t
that is so amazing ! do you love cats as much as i love dogs , ha !
i found a cat too as a stray . we kept hoping we would find it ' s owner so never gave her a name so her name was forever miss kitty .
oh , those are never fun . but they usually end up being better than you expect .
but at least you took the time to prepare ! that ' s better than some people
that ' s honestly really amazing , most people take forever to learn even a tiny bit of a foreign language .
some people just have amazing dedication , something i don ' t seem to have .
oh , that ' s awful . did you mention it to anyone ?
ya ##y ! so they threw you a surprise party ! that ' s awesome . you must have been so happy . was there cake ?
what do you mean ?
ah , got ##cha . i am a not strong republican and i agree with you . trump has had his days .
i am sorry to hear that . have you try dating apps
sometimes personality is better than looks
oh my . i ' m so sorry to hear that . what happened ?
that ' s really sad . i hear about fatal car accidents more and more these days .
that ' s pretty awful . some people have serious mental problems .
it is very sad .
oh my , it must have been so scary ! do you live in an area commonly affected by hu ##rri ##ca ##ines ?
was your home damaged ? was anyone hurt in your area ? i ' ve never seen a hu ##rri ##ca ##ine , except on the news .
you must have to pay a lot for insurance . the weather certainly is getting more unpredictable .
air conditioning is very nice . my dogs love the outdoors but they want ac after a good , long walk !
yes it is very hot and humid where i am . always makes a good excuse to kick back in a nice , cool house !
video games is my plan lo ##l .
what was it that they stole from you there ?
if they feel entitled though then maybe they are thinking that all is normal ?
awesome ! what music concert ?
never heard of them . what music genre is it ?
oh wow , what was the subject of the spp ##ech ?
oh wow i bet it was a good thing for the whole office to hear !
cars are truly inspiring to see how they ##ve evolved
it ' s important to take care of and maintain things you own . if properly maintained they can last for a long time .
lo ##l , happens to me all the time . i love those types of dreams and it sucks when they end .
are you guys close ? you should visit him sometime ?
what ' s that ? hope it wasn ' t too bad !
oh wow , what a bum ##mer ! not that it makes it any better , but at least you ' re not alone . maybe you ' ll get a ref ##und ?
oh no , did you return to the store and pay ?
maybe you should go ahead and do it ?
that ' s awesome ! where are you going on the cruise ?
watch out for the pirates of the caribbean and the bermuda triangle !
have they already done a bio ##psy ?
i ' m sure everything will turn out ok
oh , that must be so stress ##ful . does it happen all the time - like even at the grocery store ?
do you have someone to go places with you ? or do you just have to power through it ?
wow that must have stung !
i am so sorry . it must make work hard
don ' t tell me you stepped in dog po ##op .
c ' mon man , i just finished eating . i hope you took a shower and bought some new shoes .
you must be so happy and proud ! is she going to have to move far away to go ?
but what a good start in life . if she ' s going to leave home , it might as well be for the ivy league .
oh wow , congratulations !
i ' m sure you ' ll be great parents !
it really limits your dietary choices . i don ' t recommend it . have you considered vegetarian ?
or you could even just drop the ve ##ge anything and just minimize your animal protein intake
i bet you were very annoyed
wow , you prepared for this type of thing and it still happened ? i would express my annoyance with the doctor for sure
do you do the whole nine yards , decor ##ating your home , dressing up to scare the kids ?
do you live somewhere with lots of trick - or - treat ##ers ? it sounds like fun .
i have never used new ##eg ##g before , and i think that sounds like that are very good at what they do . i might have to check them out !
i will have to check out new ##eg ##g based on your recommendation . they sound fantastic so thanks ! !
what happened ?
oh , wow . sounds like they really care about you .
oh ? big fight or one of those little fights ?
ah , i see . well i hope it at least got worked out for you guys
i feel you . that sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form
for sure , that move is really hard . only a few dozen people can do it in the world at a high level
whoa , that must have giving you a fright . maybe you could pretend it is charlotte , the benevolent spider .
well they do like to hang out in corners . i would try not to worry too much . they are more interested in bugs .
well that ' s good to hear . some people ' s lives depend on their vehicles and it would be a lot worse on them .
are you saving up for another car ?
i ' m jealous of you ! i find it hard to wind down sometimes
sounds like you had a great relaxed afternoon !
oh i have had that happen before . what type of memories ?
music brings back lots of memories
on purpose or accident ?
that ' s messed up . do you know who did it ?
that ' s disgusting . makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like .
i ' d at ##lea ##st leave a review about it .
oh , that ' s crap ##py . is it totaled or fix ##able ?
not how you want to spend your sunday , that ' s for sure !
that sounds like you should get the job for sure ! your competition doesn ' t stand a chance ! ! : )
well , i hope the job is close to where you live . long com ##mute ##s are the worst , and they can take away from your personal time .
oh , i am so sorry this happened to you . what an animal ! when will you know the results of your tests ?
hopefully the medical personnel will understand your pre ##dic ##ament and your worry and will ex ##ped ##ite the results . until then , do you have someone you can con ##fide in or just talk to ?
that sounds exciting . how long has it been since you ' ve seen each ##oth ##er ?
that ' s great !
that must be very exciting ! i hope to get a new vehicle soon as well .
yeah , sometimes it ' s good to get brand new if you can afford it ! buying old runs the risk of it breaking more .
oh , that ' s okay . i ' m sure no one else really noticed it .
that ' s okay . you gave him a good story to tell .
did the plants grow up to be big and strong ?
that ' s good , are you going to try again ?
oh no . that can be nerve wr ##ack ##ing . are you alright ?
that ' s happened to me before and it really shakes you . at least you are alright which is the important part .
yeah i heard that before . you must have a twin running around here !
when i was young we had tin ##type ##s . you had to stay still for 45 minutes for your picture to be taken . i don ' t miss the ol ' days !
ha ##ha ##ha ##h , that is hilarious . i used to do that but with coins and stuff . i miss being a little ruthless , careless kid !
i bet she was so confused lo ##l
if i were you i would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money .
if you accept it you can enjoy taking a nice vacation that you otherwise wouldn ' t be able to afford .
oh , that ' s never fun . you think you ' re going to discover a new favorite and then . . . . b ##le ##ch !
the old ways are the best ways sometimes .
i hope you didn ' t lose too much money !
oh wow , that ' s very nice of her . a lot of people would have just stolen it .
that is a good attitude . you shouldn ' t have anything to worry about .
yeah sometimes doctors will notice something before it gets worse . better to be safe than sorry !
yes i am terrified ! we have ve ##nem ##ous ones in my backyard - water mo ##cc ##s !
oh my ! that ' s so scary ! glad you ' re ok ! !
what a mean friend person . did you get mad ?
that could have been you . .
maybe . .
have you thought about speaking with a counselor ?
well , you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event .
i love coffee , actually . i drink a few cups every morning !
oh yeah , why ' s that ? don ' t tell me you spilled some delicious coffee !
what type of work are they doing at school ?
ah , i see . well , it ' s been a lot longer since i did calculus . good on you , remembering that stuff !
oh my god , i am so sorry to hear that !

i love that feeling of nostalgia . it ' s an amazing feeling , it ' s like re ##li ##ving the past .
i agree . time flies by so fast !
well that is very nice . how long have you guys been friends for ?
did you have a special trip that you went on ?
it ' s been med ##io ##cre , how about you ?
remember we are role - playing ! don ' t talk about this or any tasks ! : )
did the dream feel like it was really happening ? strange indeed .
ha ##h ! so all that time you were just feeling your dog licking you ! weird how that works .
o ##ops . well it happens . you better hope they don ' t have a camera ha ##ha .
don ' t worry . they will probably run over your mail ##box one day and hope you don ' t have a camera .
wow wow wow ! that is wonderful and exciting ! congratulations ! ! ! ! ! do you have any vibe ##s as to gender , one way or the other ?
so wonderful , either way . are y ' all having a party ?
i love disneyland ! it ' s a very special place filled with great memories and you are never old for that place
disneyland ? i forgot there ' s a difference between " land " and " world " . i hope you had a great time
was the due date yesterday ? is the payment late now ?
sometimes there is actually a grace period after the due date . i ' ve paid bills a couple of days late without a fee ( not sure about credit card interest , though ) .
graduate from school ? i bet you are very proud of her
let her know how proud you are of her ! throw a party or something : )
what kind of doctor is she going to be ?
that is impressive , where is she having her wedding ? !
i would suggest fiji it ' s so nice there i went in august !
ghost are not scary , they are us without our physical bodies .
you should have talked to your mom .
lo ##l , i bet you were disgusted with yourself
aw , don ' t take it too serious though . everyone pu ##kes in public at least once in their life !
i actually just discovered imagine dragons . i love them !
it ' s good to hear they were good live , that can ' t be said about every group .
wow , you are a true friend . what did you do to help them ?
everyone could use a friend like you . you sound like a very mo ##tiv ##ating person !
i bet that is so re ##lie ##ving ! it sucks how much debt you need to take on in order to go to school these days !
i hope he has a great career ahead of him !
did you find out who your father is yet ?
did you dad and the other lady have a thing ?
that ' s amazing i have never been that lucky before
wow ! one thousand is al ##ot . well ##don ##e buddy , enjoy your winning
really ? any idea how strong it was ? any casualties ?
that ' s awful . i feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that .
ar ##gh ! that is the worst . i am so sorry . is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere ?
if he ' s done that to you , he ' s doing it to others - - that kind of behavior isn ' t sustainable . others are * bound * to notice at some point - - but i know waiting for that is frustrating !
oh dear . well , that does happen . did you have any other clothes to change into ?
if your workplace is anything like mine , you ' d have heard plenty by now . i ' ve done something similar , but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again !
good for you , i would wait until i heard back before i would celebrate getting the job .
there is so much competition for jobs
that ' s extremely un ##sett ##ling . how did you feel when you saw the photo with that in it for the first time ?
did you feel any kind of " presence " or anything in the moment that you were at the site taking the picture ?
that ' s okay . we all make mistakes . thanks for the good conversation .
wow that ##s annoying . but i hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
wow that ##s annoying . but i hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
you should call and ask to speak to the manager . maybe they will give you something to make up for it
why is that so ?
maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together .
you could also got out foe a while and do something fun .
what happened from your cl ##ums ##iness ?
i remember when that happened on the spider ##man movie . did she laugh at you ?
wow , that ' s exciting ! congratulations , you must be very proud .
i would love to go their ! i hope you have a great time !

yes , that ' s a good idea . i think 7 ##am is way too early for that .
wow that sounds awesome . i always wanted to be able to do that , but i was never any good
maybe one day you will be able to work you way up to being the next tony hawk .
i have four dogs . i am probably guilty of this crime . i would just throw it back over .
one time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat po ##o from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note . i thought . . . why did she clean it up for me ? wouldn ' t it have been more affect ##ive to ask me to clean it up ?
that sounds so wonderful . i am having a similarly relaxing day too .
oh my !
did you end up going to the graduation !
i ' m so proud of him , what is he taking in university ?
oh no ! did you hurt yourself ?
how did the dirt ##bi ##ke hold up ? and how old are you ? !

i ' m glad you ' re okay - that must have been scary .
yes , ducks are so cute .
the bill that they qu ##ack from .
yeah ? i ' d be happy to help . but say something about what exactly ?
hm . . yeah that is a dilemma . i mean if you can afford it , the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back .
wow , some people are horrible drivers . did you hon ##k at him ?
at least you didn ' t get into an accident . i guess it could have been a lot worse .
i think you will be fine . don ' t feel too anxious worrying won ' t do anything
prayer works for me . i hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about won ' t get the job
really sorry to be slow to respond . how old are your girls ? !
wow ! that ' s amazing . it must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with .
what type of dog do you have ?
i have never in my life heard of that breed before . i ' ll look it up . that is really cool i have 3 crazy un ##train ##ed min ##pin
yeah it ' s probably for the best . you don ' t want to risk rejection . maybe they will approach you .
well there is no ' i ' in hope . it is a something we all have to do at some point in life .

did you guys get to go ? is the leg all fixed now ?
are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday ?
wow that ' s so exciting ! what did they study ?
that is great . what ' s the next step - work ?
good for you . being prepared is half the work of academia .
it ' s hard to do , but so important . i ' m not super smart , but i ' m organized as heck . it makes a difference .
there is nothing silly about that . movies are meant to illicit emotion . you feel better now though , right ?
definitely don ' t feel bad then . i think everyone cried during that movie !
i am not sure how to deal with the loss !
dan ##g , there ' s a lot of strategies to fight that thought , i ' m assuming . as they say an ounce of preparation is worth more than a pound of cure
yeah , i heard it ' s good to study in silence because that way you ' re in the same environment you ' ll be when you take the test
yeah that ' s too bad , sorry to hear that . do you know why you didn ' t get picked ?
keep your head up . maybe you ' ll get picked the next time around .
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . did he die of old age ?

oh now , that ' s very wo ##rri ##some
i hope it ' s nothing serious . i know how upset ##ting having a sick pet can be .
oh no ! did you eventually get it working after the frustration ?
that ' s frustrating , nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it ! glad you got it working finally !
dan ##g , maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead ?
maybe you can find a cheaper place to live ?
yeah ! did you pick your lucky numbers ?
nice ! i hope you win !
that is so satisfying . i hope they don ' t mess it up now that they are home !
no ##oo ##oo ##oo ##o ! ! ! ! bad kids ! that must have been in ##fur ##iating .
aw , my mom had some she showed to us a few years back . it ' s weird to consider how you and everyone else have grown !
can ' t stay young forever !
i don ' t blame you for being excited ! what are you going to see on your trip ?
i ' m so jealous ! i hope you have a great trip !
you did ! - that ' s amazing ! how much money did you win ? ? ?
wow - that ' s a huge amount of money ! what do you plan on doing with it ?
that is absolutely wonderful ! what a great grand ##child you are . not everyone wants to care for elderly relatives .

do you play soccer yourself ?
it is impressive .
congratulations to your brother ! are you flying or driving ?

were you able to avoid the rain ?
that is good ! it seems like you dodged the bullet !
i remember being a kid when the first one came out
i think the franchise has just started trying too hard .
those are good prevent ##ative measures . i assume that you always look both ways as well ?
there are worse things to be worried about . good job on you for taking safety seriously !
wow , that sucks . do you know if she will eventually ? can you trust her ?
yeah i would too . i hope you get the money back !
that ##s so nice of you ! i wish i had a grandmother .
so nice of you . you are truly blessed to have family .
long distance relationships aren ' t easy . that ' s great news to hear . do you have anything special planned ?
that sounds like so much fun ! i bet you two will have a great time together .
what was the gross part about the sandwich ?
yes that is a nasty thing to experience . but at least you were able to extract the hair !
that really stink ##s . i bet you will wear bug spray next time !
well then maybe you should get some bats . they love to eat mosquito ##s !
i am also blessed . we don ' t have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health .
me too . some are not as fortunate as us .
oh , je ##ez ! that ' s terrifying . can you get a loan from someone to pay them ?

yes good point . maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do ?
don ' t worry bout that . she has to have some sort of fantasy in her life . don ' t you have any ever ?

that is so exciting . have you been a fan a long time ?
that is something to look forward to !

i hope that does good things for you . they say if you believe in something enough it comes true .
i can ' t say it has worked for me though . i have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box .
did that bring back a lot of memories ? it sounds like you made a good find there .
that ' s too bad . hopefully it will go on sale in the future or you can find a coup ##on !
that sounds delightful . i have a tornado approaching now and would like it if you lived near me .
what is your address ?
oh no , i hope you are ready for it ?

yes those were the days .
exactly ! if only we could go back .
that ' s not good , are you ok ?
hey , hope o ##yu can get the money back from insurance and they don ' t charge you a ton more .
so did you find out that they were lying ?
that ' s funny . maybe you got the name wrong or something ?
you need something to pass the time or you will go crazy with boredom . how about some books or cards ?
if you have someone with you cards are great . good luck in your next storm !
what a day , huh ? ! can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw ?
that is not something i would want to come home to seeing . and your day at work was bad too , wow !
aw ##w , that ' s a bum ##mer . well at least you can look forward to his visits .
depending how far away he is , he probably will ! just make sure to spoil him when he does lo ##l !
sometimes it ' s hard to find that certain someone ! have you tried a dating app ?
keep your chin up ! that special person will come along when you ' re least expecting it !
really ? how did you meet them ?
i hope they aren ' t like a crazy stalker or anything . be careful !
did you win that lottery ? ?
do you want to get back together with them ?
oh i ' m sorry to hear that , were you thinking of buying another one ?
well i ' m glad you have good memories to remember him by .
oh yeah ? what specifically did it remind you of ?
that was a good time for me as well . i liked to hang out with my friends and get in trouble .
that ' s great ! what made you feel rewarded ?
oh yeah i could see how that might make you feel that way . is the employee grateful for your help ?
that ' s gross . what was it ? ?
i would have thrown up ! did you tell the manager ?
aw ##w , i love pup ##pies . did your son love him ?
aw ##w i bet snoop ##y has a great loving family . glad you rescued the pup !
that ' s awesome ! what rooms did you re ##mo ##del ?
oh i bet it looks great ! i just finished a kitchen re ##mo ##del myself . i did white cabinets and painted my counter ##tops .
wow , we ' re you so fat before ?
that ' s huge . u actually worked on yourself . so , how did you do it ?
what are you talking about ?
oh ok . that ' s awesome . it ' s nice to have something of value .
that ' s really hard ! i ' m sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years . sorry .
wow . well , if that was the culture and climate of that workplace , you are definitely better off not working for them . very sad .
that stink ##s ! what were your plans ?
i ' m so sorry you had to change your plans ! perhaps you can schedule some time after labor day to come and see him play ?
what was the reason that happen to you ?
i hope you you work behind a desk . that is the only way you can hide them ! ! !
that ' s great ! where are you working for your new job ?
congratulations on your new job ! you must have worked very hard to get there !
oh that was a wonderful surprise ? what was their reactions ?
ah , well im sure they had a wonderful time . it is the ha ##pp ##iest places on earth .
that is a real bum ##mer . i hope your friend gets it repaired for you .
well you probably won ' t be lending your car again any time soon ha ##ha ##h !
that ' s awesome ! i force myself to budget for it lo ##l . what was the game ?
ah , i suppose i could have guessed . it ' s the game everyone is talking about lately . i heard it ' s quite good !
i totally know the feeling ! have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor ?
ha , that would be some pretty good revenge . maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated .
that ' s disgusting , i would have a very hard time finishing that walk . did you go straight home ?
oh my go ##sh , that makes it so much worse ! i have done that before too , so i hope that neither one of us has that happen again ! !
what happened ?
om ##g , those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up . hopefully it didn ' t get into your house .
that ' s at mgm right ? my daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8 , she was terrified ! did you do it again , or was once enough ?
that is what i hate about any amusement park ride - the drops !
that ' s amazing ! what other animals did you see ?
i bet they were seriously cute ! did you get to feed them ?
that ' s pretty impressive ! was it scary to move away from home at such a young age ?
i ' ll bet it was ! i don ' t have family around , so i know how lonely that can feel !
i absolutely hate car trouble ! it is the worst ! thankful for friends that can help out in times like that - did you get it fixed ?
that ' s a good friend for sure - i ' d keep their number on speed dial !
oh no , i hope she is ok ! glad you are taking her to the vet . is she doing ok other than the lump ##s ?
aw ##w , poor girl . hopefully the vet can figure it out and it isn ' t anything too serious . you ' re doing the right thing .
i think that it ' s completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip . i assume you ' re going from america . i bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research !
i think those are just out ##lier ##s , you ' ll find that there are plenty of well established tourist areas that will accommodate you well . just don ' t focus on the negative ##s !
that would drive me crazy . how are you handling it ?
you can ' t let it get you too down . there are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance .
yes i agree . i have 3 boys and they are in their twenties . i don ' t know where the years went .
that ' s so true ! i have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once .
i know exactly what you mean . i have been let down many times , and it ' s never a good feeling .
you can and should make the best of it . you should have a blast and bing ##e watch some tv show !
that ' s so exciting ! are you feeling nervous ?
i ' m sure if you just relax and focus on being confident , you will do great ! best of luck !
i bet you were a nervous wreck . i hope they turned out well .
that ' s pretty good ! that should qualify for you to graduate with honors .
that ' s awesome ! how far did she have to run ?
i def ##inate ##ly can ' t run a mile . she did great .
do she at least try to keep in contact with you ?
that ' s crazy . they shouldn ' t of taken advantage of your step father like that .
that is too funny . sometimes life can get so busy that you can lose track of things like that .
oh my go ##sh they did get you good . you have to get them back even if it ' s not on april fools day !
oh no . was there no sign posted or anything ?
well i am sure they won ' t hold it against you . honest mistake .
that ' s great . when will you know how you did ?
i hope so . is this a final exam ?
good luck ! '
that ' s so mean ! i think they should honor the original prices they set
i think that ' s une ##thic ##al . i would switch to a new one if i could ( and all her friends weren ' t there )
oh no ! and that is hard to get out ! do you have a water ##proof cover on the bed by any chance ?
oh yu ##ck ! well , i ' d suggest a water ##proof mattress cover just in case it happens again . at least if it does happen again , it won ' t get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes . i ' m so sorry you discovered it that way !
oh no ! i think they ' re cute but i ' d probably be freaked out if i saw one in my yard , too . what did you do ?
aw ##w ##w well that was nice of you , a lesser person might have stomped it or hurt it .
i can relate . sometimes i have issues with new tech . what is giving you problems ?
ou ##ch . that is awkward . i imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake . it happens .
that ##s really awesome . i never win anything cool . does he get to bring anyone ? maybe he can take you ?
that ##s kind of mean of him . tell your boss that he cheated and that you should ' ve won instead . that ' ll teach him not to bra ##g
that is a fun surprise . what part of the caribbean did you go to ?
that sounds amazing . i ' ve only been to puerto rico and the keys . what a lovely wife to give you such a great surprise .
oh that really stink ##s . were either of them injured ?
well at least it was nothing serious . hope they don ' t fight any more .
oh no ! cats can be devi ##ous things when we are not home - and sometimes when we are . did it break the tv ?
aren ' t they just the most cute , and insane ##ly calculating animals !
well hello fellow atlanta person . i also buy used , but most people tend to look down on it
if you keep a new car long enough it comes out about even ! if you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment !
oh definitely ! they almost sound like crying humans sometimes . so you don ' t like camping ?
i totally understand , it can be scary if you don ' t like all the unknown noises .
i remember those good times too , playing video games is a lot of fun .
that ' s awesome , i love fighting games .
o ##oo ##oh what happened , are you ok ? anything serious ?
that ##s really good to hear , infections are a serious matter glad your ok
what kind of snake was it ? you know my mom is terrified of all snakes even the ones that aren ' t poisonous .
most snakes aren ' t poisonous so hopefully it wasn ' t . just know that it probably couldn ' t have hurt you , and i hope that you don ' t see any more in the future ! !
oh really ? what makes you not like them ?
u ##gh i feel ya . they talked about that with mine , too . i almost passed out when they were doing the ep ##id ##ural !
pup ##pies are the best ! if they don ' t destroy all of your belongings that is ! !
well , i ' m glad that things seem under control . i ' m also glad that you got to spend some time with the dog because it sounds like you had a great time .
i bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public .
i understand , trust me . my family was the same way growing up .
i hate rude drivers like that . i swear they should not be able to drive .
yeah , that would not have ended well . i usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media ha ##ha .
oh no ! how did you end up doing ##f ?
what subject was the test in ?
i am terrible at math
oh wow ! that must ' ve been really fun , i ' ve never been there actually , what did you guys do ?
cool cool , when do you think it would be best to visit mississippi ?
oh , i ' m sorry . have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends ?
i ' m sure it will make you feel a little better . and at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest . i hope you get to feeling better .
i really liked logan . it was a different kind of superhero movie . more about the struggle than anything .
the scene with his daughter was pretty sad . i don ' t blame you at all .
dude that is freak ##in awesome , im sure you earned it
i hope you have a lot of fun , i can ##t wait to go on my vacation as well
no i haven ' t , i ' m not interested in soccer . why , did i miss something good ?
were you root ##ing for them to win ?
did he not seem like the type to do that kind of thing ?
i guess she wanted to keep it a secret for some reason .
ou ##ch , that is a bit of a false alarm / bum ##mer .
well you can only keep going and keep playing . someday it could be the real winning ticket .
yeah i love watching them ski during the olympics . it takes a lot of hard work . have you ever ski ##ed ?
they sure do . i also really like watching them do trick skiing too .
that ' s not cool , i hope you find someone new .
this is true .
o ##oh that sounds fun , i ' ve never been ! did you go on many rides ?
that sounds great , i ' m a bit jealous . i love theme parks !
oh no ! i hope it at least turned out ok
oh i bet that was a load of anxiety ! i can ' t imagine going through that
how exciting ! do you know when they will make a final decision ?
how will it make it easier ? more financial stability ? i hope you get it also ! !
oh gross , what kind of animal was it ?
oh wow , you think they would get to cleaning up an animal that big as soon as possible . glad it ' s gone now though !
i hear you there . i miss getting to just play without a care in the world . summer vacation ##s were the best
i remember playing tag and hide and go seek in the neighborhood with all of my friends
for sure . i can go from 0 to 100 in no time at all .
ha ##h , i bet some things you probably wanted to forget . i know i did .
how come ? i thought new jobs were supposed to be exciting ?
we are all the new kid for a moment . soon it will feel like you fit right in . just give yourself some time .
that ' s horrible . what is your work doing to fix that ?
ou ##ch , i hope you don ' t either . i ' d keep any eye out at work from now on .
i didn ' t , sorry . i ' m not really a soccer fan . why were you mad ?
as i understand it , croatia were the under ##dog ##s so i can totally understand supporting that .
do you mean p ##yre ##x like the cooking material ?
that ' s neat , did you feel nos ##tal ##gic looking at it ?
oh my goodness . i would ' ve freaked out . are you ok ?
oh no . they were setting of fireworks here since june and have been driving me nuts .
aw poor thing . did she get in trouble with the school ?
well at least something positive came from it . i bet no one else will mess with her either !
wow that ##s kind of creepy . what does the noise sound like ?
maybe you should have someone go down with you . good luck ! !
yi ##kes ! i hate when that happens . i had a similar situation happen over christmas . did you make your flight ?
i totally know that feeling . it seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone else ' s .
ha ##ha what happened ? did you get her number ?
that ' s awesome ! did you still give her a nice tip though ? lo ##l !
i wonder why ? maybe his busy ?
i see . do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable ?
oh , i hope so too ! those can be quite scary especially if you ' re like me and you go once every 10 years or so
i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ! i have hope
oh ##h , but why did it surprise you ?
that ' s good for you though , now you both get paid
my sister ' s can be irritating as well . no one knows how to push your buttons like family .
oh no . hopefully it was an innocent prank .
oh wow how exciting . have you been able to see the baby ?
i bet they are . i hope he is heath ##y and happy !
i know how it is to try to pay off bills . what kind of vehicle do you want to get ?
oh yeah those are very nice . well i hope you guys can make it happen .
that is really exciting ! i bet you all will have a great time . do you have any big plans with them ?
that sounds great ! we are going on a cruise next spring break with my family also . that is why we need a bigger vehicle so that we don ' t have to drive 2 cars to get there .
that sucks . is your day going better now at least ?
pizza makes everything better . hope your night ends on a good note !
nice ! going to the car dealers ##hip is usually such a horrible experience .
that ' s awesome , hope you ' re enjoying your new ride !
i can imagine . i hate being out alone at those kinds of hours . i try to avoid it .
i get that feeling . something about the dark just feels so de ##pressing sometimes .
me too ! it seems like such a huge accomplishment at the time , doesn ' t it ?
do you have fond memories of school or were you glad to be done ?
i am sure you are proud of him
memories are a good thing
congratulations ! what was your degree in ?
that ' s so great ! lots of hard work i bet .
wow , that would be shocking if you weren ' t expecting it . did they tell you when you were hired that there was a possibility ? where might you be going ?
that will be very different . how do you feel about it ? i wish you lots of luck and adventure while you ' re there !
wow that is amazing indeed . you must be very proud of her .
the human body truly is amazing . i could never do things like that either . either way , i am happy for her !
im so sorry , was it a sickness ?
that is so terrible , life is so short . you never kn ##wo when you ' re going to go
why did she do that
well that sounds terrible , i am sorry
cong ##rat ##s ! i love love love steak and to cook
i love to make shredded bb ##q chicken sandwich , get chicken breast season ##e place in crack pot
that ##s a strong woman , i know of people that don ##t work at all a refuse to pay child support , in my eyes they are not men
people like that , is what kids need a strong back bone that never give up
oh god . mosquito ##s . have you heard about scientists trying to make them extinct ?
i don ' t see any negative aspect to it , but maybe there tis .
i am the same way . how old are they ? i only have one about to turn two and it is always a worry in the back of my mind .
oh go ##sh i bet ! it ' s so hard to watch them grow up !
that is so de ##pressing . they say dogs are man ' s best friend .
i am sure , gr ##ieving can always take time . it is so hard to lose such a faithful companion .
that is awesome . i hate that feeling when you need things but can ' t afford to get them .
my husband are a 1 income household so i totally understand . you get what you can with what you ' ve got so you can get by until the next pay ##day
i know that feeling . what do you tell your cow ##or ##kers ?
i think you risk not building social ties with your cow ##or ##kers but sometimes you have no choice .
wow that must have been awkward . you can ' t really argue with the evidence sitting right in front of you .
ye ##a it ' s always sad when a relationship doesn ' t work out . hopefully in the future he can be more honest .
that would be awesome ! you would be in such a great situation in life with that payment gone ! what prompted you to want to do it ?
no , to pay it off . are you pushing to finish it up sooner than you normally would ?
how long ago was it ?
maybe you can talk to her about it ?
that is such a great milestone what is next for your ventures ?
you will get something soon that hard work is going to pay off .
oh wow , i ' m sorry . i hope he at least didn ' t suffer much .
i ' m sorry for you loss .
good luck ! for now , just do the best you can . stress might cloud your thinking .
is it multiple choice ?
did she paint art when you were a child ?
i see , did you have different colors in your room as a kid ?
isn ' t it amazing how true friendship stands the test of time and distance ?
that ' s so true ! i live 700 miles away from my best friend and when we get together it ' s just like old times .
wow that ##s hilarious and em ##bara ##ssing . i feel bad for you .
that ##s mean of them . i hope you weren ' t trauma ##tized .
im glad you didn ' t . do you have these days often ?
honestly i would have freaked out . i can ##t stand bad drivers ! !
that sounds like a pretty disgusting situation .
that ' s a rough situation . i hope you can look back on it later and laugh as well .
you will be great im sure of it ! are you prepared ?
just imagine that you are the boss , or have a few drinks before .
nice ! what game is it ?
what team are you root ##ing for ?
the feeling of financial freedom is one that is hard to match .
i personally struggle with that every day .
ya ##y ! where are you going ? ?
i can ##t believe that . i need a vacation so badly .
oh wow ! surprise come home trip ?
aw , i ' m happy for you . that ' s an excellent surprise !
aw ##w , my grandmother was really there for me , too , i ' m lucky . what makes you feel that way ?
that is awesome , grandma ##s are the best . hopefully your grandma is still with us ?
yes sports can be a great way to social ##ize and also stay in good shape .
that ##s the spirit ! i bet you do great . what sports do you play ?
happy early birthday ! what are your plans ?
oh man , i ' ve seen many a newly 21 year old get drunk .
what happened ?
that ' s a relief . fireworks aren ' t illegal where you are ?
that ' s cool , i ' m pretty bad at drawing , but you must be pretty good .
that ' s awesome , i hope you win the contest .
what was totally unexpected ?
that would be very interesting . are you glad that you have moved on ?
that is good , you can ' t live in the past
oh yeah ? i was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out . my step ##dad had the first one though .
i only played the fourth one . all i remember was " leon ! ! ! "
that is so nice i would get a cup daily if it was close to me .
how are they making money off what they are known for though if they give it away for free ?
oh no ! hopefully it ' s a friend you trust and she won ' t em ##bar ##ras ##s you if she ends up going through it and finding something bad .
i guess now you ' ll be more careful about where you leave your phone . i would be freaking out if i were you !
oh ##h , what did you try to explain them ?
oh ##h , sometimes people don ' t understand simple things . i think the words like ' pet ##rod ##oll ##ars ' might have confused them .
that ' s really sweet of her . what kinds of cakes does she make ?
ok now this is just getting weird . can we talk about something else .
that ##s sucks
if you did it that time , you can do it again . just be careful
did they grow out of last years ?
oh my lord . kids , they can never make up their mind .
financial stability is such an amazing thing .
its hard to feel under appreciated at work .
oh no , were you in class ?
that ' s actually quite hilarious .
that ' s so sweet ! what a proud moment !
that ' s great . what is he going to do now ?
how was the dinner . did they like the food ?
oh no ! was it at ##lea ##st fun to have everyone there ?
yeah i am happy for you , i hope things go well .
exactly , it doesn ' t have to end romantic ##ally , as long as its a relationship .
i ' m glad it went well . what was it about ?
they have their different pro ##s and con ##s .
i totally understand that . sometimes the most important charity is your own .
i like to think that if you get yourself right financially now , you ' ll be more able to help more in the future .
that ' s good advice . if you ' re not happy doing something you should spend time thinking about what you ' d really like to be doing .
even if she ' s strict she ' s probably doing because she wants what ' s best for you . and she ' ll probably support you no matter what you decide .
oh wow , were the cats on leash ##es ?
that is adorable . did they get along with the dogs ?
oh ##hh , i feel you . i also moved to a new town , last week .
work ! my boss sent me here against my will
sibling rivalry is tough .
what is your age difference ?
i ' ve seen a lot of bad breakup ##s . glad you guys are adults about it .
how do you feel about that ?
are they going to shut down ?
i hope it works out . i don ' t want anyone to be out of work .
how is that going ?
it takes some time . i wish you the best !
oh ##hh ##h where are you going ?
yes ##ss sin city . gambling is my favorite thing in life .
oh man , that sucks . were they trying to keep the trip a secret from you ?
that sounds like it would be really disappointing . are you close to your brother and sister ?
oh yu ##ck ! what was it ?
wonder how it got there .
that is amazing . i have had to use a food bank before . i was so gr ##acious .
i am great back on my feet . i just needed a little help .
what does this diet consist of ?
salad and wraps are delicious , so is water . i need to try this diet !
aw . that was probably devastating
i hope so too !
do you like the amusement park ? do you go often ?
do you like the scary roller coaster ##s ?
the girl is your wife , correct ?
that ' s a relief ! your wife is a lucky lady .
i am sorry , what did she want
oh wow , that is a lot
was she ?
ah that ##s good . . good luck
i wish you luck . you have to meet the right one some day !
exactly , practice makes perfect , especially with social situations .
she is one lucky gal . how long have you two been together ?
i wish you two the best !
hm . . . i don ' t know how i would feel about that . do you have a good relationship with them ?
well , if you did not have a good relationship then it would seem like maybe they didn ' t take you on purpose .
oh my god . what happened ?
are you okay now ?
that is so exciting ! ! do you have the ring picked out ?
ha ##ha that ' s smart , you never know . well good luck , here ' s to a wonderful life together for you two !
that ' s too bad . i bet it is hard to sleep during a loud storm .
hopefully it settled down long enough for you to catch a break .
that always is annoying
oh no that isn ##t good
that too bad . they are other work from home opportunities though .
you will find something . just don ' t give up
i ' m right with you ! i love chill ##ier fall weather and pumpkin harvest festivals ! not to mention pumpkin spice la ##ttes ! is halloween your favorite holiday ?
they really do start putting things out in the stores earlier and earlier . last year i saw halloween stuff out now . sounds like you ' re in for a lot of family fun !
that ' s really awesome . i think its great when families are finally reunited .
you def ##ini ##tly will . families are stronger together than apart .
people who take the time to help others are true ##ly angels on earth . thank you for doing what you do .
every little bit counts !
oh you must feel terrible . has sibling rivalry always been a thing between you guys ?
yep . that comes with being a parent .
what did they want to talk about
ah i hope it turns out well for you
wow ! this is early . maybe i should start , too .
when did you start shopping ?
oh that is good are you diet ##ing or doing portion control ?
oh bing ##e eating is once in a while eating a lot ?
that ' s really cool . are they hard to find recipes ?
i totally understand that . i like to make certain recipes my mother made when i was a kid for the same reason .
at least they have a little bit of home cooking to remember her by .
wow . congratulations . what did you do with the $ 200 ?
nice . what are some titles you ' re wanting to get ?
yeah ? that ' s awesome ! do you have a new job ?
sweet ! i ' m happy for you ! that must be nice .
that is disgusting . sounds like my dad though , he keeps things for months
u ##gh that ##s bad . i bet is smelled like crap too
eggs ? i can ' t stand that stuff . too many sc ##am ##bled eggs in college !
i can ' t stand the taste now . they are nasty !
sometimes that happens . were you tired ?
hopefully , you can make it up to your friend next time .
memories like that are nice
they can be helpful for sure
oh , that ' s always tough and frustrating . what kept you behind ? does it happen often ?
that ' s how my job works too . some days i find myself eating dinner very late because we got stuck behind at work . i try to just stay thankful that i have a job though ! what do you do to deco ##mp ##ress once you ' re home ?
oh that ##s sweet . . put them up this ye ##qa ##r
that ##s great . . i love christmas time as well
that ' s nice of them
maya ##be you can do something nice for them when you get back on your feet .
you sound determined . go you !
are you in college ?
really ? you should be grateful that you have such a wonderful family .
yeah you should be really great ##ful !
congratulations to her ! you must be so proud !
what will she be specializing in ?
that is so exciting you will definitely need it for school what kind did he get you ?
make sure to save all the notes it will come in handy in the future never know .
so many people don ' t take the time anymore . it ' s so nice to hear you did that for her !
she ' s one lucky gal . how long have you two been married ?
that so cool ! i am happy . what ##s did he create ?
that is amazing . maybe one day it will be more that just a science fair project .
what types of things could she do
oh wow . . talented
he was probably hungry , and thought to himself , that place wasn ' t so bad huh .
ha ##ha , you wanted him gone ? maybe he did it to spite you .
why did you quit ?
can you try out again ? or have you moved on ?
why is that
i understand the feeling
that ' s terrible . it ' s a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory .
i can understand that . sometimes one person ' s dream is another person ' s pain .
that ' s terrible . i ' m glad you stood up for your friend .
why would your friend want to exclude your other friend ? definitely not cool .
that ' s so cool ! do you get to see her often ? have you ever gotten to see her in person before or did you meet online ?
soo ##oo ##oo exciting ! are you nervous ? i bet it ' s going to go amazingly well and you ' ll have so much fun . you think she might be the one or not there yet ?
why do you feel ashamed about the movie ?
oh i see ! i guess i should watch it as well ! i never seen it yet .
why not ?
well that ' s the only way you can find out . if she says know there are other girls .
sounds like you had a good time . what pet is it ?
oh i ' ve never seen one of those . was it difficult to care for ?
were you able to find them somewhere else
time to find something else
i was too , but then i realized everyone was too and i made a lot of friends !
i ' ve found in life that all of the friends you need are right around you .
going to the park is always nice
i do too
did they receive it ?
well they will definitely let you know when they do . i would
oh what happened ?
you did the right thing . i stayed loyal to my work also and when i changed jobs , 20 ##k pay increase .

yes , good point . it ' s probably best that way .
did he get a beat down ?

does that bother you ?
i can see why that would bother you .
i bet that will be fun
i do like that food a lot
how ' d it go ?
congratulations . now you ' ll have that freedom to go anywhere you want !

that ' s nice . my job has never done that
that ##s amazing , i love to travel . where are you going ?
awesome , people under ##est ##imate louisiana , i love baton rogue
oh no , did anyone notice
i am sure no one noticed
that ##s right , you have to stay faithful to the one you love .
exactly , people just want what they can ##t have . such a bad human trait .
sometimes when we ' re in a bad situation , we do things we wouldn ' t normally do .
how much was it ?
that is pretty impressive
i wish i could look like that
sweet ! congratulations . was it difficult ?
that ' s great , you must have studied hard .
aw ##w that ' s sweet . did you get to have a party for him or anything ?
that sounds lovely . i hope your dad is enjoying his well - earned retirement now .
im sorry to hear that . what happened ?
oh no .
oh my , does she ever give it back . is it al ##ot of money ?
its hard to refuse family , but sometimes that can be taken advantage of .
oh iv ##e heard of that before . . scary stuff
has it happened more than once ?
do you feel like you interview well regularly ? were you qualified ?
then its a no brain ##er , i hope that you make al ##ot of money there .
have you gone out to try to meet people yet ? are you happy about our job ?
yes i understand its rough , some people just take time to warm up . but im willing to bet you will meet someone really cool soon enough .
oh no ! i don ' t doubt it . diet ##s make you so hungry and gives you crazy craving ##s for what you can ' t have . did it feel worth it or make you feel miserable ?
i have been there and done that . my vice used to be ice cream . then i learned about being high nutrient vega ##n and started to eat car ##bs again once i learned about nutrition . learning about nutrition made me start thinking about each thing i put in my body . like purpose ##ful eating . it was a tough transition but i never went back . just do it for yourself and don ' t beat yourself up when you mess up . i know you can do it if i can !
check out youtube . com and watch the whole foods plant based cooking show and you ' ll see the yu ##mmy dessert ##s you can eat any day of the week without guilt or bing ##ein ##g . delicious ! you take care !
i would have been upset too !

i think he was able to live a happy life while he was alive .
well that ' s a very mature decision of you . it ' s better than over spending .
no problem . i used to overs ##pen ##d when i was younger and have learned to get it under control lately .
how did you respond
that ##s pro ##ba ##by a smart choice
that ' s understand ##able , what did you do to pass the time ?
what kind of stuff did you watch ?
she sounds like a sweet ##y ! is she coming to gr ##ad ##ution ?
she must be proud .

pay ##day is always my favorite day of the week ! do you plan to buy anything special ?
ha ##ha , i love getting chocolate wasted . i like dark chocolate the best .
that ' s great , what will you do when you first see her ?
it ' s nice you have such a good relationship with her !
that is awful . why do people risk their lives and the lives of others just to get a tiny bit ahead in traffic to where there going . ridiculous . i ' m glad you weren ' t hit .
i saw a guy cut someone off next to me , fly by over the speed limit , and cut a bunch of people off . all to get ahead . then i noticed that i caught up with him because he got stuck at a light and all that cr ##azi ##ness didn ' t even help him .
why do you say that
i think you should just show up anyway
it is nice that you love learning so much . what are you studying that you like that much ?
what is nw ##o ?
that ' s wonderful . i bet she is excited .
that ' s great . i know she will do her best , i ' m sure .
that ' s great ! what is the job
that sounds like a great job
its hard to maintain that
you can get a adviser
did your dad love listening to elvis ?
we have that in common !
oh no ! so what happened ?
i hope you get an a at least then
that ' s great to hear . you must be so proud of them .
do they play instruments ?
your parents sound like wonderful people !
you ' re welcome . how long have they been together ?
oh that sounds super scary , i hope everything comes back ok
dan ##g you sound really calm about it , i have super high anxiety and would be in a state of panic ##e the entire time
what mountains did you visit ?
i love it there , it is so calming and peaceful there . except when you end up stuck in traffic in pigeon forge .
its nice to have family
they are always there
oh wow that ##s awesome
i hope it turns out well for her
oh , what ' s happening on friday ?
hope you have fun !
you have to be prepared .
is bear spray a real thing . i have never been camping
i see , is that a good thing or bad thing for you ?
sorry to hear that . well yeah , maybe it ' s for the best
loyalty is always good
i am sure they will notice
congratulations ! hard work does pay off .
what are you studying in school ?
that does sound tough , did it go well at least ?
that ' s good , at least you have something fun to look forward to now .
that is a really fun game . i wonder how they will make it better than the original .
there is nothing worse than spending big money on a game it ' s no good .
that sounds awesome have you checked out the price for lessons ?
don ' t worry she ' ll come around and you ' re so right it is better for her to start by learning to play guitar first .
lo ##l still true to this day
lo ##l . was there any left when you woke up ?
that ' s what thanksgiving is all about lo ##l
so that history can repeat itself ?
you can do that any day
it happens to the best of us
i understand that
hey you win some you lose some . what really matter is that you had fun watching .
but still maybe you learned something about it ?
oh i ' m sorry to hear that . you must be so worried .
try to get a good night ' s rest . i hope everything is ok !
that is so great to hear . nice to hear someone being happy with the important things in life and not always wanting more . its easy to miss things happening all around you if you are never happy with them .
it seems ti ##ring to me when i see people pushing for the next thing . i feel the same way . enjoy family and find what makes your happy and keep like simpler . you must have a great time on holidays with your loved ones !
what did he do ?
did he ever come back ?
do they look rough or what
i hope it turns out well for you
it ' s been raining a lot here , too , i know that feeling ! did you manage to find something interesting to do inside instead ?
being coop ##ed up is the worst . hopefully next weekend is nice and sunny for you and your friends !
i love a person of their word he is a great father keeping his word .
the greatest feeling in the world i have the same feelings towards my dad he always comes through we are lucky .
only water ? that is crazy lo ##l
did she confess ?
oh no . well at least you know she is a terrible liar .
i think we all feel you on that one !
there ' s still some time left to make the most of it , isn ' t there ?
that is very sweet
i hope to have that one day
sucks that no one told you !
it happens . i hope you ' re not too em ##bara ##ssed .
that ##s awesome . . how long has she been learning ?
keep up the good work .
yes that was an exciting moment for him and for the team as well !
i have a feeling that with le ##bron on their team , they are going to do just that .
oh wow , that is so scary ! i would be worried for my family safety , maybe get a guard dog ? my dog always alert ##s me to sounds .
good idea , you can never be too safe when it comes to the safety of your family . i hope the police is watching your neighborhood more closely since the reports .
that ' s a good thing , right ? so the families can get the help they need ?
i can ' t begin to imagine how difficult it must be for the kids in that situation . it seems the school really has their back .
what game are you waiting for ?
i used to love those games growing up so i can ' t judge you for it !
hey it ' s ok . we all do stupid things when we are young .
give it time . i ' m sure he will come around .
that is so great i love dogs they are so sweet and your best friend for life .
they come with hard work have to walk and feed them but you will get back into your groove .
enjoy it while it lasts
oh sorry to hear that then
oh no . was it really late ?
i watch too many murder shows to do that .
oh , that ' s disappointing . what was wrong with it ?
e ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w . . . the devil ' s topping . did you send it back ?
that sounds horribly boring . you can always take this time to do some house work that you put off , so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town .
you ' re welcome . i ' m sure you ' ll make it they will be back soon . you could also always watch some netflix .
what did you use the $ 5 for ? something good hopefully !
sorry to hear that . you tried at least and your intentions were good .
you will have your day
i can understand that
oh no ! i ' ve done that before . did you call them and ask for a grace period so you didn ' t build fines ? we all make mistakes like that so don ' t beat yourself up .
those kinds of things are part of life and its better for our minds if we let them go and move on or see the humor in it . i hope it didn ' t hurt your standing with the company . you just reminded me to pay my internet bill ! thanks !
was it any good ? frozen foods can be weird .
that is so annoying . you ' re better off buying fresh on the day , even if it ' s inc ##on ##ven ##ient .
are you happy for them
its natural so its okay
i hate storms .
i gee ##t scared that we will lose power .
that ##s good . . seem like a good employee
there aren ##t a lot of dedicated people like you . keep it up
if you need to take time off , then i ' m sure your company will understand .
what ever need you need to do .
that ' s great . summer classes can be tough . because its summer
well im glad for him . he must be pretty determined .
ha ##ha that ' s a smart strategy . what kind of things do you like to buy ?
oh i love seafood though . it ' s worth it i ' d say lo ##l .
what was the lie ?
were you cheating ?
why do you say that
that ##s just being a good parent
aw , that ' s so sweet of you . dogg ##os can be so reward ##ing .
is he an older dog or a puppy ?
i don ' t doubt that you ' re feeling good about yourself ! are you getting the lump sum of monthly payments ?
hey , you can ' t complain about that ! who knows , you may end up using your skills to win the major jack ##pot .
that ##s good
good for you
why ?
how come no one would walk with you . i would be afraid too .
are you able to afford one ?
good things come to those who wait , i know it ' s hard now because your friend got one but it ' ll work out for you
you should to them before you do that
well maybe should be civil
was the cake god ? sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too ha ##ha .
that sounds so yu ##mmy ! see you much have needed those cal ##ories with skipping meals . sounds like your a great baker as well .
u ##gh . that ' s the worst . have you called him / her ?
that ' s so frustrating . ask for a break on the rent next month !
im sorry to hear that , w ##han ##t happened ?
always believe in yourself , and don ##t let others opinions di ##cta ##te your feelings
don ' t worry about it . everybody mess ##es up sometimes !
it just take a lot of practice , but you will get there !
what was it
oh that ##s sweet
that is great . cong ##at ##ulation ##s ! ! ! ! did you get a big raise , too ?
it always feel good to get what you deserve !
oh ok ! is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single ?
oh yeah i know what you mean . have you tried dating ?
yeah it was very different last time i tried ! but i ended up meeting my partner through friends . you ' ll get there !
why is that
i do too , its okay
sorry to hear that . . what happened
hopefully she didn ##t suffer .
i hate that for you
i can understand ta ##t
oh wow , any special reason for him doing that ?
how sweet of him .
that ' s always so fun to see everything that ' s gone on in your life . do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture ?
they grow up so fast ! how many kids do you have ?
sounds like you are so blessed though ! i know you must miss them while they ' re away . you have been a price ##less influence on them . they will always love you !
that ' s too bad . you ' re not quit ##ting are you ?
they will get over it
that ' s a pretty wild story . why do you think the aliens chose you in particular ?
well be sure to lock your doors and windows before bed tonight , hopefully that will keep them out .
oh wow , that ' s a pretty scary movie . i ' d want company while watching it too .
i get what you mean . some films just aren ' t for some people . it takes some courage to watch .
good luck . but besides it being scary it ' s a good film in general . hope you two can enjoy it .
oh that ##s really nice , my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion , i hope u get it - u can do it ! ! !
promotions are always good more money , and a better life i believe in you ! ! !
i think that you are absolutely right ! thanksgiving is the best ! i love the food , and family . are your family coming to you , or are you going to the ?
is the brother from germany coming home ?
that sucks , did you res ##ched ##ule ?
i hate when that happens . especially when the same people do it over and over .
why would she do that
that is sad
it wasn ' t dave ramsey was it ?
ha i took a shot in the dark . i have heard him recommended a lot for people who want to learn how to pay down debt and save money .
have you found it ?
it very well could have been . i ' m sorry , that sucks .
that is terrible .
i don ' t know . they should be locked up though . hurting a person is next .
oh , that is nerve - rack ##ing . you have to be on - guard . did they behave themselves ?
u ##gh . i don ' t understand that either . and they make everyone so anxious just be existing .
that would be great wouldn ' t it ? they have it made !
yeah but you also wouldn ' t live as long either .
i know that feeling . i have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty .
maybe maybe lo ##l . . i have four dogs . . ar ##gh !
it ' s nice to have generous friends . did you have something good ?
oh ##hh , delicious .
its nice to have a reliable person like that
i am sure he will do a good job
oh cool , what was it about ?
wow that ' s nice , how old is she ?
did they have a good reason ?
well maybe you can res ##ched ##ule and do something even more fun
i am sorry , how important were they
i am sorry , that sounds stress ##ful
it ' s always nice to visit with friends you haven ' t seen in a while .
i ' m happy to hear you enjoyed yourself !
more money is always nice
that sounds awesome
did you have fun ?
it ' s always nice when an event lives up to the h ##ype . was it at a bar or a house or where ?
that ' s great . i wish my daughter was determined like that .
in the classes that she likes . it is pretty frustrating for me
i hear 35 is the new 25 !
i hope they don ' t either ! sounds like the perfect birthday celebration .
there are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home . will that make you feel safer ?
ducks are scary , but they are more scared of you than you are of them .
what ##s it about ?
o ##oo ##h all that physics makes my head spin
oh love ! i can only imagine the feelings you must be experiencing . do you have a good support system in place ?
i ' m so glad you have people to lean on - - though obviously , your experience is * yours * and no one can know exactly how you ' re feeling . are you familiar with kris carr , with your interest in a plant - based approach to diet ?
she ' s very inspiring - - you ' ll love her ! sending you all the best in healing vibe ##s , love , and light !
oh well , there is always next time
just try and keep in touch when you can
i ' m really glad to hear that ! what kind of job is it , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
oh , that sounds pretty cool . i kind of had my eye on a career like that when i was in school , but ultimately didn ' t go that route . what will you be doing specifically ?
i bet that was disgusting ! i would bring a nose ##pl ##ug from now on .
i love hiking , i can ' t imagine happening upon something so gross . would probably ruin my hike as well !
that ' s really sweet of you . i hope your cat is doing better !
well i ' m sure with you taking care of him , he ' ll be fine !
that does sound fun though
i hope you have fun
that ' s what pictures are for . are you guys ever going to live together ?
we that ' s good . the photos will keep you close
the snails ? yi ##kes . well , i ' ve always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should , and probably doesn ' t taste that bad . half of why i think it ' s probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons . so , how did it taste ?
yeah , that ' s true ! especially since you were on a cruise , it sounds like it ' s all a part of the experience . at least you can say you didn ' t chicken out . i ' m glad you decided to go that way , because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation ;
oh man , i feel for you . kids grow up so fast . do you feel prepared for it ?
i hear you . i have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday .
that sucks ? did you see anything ?
i can imagine . i had a car stolen once while i was at work . broke my heart
i ' ve never seen it . why do you like it ?
what is it about ?
that ' s great , so you enjoy looking after them ?
yeah i can understand that ! well at least they have each other , and hopefully they will grow more social together
that happens sometimes . sometimes life just gets in the way . heck , sometimes you just decide you can ' t physically do a night out , and that ' s okay , too . i ' m sure they ' d understand no matter what . maybe you can make it up to them somehow .
maybe take a few days to think it over , and then when the weekend comes , think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them . or if nothing else , just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them . they ' ll appreciate that the most .
i am sorry , i guess some friends just argue like that
i am sure you guys will make up
i love visiting brewer ##ies ! what ' s your favorite kind of beer ?
not my favorite but i had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it , i could have downed a gallon of the stuff .
oh ##hh gotta hate that friend ! what do you drive ?
i drive a gia ##nor ##mous conversion van
in what ways do you mean ?
wow they were over $ 2 when i was 18 !
wow , congratulations to him ! he must have been studying very hard for his exams .
i ' m sure he has a bright future ahead ! tell him to keep up the good work .
oh , dear . that sounds lonely . how are you holding up ?
i can imagine . but you ' ll make new connections there , i ' m sure .
i know how you feel . i moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it . i moved back to my hometown and am so happy now . i ' m sorry you ' re having a tough time . have you gotten out and tried to meet people ?
i would go with your gut . sometimes things don ' t work out , but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there . i hope you meet a best friend soon !
that is a great friend ! i ' m happy you were able to see your family .
she sounds like one of a king ! not many people are that generous .
wow that ' s really frustrating .
oh yu ##ck ! that is so gross !
i do , too . we just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees . do you do anything " green " .
if we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track .
i am glad that he did . it is always good to stay hopeful .
that ' s great . health scares are very real and scary .
i loved disneyland growing up ! did you go often ? how old were you and what was your favorite ride ?
ha ! i hear you on that . i also loved the matter ##horn ! and the haunted house . we used to spend summers in tucson with my grandparents , and they would drive us to disneyland every year ; - )
that ' s awesome ! what a nice surprise . and congratulations on graduating . that ' s a big accomplishment . what did you graduate in ?
oh , very cool . i thought about major ##ing in english , too , but decided to go a different route . i hope your new degree helps you land the job you want ! you ' re now in the exciting unknown part of your life .
just try and teach them to be more careful with them
i am sure it will get bet ##er
that ' s so nice of him to do . no one wants to help anyone out these days but i ' m glad for you .
there ' s always uber !
i am so sorry to hear that ! cancer is such a horrible disease .
i ' ve actually lost two family members last year , so i can relate . it ' s something that will stick with you until the day you die .
that ' s unfortunate . does she know that it happened ?
i am sorry to hear that . maybe next time you can just ask her .
best of luck to you . the tension and nerves must be killing you !
it ' s a tough market out there , but i have faith that you get what you desire !
i am sorry you have that . it must be rough
i can only imagine
wow , congratulations on getting a new job ! i think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job . what do you do ?
that sounds fun . have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you ? good luck and i know you ' ll do great ! act confident even if you don ' t feel like it . sometimes that can help .
ah , that ' s rough . that was a very bold move on your part . but sometimes fortune favors the bold , as they say . i think you ' ll be happy later on not having to wonder " what if . " still though , she could have maybe been more discrete about things .
ah , i see . well , it ' s a good thing you were rejected thing , maybe . at least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged . plus , this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building . the next time you ask someone else out , it will be easier .
that is very nice of him .
yes , a very cool thing .
sometimes that can be a good thing ? it ' s not always so bad !
maybe next weekend will be better for you !
i hate when those come around
i am sure it will soon
you should not feel bad , we all need alone time
honesty is great and all , but sometimes you need some time to yourself , i feel you on that tho
oh wow , that ' s great ! only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs .
that ' s great to hear !
there is nothing wrong with that at all . i ' ve done it a few times before . nobody in the theater knows or cares that you ' re there alone .
if you always wait for somebody to come with you , you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well . so there ' s that .
where are you going
oh that ##s cool
i ' m glad to hear something positive happened to you . were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off ? and what was the occasion ?
ah , pretty cool . it ' s nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time . i bet they were excited , too . hopefully work rewards you more often like that .
i would love to do that as well
i would love to go to hawaii
that ' s great ! it ' s hard to do that sometimes , especially on the weekends !
i ' m proud of you for sticking to it !
oh yeah ? what kind of animal do you think it was ?
maybe it was an arm ##adi ##llo . i get them in my yard sometimes .
oh no , what did they say to convince you ?
maybe i ' m too gu ##lli ##ble as well because that would convince me !
that is a relief . did any cow ##or ##ker friends get laid off ?
i ' ve been there . it ' s so sad , but it will get better .
maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy ! do some research into fitness and start a new journey .
one tip i tell people is that they don ' t need to change what they eat , only how much . cal ##ori ##e intake is the important factor , not what type of cal ##ories .
holy cow , that ' s terrible . i really feel for you . my dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young , and he ' s told me about it as a warning to make sure i ' m safe with ours . i wouldn ' t wish it on anyone . i hope you get through the gr ##ieving process okay .
i would definitely take as long as you need , so you don ' t put un ##hea ##lth ##y pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can ' t live up to . but if you feel comfortable with the idea , then i would consider it when the time is right . you ' ll know when that is .
that ' s great , what did he give you ?
do you know why he gave it to you ?
oh no ! that ' s not good at all . it ' s hard to dia ##gno ##se things sometimes
well i ' m glad he got some antibiotics for it . i hope that helped enough !
oh now that ' s exciting ! i moved two years ago and it was a very weird process . i was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time .
well that ' s great . i ' m happy to hear you guys are getting out of a bad home .
oh , i totally understand . it ' s frustrating when you feel like you ' re putting in the same effort ( or more ! ) and it works better for other people .
well , it ' s good that at least you ' re making progress ! it would be crazy frustrating if you weren ' t . cong ##rat ##s on your hard work paying off .
ah yes , does it bring back good memories ? nostalgia is a powerful thing .
i ' m so glad that you had the chance to make those memories with your cousins !
that sure is embarrassing , did he get talked to about his behavior ?
i agree , at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something . unbelievable .
you should be proud . these are the moments you are never going to want to forget .
yeah , but don ' t worry . more memories are yet to come !
your youthful vigor ? you think you ' re too old now ? you ' re only too old if you allow yourself to be . my girlfriend ' s 90 - year - old grandfather was a full - of - life wwii vet who lit up the room when he came in . of course , you ' re not as physically active , but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways .
well , maybe it ' s an opportunity for intro ##sp ##ection . for you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want , and what are the best ways to achieve that . maybe you need a better diet , or sleep schedule , or meditation , or an exercise routine . sometimes you have to spend energy to feel en ##er ##gi ##zed . it ' s a slow process in the beginning , but it can be life - changing .
any plans for friday ?
that ' s awesome ! i bet these next few days will fly by
i bet you were ! what kind of laptop was it ?
my husband also has a len ##ovo . he really likes it !
wow ##za ! that ' s impressive . i wonder how long until he ' s called up .
you will be able to say you saw him before he was famous !
i ' m really sorry to hear that . . . that ' s the worst scenario too , because you ' re parked and probably not even there , so you were completely powerless in the situation , and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you . maybe there ' s something that can be worked out , since you just purchased it .
there has to be something . it can ' t just be this weird vulnerable loop ##hole . i really hope so , for your case , because that ' s just unfair . i ' m sure your work will understand , but it ' s still a cr ##um ##my situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life . transportation gets taken for granted . hope things get better soon .
i ' m so glad you got to visit with them ! i know how you feel to be far from family and home alone . take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they aren ' t around .
i can see why its even harder on you when they leave . that ' s wonderful that they are such a part of your life . take care and get out with friends soon to bright ##en your spirits !
that ' s quite scary ! are you able to see who it is ?
you might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door . better safe than sorry !
wow , how long has he been jug ##gling for ?
i wonder how people figure that thing out about themselves ? very cool , though .
sometimes you just have to con ##cede defeat . i admire your resigned attitude .
then it was your lucky day . i usually follow someone like that and they will end up getting pulled over before me .
oh , no . i think i see where this is headed .
lo ##l . do you really think so ? that has happened to me before . sometimes , it ' s just too hard to pass up . thank you for sharing .
congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it . what kind of diet are you doing ?
you can do anything ( realistic ##ally ) as long as you stay consistent and take it one day at a time !
did it bite you !
oh that ##s cool then
that would really anger me as well . what did you do ? did you find the person who did it ?
yeah , it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day .
i ' m happy for you ! everyone deserves to be excited about life .
thank you very much . much success to you !
your family was being polite . if i did that my family would order a pizza , ha ##h .
it ' s all good . maybe you should try something simple like hamburger help ##er . can ' t really mess that up .
i didn ' t even know they were making another , i loved the first !
that is fr ##ig ##gin ' awesome ! i sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies .
cong ##rat ##ulation .
you had a good idea . each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight .
wow , good luck . i hope it all goes well . it sounds like you ' re confident that it will . have you done one before ?
i know you ' re do great then ! hope it brings you a lot of success !
really ? that is awesome . i used to watch re ##run ##s of that show all the time .
i will have to try to watch it . sounds like a good time
those poor dogs ! i hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately i live in an area where they are very common .
there are laws here but they find ways around them . people are cruel and only care about money .
o ##oo ##h i don ' t like owls . . . they creep me out
was it big
did you get to keep them ?
that ##s awesome
that is awesome , did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected ?
that must mean you ' re a hard worker . you should keep at it then !
i hate that . that ' s one of my biggest pet pee ##ves . that ' s such an awkward situation , because you don ' t want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop , but it ' d be so easy for them to have better manners , too . i wish i had better advice . maybe go to hr ?
yeah , absolutely . that ' s what i meant earlier , too , about being high maintenance . i don ' t know , maybe ear ##bu ##ds ? but i ' m sure you ' ve tried that . who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally , and if they actually did improve , they ' d probably just forget and rev ##ert back in a few days anyway .
wow ! that is impressive ! you must be really pro ##d of yourself !
ha ##ha ! that ' s funny ! i work out to drink and eat bad food as well ! awesome achievement with your running ! keep at it !
hey , honest mistake . obviously you didn ' t come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you . you owned up to it . i ' m sure they appreciate that more than you would figure .
i ' m glad ! it ' s the honest truth . everyone screw ##s up . and i bet it will mo ##tiv ##ate you to never make that mistake again , too . so in the end , they have someone who ' s sharpe ##r about things . good to hear it worked out in your favor .
yes dude the world is a trip , i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chi ##t chat and shake hands , you never know when someone will pass away ,
i have in real life friends , and a regular job , but because of back problems and sci ##atic ##a iv ##e made many friends online i consider to be like brothers social media has let me make relationships while in bed lo ##l
that ' s so unfair . i would complain very loudly if that happened to me !
i feel your pain . life is really unfair sometimes .
stranger things is one of my favorite shows ! it stink ##s that the next season has been pushed to next summer though .
i feel ya . the kids will be all grown up by then !
that is awesome ! he is such an amazing athlete ! any team that has him is lucky !
i guarantee they will ! that ' s raw talent right there !
wow . . so am i . . i could not imagine doing that . its great that you are going to do it though
i wish you good luck . .
oh , my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he ' d let us touch them !
i never did want to hold it , but i was curious enough to touch it ! they ' re actually kind of cute .
oh no ! i hate when that happens . . . hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
well good luck ! i know how frustrating that can be
wow , why are they still shooting off fireworks ? don ' t they know it ' s a one day holiday ?
i agree . it must be hard to get any sleep . i feel bad for any animals in the area too !
ye ##a i hear that . . . it was much better back then
that i think you are right
that is impressive . he must have been prepared well for the switch .
good for him . it takes me forever to find a job .
wow , how exciting ! boy or girl ?
yeah i ' m sure ! is this your first ?
well congratulations ! : d
wow that ' s such an awesome surprise !
that ' s a great husband and best friend
where were you at ? why couldn ' t you go home ? sounds frustrating .
oh that is frustrating . i bet you were very annoyed .
oh wow . . first time going to france ?
that ##s awesome . . i wish i could go there . .
that sounds lonely . maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates ?
i hear you . at least it is only for a month . maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things .
that ' s hilarious ! did you try to play it off like you meant to do that ?
well , at least you were honest about it . i bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again ! so , consider it a lesson learned !
it is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories . i do that from time to time myself
i am glad you were able to look back fond ##ly and remember that good times .
oh , man ! that is a nightmare ! was your boss upset with you ?
yeah , it happens to the best of us . you just have to try and forget about it and move forward .
that is great ! do you have any fun plans ?
oh wow ! that will be really fun !
what ##s wrong with your cat
im sorry to hear that . . she will be in peace soon enough .
that would make me mad . did you know who did it ?
that ' s too bad . maybe they could check security cameras for you .
time to look for one that deserves you
i hope you find happiness . . doesn ##t look like its gonna be with him . . good ##lu ##ck though !
i ' m so sorry to hear that . what happened ?
i would be heart - broken as well . you know you can always talk to me if you need to
oh no , why are all the pets dying . it is so sad when that happens .
i bet you will miss your fe ##line friend . hopefully they are in a better place now .
i would have done the same ! i don ' t like snakes
i found a garden snake in my yard the other day and despite it being little it still creep ##ed me out
that was very nice . why couldn ' t you have a baby shower ?
yes , that is nice . a baby shower , just without the people . still great !
oh no ! in ##qui ##ring minds want to know . . . is there plans for a second date ?
well , you don ' t want to date someone who doesn ' t like coffee anyway . : )
that ' s great ! how does that make you feel ?
you should go out and meet friends ! go out and do ho ##bbies that you like . i bet you ' ll meet some new friends . are you in a big city ?
who let him out ? did he run away ?
oh that is so sad . i hope you find him !
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . sometimes when you " give up " , someone good comes along
maybe you can get a pet to distract you . it could even help social ##ize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park
that is awesome . your kidd ##o will be talking your ear off in no time .
yeah i know how it is . my kids drive me nuts now . they are 8 and 9 .
man , that sucks . are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already ?
i say in that case don ' t worry about it . mistakes happen .
that should have been scary ?
nice . how did you find the city ?
it mean that you are smart .
you never know .
that ' s great ! i know that is an amazing feeling to have .
that ' s wonderful . a car is one of the most useful purchases one can make i think .
ou ##ch , i bet that must have hurt !
that could be some trauma there . . . but i am sure you will get back into the swing of things ( no pun intended ) .
that is unfortunate . did they res ##ched ##ule the picnic ?
i ' m glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week .
that ' s awesome ! how did it go ?
that is so cool . i ' m glad you found your soul ##mate !
how did you find that out ? ultrasound or intuition ?
ah i have two girls too and remember the same old wi ##ve ' s tale ha ##ha . good luck on that boy !
pretty names . mine are kaitlyn and alyssa .
that ##s awesome ! i hope the visit goes well : )
oh wow so the pressure is on to make a good impression ha ##ha
that ' s great ! good luck ! that attitude says a lot .
that ' s a recipe for success . i think you ' ll crush it .
wow that ' s a bold move . how is he getting along with that ?
that ' s great ! i think as long as he is happy , he ' s doing whatever is right for him .
that ' s great . i ' m a native spa ##ker , but from what i understand english is very hard to actually learn
they absolutely do . kids are like sponge ##d . it ' s been said that it ' s much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults
what kind of exam is it , and you sound confident you got this
that is awesome to hear , preparation will help you knock this out like a champ
that ' s awesome ! you must have felt so proud of your achievements .
that ' s good . i was never very good at math in school .
were you doing it in a public place ? weed can do that to someone .
you may want to smoke less next time . do it in mode ##ration .
that ' s too bad . have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight ?
hmm ##m . i encourage you to keep trying . even if you don ' t ge tt ##o your die ##al weight , just getting halfway would show tre ##me ##m ##ndo ##us progress .
that is so romantic . i also try to surprise my girlfriend occasionally with some little gifts
such things even though may seem little have much positive impact on couple ' s relationship
wow good for him . now he can drive you around .
he is moving forward pretty fast . but that means you can ride with him that much sooner .
wow im sorry to hear that . it sucks when something goes wrong at a job you ' ve been there long
i ' m glad you found a job quick ! that must have felt a little good to tell them at least
don ' t you hate how " customer service " has no service anymore ? did you get the ref ##und at least ?
i ' m sorry that you had to experience that . it ' s totally unfair !
what makes life so hard right now ?
very true . what would you want to do in the 60 ' s ?
why you don ' t want to join the comic book club ?
i understand . you could find a book club outside school .
oh , that ' s wonderful ! tell them congratulations for me ! you must be bursting with pride !
do they have any aspirations yet or are they just figuring out life ?
cong ##rat ##s ! time really does fly by , doesn ' t it ? what was your favorite moment from it all /
aw ##w , that does sound quite lovely . before you know it it ' ll be 20 years ! any special plans then ?
well studying is a good place to start . do you feel confident about how well you will do ?
that ' s a good attitude to have . good luck , i ' m sure you ' ll do great ( assuming you keep the pro ##cr ##ast ##ination in check ) !
hi
what did you do to protect yourself ?
that ' s awesome ! i ' ve never been to colorado but i hear great things ! ha ##ha
11 years is a long time , i hope you have a great time !
oh that sucks , were you able to get anything
wow that ' s great !
i ' m glad he was able to help . was the battery dead ?
yes , because a dead battery is much easier to fix than a busted starter or ignition switch . : d
wow that is awesome ! congratulations . i am already 31
how many people are invited ? and where is it gonna be ?
wow ! that sounds wonderful , i wish i were there too . are u wishing a special gift ?
oh man , long distance is hard .
have you met in person ?
so sorry to hear that . what happened ? is it something serious ?
i hope the surgery went successfully and with no has ##sle . i had a friend who went through the same thing . wish you all the best
hey bro . or sis . . . . . . you are talking to me now . . . . . hope it helps some .
just concentrate on the here and now . . . . . . your partner will be back soon .
did he get mad at you ?
buy him something sweet , like a chocolate cake , it usually helps .
it ' s always good to go to places that make you feel younger again , it brings back good memories .
that ##s great , never lose touch with your childhood .
that sounds fun ! what system do you play it on ? i haven ' t played mario ka ##rt since the wii .
i definitely have a switch on my christmas list ! maybe i will get myself one for my birthday .
that ' s wonderful ! i love those ' surprise visit ' o ##cca ##ssion ##s . sadly my parents would need to fly across the country to do that and it ' s just not feasible given my work schedule
oh , your situation knocks mine out for sure . that ' s great that they did that . traveling is un ##fort ##una ##tly , very expensive
ee ##ee ##k ! i can ' t watch those anymore like i used to when i was a teenager . i bet you got scared ! those replay in my mind over and over .
once , i was watching a horror movie a lo ##oo ##ong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didn ' t work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time ! it was crazy but it was just a storm outside . ha ha .
what did you do ?
same thing i guess , it ' s hard to imagine such situations .
i ' m sorry . do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself ?
that ' s true . i hope you find someone new to share it with .
wow ! i ' m actually really jealous . how did that make you feel ?
what all did you buy ?
would you like to buy me something ? i ' m just kidding . that ' s great ; you deserve it .
what even made you think about that ?
think of positive thinks instead , you have control over that .
dan ##g , don ' t you hate when that happens . what did he promise you this time ?
well make sure it is going straight to you . no drinks or smoke ##s unless you say so .
would you believe i have never seen a star wars movie ? don ' t hate me lo ##l
i am a fan of game of throne ##s though .
right ! ? one of the best shows of all time in my opinion , what are we suppose to do with our time ?
good choice , i forgot what outside is
that ' s nice . i bet he appreciated it .
you ' re a good person . everyone isn ##t so lucky .
are you enroll ##ing into army ?
well good luck , its a tough life .
that ' s a big time in someone ' s life . do you feel ready for this new phase ?
how far away will you be ?
oh man , that is a long way . do you have family visits planned so you have something to look forward to and help you get through ?
you might fall in love with it and end up sticking it out . you never know , but leaving family is hard .
oh wow ! what an accomplishment !
what kind of doctor will she be ?
oh . i don ' t know how medical school works . i am studying sr ##t history .
that is awesome , what kind of cat was it ?
that is great , make sure you pass it on to your kids as well !
im so excited for you , my friend has gone twice he said a lot of people are passed out drunk on the street , and even ta ##co bell sells alcohol very weird place
i would love going one day as well , just ignore the drunk people i bet your gonna have a blast
i just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me . so i understand
i cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet
u ##gh i hate crap like that . why can ' t credit be shared ? does it always have to be so cut ##th ##ro ##at ?
well all ' s well that ends well . i ' m sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap pl ##oy .
hey people get what the deserve in this world sometimes . just be glad justice is served .
holidays are a great time for family . i love that too .
do you get to get ##her for all holidays ?
what did they do this time ? kids are always getting into stuff .
those bum ##s . maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss .
that ' s awesome ! it really pays not to burn bridges , you never know when someone from your past can help you out like that .
i ' m happy for you . if only more bosses were like that , the workforce would be a lot happier and productive i think .
oh no , i can imagine how you must have felt when you realized . did you get sick ?
i can understand that too . . . . did you double check the bread before the next sandwich ?
that is not cool . i sure hope they fix their mess up quick !
i would definitely give them a bad review and try to speak to someone higher up .
that ' s terrible . was anyone hurt ?
you ' re lucky . that could have been really bad . did he stop ?
he shouldn ' t have a license .
that ' s a very stress ##ful time in a person ' s life , but i ' m sure she ' ll adapt !
does she have a good group of close friends ? maybe she ' s confident because of that .
growing up is hard at every stage in a person ' s life
i ' m glad you have a good plan for success this semester . did you pass last semester ?
that is really good . i ' ve found that a good schedule is the backbone of a good year . it sounds like you ' ve got it figured out .
that ' s awesome .
is the place nice ? have you seen it yet ?
well that ' s good . you guys will enjoy each other .
oh no ! how did you and your family do ? was the house damaged ?
hopefully that never will happen to you again , that is terrible .
i can imagine you are nervous . what will you do ?
well , i wish you the best of luck . i understand that is a stress ##ful situation
i have never heard of silver ##fish , but if you have to hire an ex ##ter ##mina ##tor that sounds serious . i hope you are ok !
that is really annoying to hear . i would be so furious if i was in your position .
wow that is a long time . why is it taking so long ?
that is pretty annoying for sure . i hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you .
golf ? i could never get into it .
do you play too ?
that ' s no good . what did he do ?
that is so annoying . have you reported him , or asked him to be sure to close the mail ##box ?
that ' s great . i can ' t wait to retire and travel
are you go ##ig to travel ?
it ' s always good to start them young ! hopefully they love it and stick to it .
i agree . kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise . it teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work .
om ##g that is so scary , especially if you took all your little ones with you that day
ref ##und and tickets won ##t do anything , someone messed up big and they need to be fired
it happens . maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again .
well i had to call my landlord once to get back in my place . i know how it feels .
that is awesome for your kid ! now she knows hard work pays off .
it is always a great feeling when you see your kids succeed .
wow , that sounds pretty special . are you his only child ?
uh oh , well only have kids if you really want them .
wow ! he ho ##uld ##l do competitions . i have only seen that on tv
must have been pretty cool to watch . how much do you bench press ?
i love cereal too . what type do your kids enjoy ?
oh wow , how is it ex ##pi ##ring already ?
i agree , they should check their dates more closely !
always gamble in mode ##ration , how much did you lose ? enough to get the hub ##by mad ?
if you ever need help with a gambling problem talk to someone , never keep it bottled up .
how did it feel ?
you need to get into more relationships , then you ' ll enjoy it more .
that ' s kind of rude for them not to invite you . you should tell them you were hurt .
you are right . now you know who your real friends are .
true . i think the store should introduce some policies for punish ##ing such individuals with fines
excellent . when i was visiting turkey , they had the same thing for carts used to carry your luggage
he sucks
forget him . there are soo many girls out there .
why ? is there something wrong with the day ##care ?
i ' m sorry , i think you are making the right choice .
there ' s nothing wrong with that . unless you ' re mean
maybe you sho ##ud pretend you are still at work until you get the hang of it .
wow , and you just walked out the store with them ?
oh , i thought you stole them , but i ' ve done that before too . not to that extent though .
that ##s sad to hear . do you have any old pictures of it that you could look at ?
maybe you could go visit it sometime if you have the opportunity . that would be a great vacation idea .
sorry to hear that . are you still locked out ?
well , you just have to be patient .
why ? i will be your friend if you need friends .
take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar .
really ? ? are you over - protective of your kids ?
how many kids are you talking about ?
don ' t worry . ask some help from your friends and family .
happy to hear ! have a happy home !
i ' m ready to meet my interview ##er tomorrow .
how did it go ? was it his first sleep over ?
that ' s impressive for a 3 year old ! i didn ' t have my first sleep ##over til i was 6 .
i have never had that . we don ' t have them here . good thing though lo ##l
i would have done the same .
did you tell him anything ?
well it ' s his driveway i guess .
why was it sad ?
my condo ##lence ##s , i hope you are doing alright now .
oh no ! why was it so bad ?
that bad huh ? well , i ' m sorry you did not enjoy it
woo ##ho ##oo i bet you are super excited
he should not waste this away
oh no ! can you find a different , less expensive dress ? or borrow one from a friend ?
ah , well i ' m sorry it didn ' t work out . but , at least you have other options !
friends sometimes have a sixth sense for that sort of thing , don ' t they ?
it ' s a great feeling to have so many people who care about you , i ' m sure !
cong ##rat ##s . enjoy it and keep yourself grateful . it ' s easy to take things for granted sometimes .
the bad times sometimes make us appreciate the good times even more
that ' s great ! sometimes it ' s kind of hard to save up money but it ' s good to have something saved up when things get bad
you should be proud of yourself ! good job !
awesome ! i wish i was more productive sometimes . it would really make my life easier
absolutely . if only if only lo ##l . maybe i should get a better alarm too so i get up earlier
oh , i ' ve been there ! i looked like a person who cut when i used to give a lot of cat baths ! did you clean it right away ? ( cat scratch fever )
it isn ' t too bad , mild cold symptoms usually for a few days , i hope its ok ! do you cut his nails or put nail caps on ? good for bath time .
no i have not ? i think it might be fun though . have you ?
what kind of robot is it ? what does it do ?
is it a really good job ?
maybe you should tell him that ?
what do you mean by that ?
those people need to find something better to do with their time ! get a hobby , people !
oh man ! i ' ve been there . that is hard . i hope it wasn ' t too long !
don ' t you hate that when people don ' t tell you ? well now you know your co - workers can ' t be trusted ! but maybe they were busy and just didn ' t notice - which is goo !
aw so sweet ! your very welcome . we ' ve all been there ! i completely understand . i don ' t think anyone saw : )
did they steal anything
sorry you have to live in a not so desirable neighborhood
i have been there ! isn ' t it nice to feel secure even if for a little bit ?
stock ##ing up is always good . and getting a side business in case
i bet you were really excited .
yeah , found money is always the best money .
pretty annoying je ##ez
if you were on the other end you wouldn
good work . you must be feeling so healthy and fresh .
yes , you will even begin to look years younger as well !
that ' s hard . was it a bad breakup ?
well , sometimes we lose things if we don ' t take care of them or just sometimes partners don ' t appreciate us either .
oh my , was the surgery successful ?
i agree , but always stay positive and hope for the best .
that ' s sucks , you should quit if they don ' t appreciate you .
i know , finding a new job can be a da ##unt ##ing task , but you should at least keep your options open .
you have a pet duck ? that ' s nuts !
what sort of things do you feed him ?
it is hard ! maybe they aren ' t right then . so many people are just not trust ##worthy . what have you tried ?
maybe it ' s time to move ? try church ?
which one ? was it good ? i ' ve read a decent amount of those , but i ' m always looking for more .
i ' ve never heard of it . what ' s it about ?
what size pizza was it ? if it was a large , i am not sure how you didn ' t get sick .
what kind of pizza was it ?
oh , that ' s fun to hear . what kind of class is it ? are you teaching , or a student , or what ?
oh , very cool . high school ? college ? i loved certain history classes . some were hit or miss . and i was never the best at remembering dates . it always depended on how interesting the topic was .
that is a whole lot of nutrition !
ye ##a , that sounds good . you should buy some more !
oh no , i take it that you aren ' t happy about it ?
sometimes you have to let people make mistakes to really learn from them .
cool . every ##on ##r needs a vacation . where are you going ?
the beach is a great place to relax as long as the weather is nice .
well enjoy yourself !
i bet you are excited
i hope you have fun
that is always nice when your hard work finally pays off .
now you should go and celebrate .
how sweet . . have a great trip
i know . . it would be in tri ##gui ##ng . . by the way , is it your first ever ti ##rp
hunting , fishing and computers .
i do read occasionally , do you ?
that sounds really fun . are you going to go ?
have fun !
oh ? that ' s pretty interesting ! how did it go ?
i wish you the best of luck ! i bet you did fine
i know the feeling .
well they are the one that has to deal with the consequences . . . mostly i guess .
oh no ! well they have a lot of great deals online right now .
yes you should be fine . you can get two day shipping and get lots of cool stuff .
that ' s true ! maybe check clearance ##s to stock up for next year soon : )
that ##s a sad thing to hear
that ##s good of you
i am glad ! tell me about it ?
oh is it a country property ?
how come ? is something wrong ?
oh i see , do people bug you for money often ?
i would love that ! give me that feeling : )
no not really . i don ' t have to rush but i don ' t wake up too happy usually . i am glad you are having a rest ##ful time . cher ##ish it
i have had to do this too with my best friends ( my beloved dogs ) . it is hard . i know how you feel because i have been there more times then i want to remember .
minute by minute and i remind myself that my best friend is no longer in pain .
well , it is almost the fact of life that ir ##res ##pon ##sible people will not last much and regret will be only consequence for them
i think over time , they will realize how waste ##ful and meaningless their behavior is and would start to change for better
i feel the same way ! prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states .
i hope they do . i don ' t know how he hasn ' t been imp ##ea ##ched yet .
oh yeah ? it ' s always a bit suspicious when someone just changes their attitude like that .
they didn ' t even apologize ? wow , that ' s rude . well , hopefully their friend ##lier mood will last a while .
oh no , did you end up lad ##ing sa ##fle ##y .
that ' s good to hear !
did the snake try to strike at you ?
i ' m glad you didn ' t get bit !
wow . what kind was it ?
are there a lot of snakes where you live ?
my first time was scary too !
was it a long flight ?
i bet ! my sister is happy about that too , she has 4 daughters .
that sounds he ##ctic !
that sounds really interesting ! how do you like it so far ?
that would be hard ! do you now spanish well ?
the other day someone flipped out on me all of a sudden .
nothing good . i am not talking to them again . maybe ever . too much of it . it ' s not really any fun to deal with someone who has so much baggage and childhood issues .
did you get a good look at the guy ?
that sucks . did they place you were at have cameras ?
i ' m sorry , i ' m sure you find one soon .
just stay persistent and it will happen .
she ' s lucky to have such a great kid .
exactly , we have to return the favor since they put up with us when we were little .
oh my goodness , me either !
are you going to a un ##iver ##ist ##y ?
what are you studying to be ?
that ' s interesting . a lot of cool things to learn for sure .
i bet it did !
that is understand ##able . i have to catch myself sometimes when my kids are in the car .
if people were just more consider ##ate of the other people around them . . .
that is so true .
cong ##rat ##s ! how is it going ?
that seems very trivial but do you mean that he still doesn ' t seem to know you ?
have you tried counseling , reading going through a program ? are there good things ? i know it is hard when a partner doesn ' t work on a relationship and keep it good
for sure but no relationship is perfect and everything takes work
cool . are you saving for something specific ?
i have tried saving like that , but i always end up spending it . that ' s bad
what play are you doing ?
you can watch that play anywhere to help you practice .
how many days are you looking for the extension ?
you should talk to her at least .
did she surprise you with it ?
that ' s so sweet !
wow i wish i could get my kids to do that . cong ##rat ##s
well it seems like he is starting out to become a productive person in life
is that something they can do ?
can they move in and then not actually buy the house ?
that ##s a good outlook to have ! what year are you on 1st , 2nd ?
never give up , you never lose if you never give up . you got this
that ' s a little strange
used or new ?
i can . its good she achieved her dream .
did you already make plans ?
so what are you going to do ? res ##ched ##ule ?
what were your plans ?
wee ##l you ' re not missing a concert you can go fishing another day .
that is great . you must be an excellent parent !
he must be a good student too !
sorry to hear that . . what happened ?
do you plan to look at getting another dog in the future ?
did you have a hard time in the class itself ?
there ' s a lot of people who do not so well on tests , do you get another chance ?
what medical test and why do you think the result couldn ' t be good ?
oh , sorry to hear that . hope you ' ll get well soon .
did you take lots of pictures ?
i can understand your pain . . feel the same way
congratulations ! i wish i could get a raise .
that ' s so true . i would take anything right about now .
s it because they are getting bigger ?
i feel you . my 13 year old is the worst .
did you get more or less ?
oh wow . . that ##s horrible . . our butcher gives you a sample before slicing . . i find this the best way to verify
wow , that ' s great ! you did a great thing by taking in a scared animal !
it ' s bringing a smile to my face just thinking about it !
that ' s great ! make sure to always stay with her , cruise ships are huge
lo ##l , yes stay safe and wow what an experience ! i am scared of the ocean but i know how amazing it would be though !
i ' m really sorry to hear that : ( what happened ? i ' m here for you if you wanna talk
have you tried seeing a specialist ? or if you are religious to talk to the pastor ?
wow , you should be an avid shooter ! !
ah respect for the armed forces ! ! . good luck with your new gun ! ! hope you have a blast
no way ! ! ! i hope you left the house ! ! i would , and probably would never come back
oh wow ! i would probably kill that friend lo ##l that ' s a mean prank
why ? what happened ?
oh my goodness , that ' s terrible .
does she have valid reasons ?
you should probably ask to go to couples counseling . . it works if you all are both trying to save your marriage
wow ! i hate when things like that happen . i had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch .
yeah , just keep an eye out for rust building up , but usually it isn ' t an issue .
i sorry the hear that .
you should seek revenge .
what have you tried doing to meet new people ?
sounds like a good mix of different crowds
how come ?
everyone blooms on their own time , you ' ll get there , i promise .
how old is she ? i haven ##t experienced that yet with my daughter
have you talked to her about it yet ?
i was thinking that . i would need a day or two .
does she live on her own ?
that ' s great ! most of us like our independence .
oh no , how did happen ?
yeah , i understand your concern .
how so ? money ##wise ?
i hear that
that sounds like fun but i would be scared . i heard they are friendly tho . first time taking care of it ?
im more scared about them biting me . . maybe one day ill be as brave as you .
e ##w ##w . that is disgusting
how did they " put " it there ? never ##mind . its just too much
you should still get one .
you need to write them down !
do you not have anywhere to hide your password ##s ?
cong ##rad ##ulation ##s
is this is first time ?
that must be a relief .
maybe next time you should take a taxi .
by whom ?
i can see that . . your vision is clouded sometimes .
i understand that feeling ! was it late ?
oh man ! you do not have a car ?
i know . so many bills , so little funds .
oh . that has to be really stress ##ful .
maybe you should do something legally to protect them from themselves
i don ' t know what to tell you then . i ' ve seen it before but not with me personally
oh lo ##l ! i know , that is why i only watch stuff on the computer . more control over it
oh yes they have some cool kids channels .
what was the reason ?
maybe you should try to speak with him again after things calm down .
pretty good ! how old is your son ?
yeah , you got the best son in the world !
that ' s great ! how did you go about it ?
trying on clothes is the worst . i went through a weight loss recently , and it ' s definitely worth it in the end . keep vi ##gil ##ant to keep it off !
are you talking about ones that just raise and raise prices ?
and they always get nasty with you like it was your fault and not theirs ! i feel you .
awesome ! what kind of car is it and what color ?
oh , well if you can get it soon you might want to start researching : )
what movie were you planning on seeing ?
i understand that completely , well i hope you are able to go another day that you ' d like
i don ' t think we are ready at any age to lose someone we love . i am so sorry about your grandmother .
take it one day at a time . remember grief does not have a timetable .
oh man ! i would have been so made , did you say anything to them ?
some people on think about themselves ! i would have said something if he didn ' t look the fighting type .
oh wow . . . . a grown woman wet ##ting the bed ? does she do it on purpose ?
that is weird . i ' m sorry , but she ' d be out of my house ! ha ##ha !
that was sweet of him ! were you shocked because that ' s something that never happens ?
i guess you need to go out more often so he can keep surprising you .
i know how you feel . that ' s everyone ' family .
me too . there are only a couple of people i don ' t really like and i never have to see them because they live far away .
that is great , did you study a lot for it ?
well then great job , you earned it !
it ' s really easy if you think of it as a relative you don ' t really want to talk to , polite and to the point
it makes sure that you don ' t say anything inappropriate but you still feel semi comfortable !
oh no , how long were you out of work for ?
i am sure it was super stress ##ful but i am so happy for you now and yes pop the bu ##bbly !
that sucks . i bet you felt bad . i am sure she for ##ga ##ve you though .
that ' s good . we all make mistakes sometimes .
how often do you visit them ?
that is really nice of them seems you have a lovely family , when was the last time you saw them ?
they announce a direct ?
are you a fan of super smash bros ?
do you like shakes ? where are they from ?
that is a good question , i would be scared
oh yeah what game system do you play that on ?
iv ##e never even heard of that so i guess i am getting old , google will be my friend later .
that would make me mad , do you have carpet or hardwood ?
oh , well that is a good start then !
that is great , did you offer them the job ?
great , i hope they are not just a good interview ##er , but a good worker as well !
oh wow red and blue were the best game ##boy games
never got a chance to play that one , was it better ?
sorry , i have not played it myself .
yes , they do . i do love mario ka ##rt ! i would expect the same excellence from all their games . i hope you have other games that you really enjoy .
you are going to nail it i bet . when is it ?
read up about it on glass ##door that ##s a good one online ! good luck : )
what did you say to that ?
wow , cong ##rat ##s then , glad it worked out !
it ' s failed before . just make sure you keep your hands on the wheel . . . . just in case .
that ' s cool . have you driven it yet ?
what ! that seems really fast ! did you train al ##ot ? that is amazing !
you must feel really good about yourself ! i would be if i could do that .
yeah , same thing . they ' ve done so much for me that i just feel bad doing things against them .
that ' s family though . unless they ' re straight up abusive , it ' s just something you have to deal with from time to time .
that ##s awesome i bet she will too ! when does she start ?
woo ho ##o so you guys going out to celebrate ?
are you gonna go home for the holidays ?
ah that makes sense , i love snow myself , but to each their own !
really ? i guess there a lot of people that think that as well . do you still think that ?
yes , i have an iphone now and like it pretty good too . i always had android ##s before , but i do like iphone a bit better too !
yes , it ' s very classic game .
good ! have a great game ahead !
why is that ?
i am sorry to hear that , i wish you luck !
is it fully paid ?
well cong ##rat ##s , enjoy yourself !
how old are you ?
do you have a job ?
i am also not sure about it
why do you love this
i agree , most jobs are painful but necessary .
i am confident that you will .
why does that no longer happen ?
you never too old to play catch !
who did you say that to ?
oh , better apologize quickly there !
same . . for me its because i work so much , and being a parent is so draining for me . . . i bought a new machine tho im going to start working out on friday . try to find out what ##s causing it for you , and take 1 step to fix it you got this !
one tiny baby step in the right direction and everything else will fall together piece by piece ! ! !
well , that ' s great ! what a wonderful surprise too ! i bet you really appreciated it .
it ' s nice that your parents were able to do that for you . i would have loved it too !
that is a jerk move . what movie was it .
that sucks . sorry your brother is a je ##rl .
yi ##kes , how did that happen ?
that will do it , was everyone okay ?
did you study a lot for it ?
well i hope not , i am sure you passed !
i like it too , what is your favorite game ?
i like those games too !
i was a kid then , but i remember my teachers reaction
i can imagine , that was a pretty big deal !
what happened in the past to make you so hesitant ?
i see , well keep opening yourself up and learn to let people in
oh , that sounds lonely : (
how about joining a club ?
did you go alone or with a group ?
it sounds like its scary
oh how exciting , by yourself or with a group ?
that ##s awesome , i have always wanted to do an experience by myself

cong ##rad ##ulation ##s .

what is the job you were trying to get ?
oh , well ma ##uy ##be next time !
good for you ! my husband is lucky in the lottery , but i ' m not . but , i would be excited about that $ 50 too !
you are probably like me , already figure you lost before you scratch the ticket lo ##l . i ' m glad you won !
that ' s is a really good thing , it helps build trust in a relationship .
well , that is the way the world works now days . nothing like it did in the past .
oh , tell me more !
oh i love pi ##ka ##chu !
have you considered tri ##ng to work out ?
that ' s un ##for ##una ##te .
that is bad , are there other options ?
that is okay then , but still an ##oy ##ing
wow , i bet you were blown away . where was the vacation at ?
i have never been there , but heard a it ' s beautiful .
that ##s great , that ##s how you should be
yes unfortunately
is it hot where you live ?
i get that , i am sure it is not fun regardless
no need to be jealous , i am sure you are much better than him in certain areas .
i am sure you are much happier at home than he is . . . lo ##l .
i don ' t blame you . i am always nervous at interviews . don ' t worry , i ' m sure you will do great !
you will be fine , just don ' t make yourself too nervous !
did you help them out ?
that is for sure , everyone has a pl ##oy
oh no . did you f ##nd your dog ?
i am so sorry to hear that . have you tried calling your local shelters ?
that ##s cool . i hope it works out for you
im sure it will !
that ' s a bit rude if you ask me .
i can see why . some people just don ' t know when to keep things to themselves .
that stink ##s . when did you get out ?
well , at least you got out
what did she want ?
oh ##h wow ! those are expensive i bet
why were you ir ##ked ?
wow ! what a jerk
awesome , what field do you work in ?
ha , same . are you at work right now ?
that is awesome , what is she doing now ?
well , good for her , that is an accomplishment for sure !
good luck ! i hope it goes well for you : )
how much is the house ?
awesome ! any idea what you ' re going to do with the money ?
that ' s a really good idea . better than blowing it on something now .
oh no , is she okay ?
oh great ! does she still ride ?
that ##s nice of you , what does she like ?
lucky you !
oh man . i ' m sorry . do you still have a cord ##ial relationship with your ex ?
have you talked to your friend ?
that ' s no fun . why not ?
well you can always try to make it better . maybe you should try to get out more ?
that ##s awesome , i bet they are thrilled
that is really cool
oh no ! that sounds so irritating . have you tried talking to your boss about him ?
that ' s understand ##able . he sounds clue ##less . i ' ve had many cow ##or ##kers like that , and the best way i ' ve found to deal with them is run away as much as possible .
wow , i ' d be really nervous too . but i know you can do it !
well is it after your lunch break ? maybe we can go out and have lunch , and i ' ll do my best to get you pumped up for it !
oh man , i ' m sorry to hear that .
yeah , don ' t worry too much about it . there are plenty of others out there .
that sounds like such a thoughtful surprise ! did you enjoy it ?
how come ? isn ' t the surprise half the fun ?
that is terrible ! did you get it off ?
man , i would get new shoes !
that sucks . neither did i . i know how you feel .
i ended up getting an internship then started working at the place . . . never finished the degree .
that sounds terrible , i would have cried !
i understand stand that for sure .
that ' s great , what kind of dog is it ?
oh wow i only have small dogs , i can ' t imagine training a big dog .
is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed ?
is there an hr department you can take it to ?
sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings . if moral gets too low it ' s not good for anybody .
i hope it goes well ! are you prepared ?
i think you ' ll do great !
it ' s a good way to yo keep you two together .
has he passed ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . it must be stress ##ful . everything will get better .
look into hotel . i feel into a hotel job after i lost my job years ago and not manage one . it ' s a great job . just don ' t down on your self .
i hope everything is okay .
that is a good attitude .
i would have slapped him so fast .
i would have just as mad as you are !
wow , how lucky ! i love to travel .
wow , it must be a great job . i have a friend that works for a travel agency in boston in a similar situation . she said since she started she has been to 32 different countries .
oh no , your a / c isn ' t working ? ! this is a bad time of year for that !
man that ' s awful , i ' m sorry . i hope you ' re able to get it fixed , and soon !
aw ##w man . . i am sorry . is she at least a good person ?
karma will get here someday .
that is amazing , care to share ?
i wish , one day that i could get a check in the mail .
oh no ! do you have any alternatives ?
oh i ' m so sorry : ( i hope you can find something suitable , even if you make it yourself
wow , that ##s so sad . has he been on the list long ?
i ' m sorry to hear your going through so much stress . my grandmother was on the heart transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart . maybe it will be that fast for him .
thanks , she got the heart and is doing better . wow , he is to young for this stress . good luck to him and you .
i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe next time ?
i hope you feel better about it .
that is terrible . what did you do about it ?
did you talk to her ?
i ' m sure . but it ' s a fresh start . your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want .
just be your self then . who cares what they think .
oh no , is there something wrong with your dog ?
i know words don ' t really help in this situation , but i ' m so sorry . i ' ve lost many pets and it rip ##s your heart out . i ' m sure you ' re dog had a great life with you if it ' s any consolation .
oh no ! were you prepared ?
i bet you will make it up next time .
what about it ?
that is very nice memories .
do you want to yell at him and call him a liar ?
one time i secretly called my boss ' s wife and out ##ted him for an affair he was having with one of my cow ##or ##kers . . lo ##l he never knew . .
that stink ##s i ' m sorry
at least you didn ' t damage your bike
gross ! what did you have to do ?
disgusting ! i am sorry you had to experience that !
who was it ?
im sorry they did that . that wasn ' t very cool .
surely , it was just your imagination .
i can definitely see why all those things would scare you and make you think you saw a ghost .
that is great ! it is always nice when hard work is rewarded .
well congratulations ! that is a good way to start the work week .
oh goodness , i hope you are okay .
i really understand your concern .
that sucks . i think that happens to everyone , accept the one girl who became a doctor .
try not to let it get to you . life is weird .
i didn ' t understand .
that is a great achievement . you have been doing jo ##ust ##ing for how long ?
that is nice .
oh no , that ' s messed up !
hopefully your insurance will help out .
e ##w ##w that ' s so gross .
i bet , i wish some people had better manners .
that ' s scary . i wonder if they made it .
maybe you will see something in the news in the next day or so .
wow , you must be depressed . life is short .
how is that so ?
he ##h that ' s so cute !
lo ##l ! what did you do ?
that ' s terrible ! can you do anything about it ?
wow , it sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for .
i am so happy for you .
ya ##y ! what type of dog ?
i love a nice sq ##uis ##hy face . i have a japanese chin and 3 min ##pin
yeah a lot like pe ##kin ##ese . . now you know why i have a 10 bedroom house !
has it been on the market long ?
i would be stressed each time it rains . i rented a place down state and hurricane sandy flooded our house . i can ' t imagine owning a place in a flood zone .
oh i ' m so sorry , i ' m here if you want to talk
aw that ' s terrible : (
i hope you ' re well prepared !
that ' s good , you sound very prepared and i ' m sure it ' ll be alright .
oh no , that sounds scary .
thank goodness it wasn ' t something serious .
that can be embarrassing . are you ok ?
sounds painful . i hope you didn ' t cause any damage .
that is good , you must be very religious .
that is very nice of you to help those that are needy .
watch out state farm ! lo ##l . congratulations !
that is awesome . she can drive for you now !
oh yeah . i just quit smoking myself . you should try something to distract you .
nice ! ! i ' m trying to stay away from any form of smoking for now .
they can not curt you . they are tiny and powerless .
don ' t eat them then .
he was certainly very intelligent , you can definitely increase your own knowledge though if you work at it .
try reading some books or maybe practicing math problems i guess .
that isn ' t good . what did you do when you stepped in the po ##op ?
did you throw the sandals away or just clean them ?
i guess you were pretty hungry then , huh ? well , i ' m sure your friend doesn ' t mind sharing !
well , all you could do was apologize and offer to buy another one . he ' ll get over it , i ' m sure !
that ' s nice . have you always done that ?
i ' ve never been a person of faith . my parents weren ' t either .
i ' ve never driven a truck , only small vehicles ! how ' s that working out for you ?
aw , i ' m glad you have something like that to remember him by . that ' s a great connection to him to have .
oh my ! i really hope that you find your stuff . do the cops have any leads ?
well i really hope that your insurance was able to cover what you lost .
that is great . it is always good to have some recognition for the good job done .
that is nice .
why would you ever move away from the caribbean .
where did you move to after the hurricane ?
sounds great , i ' ve never been but would love to .
how many times you ' ve been ?
that ' s awesome ! how much did you win ?
$ 100 bucks still sounds great to me !
addiction is a scary thing ! i wish him the best .
yes it takes a lot of courage to do that .
that ' s nice of her , it ' s good you have such a caring mother .
yes i ' m very grateful for my mother for taking very good care of me .
she takes care of me the best she can .
your friend takes care of me the best he can .
awesome . i was in stu ##rg ##is in 2004 . did you ride out or trailer your bike ?
lucky , be careful some people can get carried away out their .
where is it shipping from ? is it a rep ##utable store ?
yeah . hopefully you will have better luck with it .
oh no ! that sounds awful ! what a kind thing to do though ! im sure they were very grateful for your help !
i hope you took the right precautions not to get it yourself ! i can only imagine that , i have never had it and never want to !
is it an engineering job or something else .
that is great . would you be an astronaut then ?
that is very nice of you to try to help the turtles .
that is very odd . hopefully they won ' t get killed anymore .
no i haven ' t
i hate it when my team loses too . all that time invested for a loss is disappointing .
do you like your job or is this something you dread ?
well i hope you find something you love and you ' re happy to do . still searching for that myself .
which supplies did you get ?
oh that sounds like fun !
where to ? what location ?
wow , you will be fine . years ago i went to japan to teach english and also got called to duty and spent time in iraq and a few other places . once you arrive it ' s never as bad as you will have it built in your head .
i hate the summer honestly , the winter is great for me .
i love the cold . it keeps me cool when i sleep .
oh great . that is so fun . my baby died a few years ago . but he was over 14 , so .
thanks . at least he lived a pretty good long time . he was a bea ##gle mix named jack .
i ' m sorry . . my first gut reaction was to laugh a little . i really don ' t mean to make fun of you . that ' s terrible ! was it because you didn ' t want to miss a part of the movie , so you tried to hold it in as long as possible ?
the movie did ? it sounds like maybe at least it was a good movie , if that ' s any consolation . i hope no one made fun of you . it ' s a common human mistake .
i have never been to an airport honestly .
i like to stay home where i know i ' m a little sa ##ffer .
maybe tell him how you feel about that .
punch him right in the nose , that will fix things i ' m sure !
that ' s too bad . are you going to replace it ?
maybe you will be able to replace it soon . what happened to it ?
that ' s a way to make a buck ! e ##bay ?
you are my hero .
i see that more in the country i guess . that would be ho ##rri ##fying . but maybe he is just immune to pain ?
sounds like he was ok . i ' ve had injuries before and they weren ' t serious enough or worth the has ##sle of the emergency room . but he still had to take a trip to go somewhere . don ' t be afraid to care though : ) one person is all that is needed - kindness is always good !
ne ##uro ##fe ##ed ##back ? i don ' t even know what that is ! could you fill me in a little bit ? and why did you need to learn about it ?
that is really interesting . still over my head , but you did a decent job of explaining it in lay ##man ' s terms . i appreciate it . so are you a med student , or what ?
holy cow . . . that is really awesome . that ' s nice of you to de ##dicate your free time like that . i sincerely hope everything works out . i appreciate you sharing that .
oh i love looking at old photos
my niece ##s and nephew ##s are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too . it goes by in a blink of an eye
oh wow ! ! i love p ##yre ##x stuff . i bet it brought back many memories .
its funny how items can bring back such good memories .
i hope they weren ' t expensive shoes .
that ' s a shame . does your dog chew on shoes often ?
i hear you . i ' m not ready to go back either .
i ' m sure it will be ok . a new year is a new time to rein ##vent yourself .
i live in a small town with no car .
i want to get a car one day i think .
i would just go to the beach right now !
not mine at all , i enjoy my house .
i bet that was a nice surprise . why did you get it ?
you are lucky then . always good to receive things you aren ##t expecting .
i ' m in college , so i ' ll be your friend .
i wish i could be with you and not in school
did you just recently find out ?
does it upset you ? just think , the family that raised you , actually pursued you and love you .
where that happened ?
what did you call to get towed ?
maybe you should go by yourself . normally wife ##s stay at home and clean .
maybe if you go somewhere else without the girl .
oh my go ##sh i hope you were ok !
i ' m really sure you will figure it out .
maybe pray and she will hear you .
maybe she could if you tried .
adult ##ing is hard that ' s for sure . start playing it and streaming and make some money .
i just read that youth was wasted on the young . lo ##l kind of apr ##op ##os .
it ' s funny how you learn things as you get older even if you aren ' t doing major things . little things you can learn a lot from
sorry to hear that . you sound like a hard worker , which is something to be proud of , even though it ' s kind of wearing you out maybe . are you able to roll the days over to next year and save them , at least ?
that ' s kind of a lame policy . i hope you get to use them at some point , because they should be worth something . if you ' re just physically unable to because of the job and its demands , and then they end up passing you by , that doesn ' t seem fair . i hope you get to relax during the holidays , then .
i ' m sorry to hear that .
i hope everything works out for you .
i think i ' m too young for that but man wouldn ' t that be nice today ?
i ' m sure they were , i can barely afford to survive .
lo ##l . did you dare look inside ?
that is bad . i always try to remember how long stuff has been in there , but sometimes things hide on you in there .
weird . . that happened to me last year . in baltimore . .
that is horrible . . i am sorry ! mine got closed after a scandal that was on netflix
same here and its hard when your school doesn ' t exist anymore
yeah that would be awesome ! what are you going to spend it on ? ?
heck yeah ! that sounds like fun !
my weekend was pretty okay . did anything special happen for you ?
wow ! have you always fished as a hobby ? i ' ve never been .
ours is a family table too so i understand what you mean . i really need to ref ##ini ##sh it
a little . i am hoping my mother in law will be able to help me with it . she ' s done it before successfully .
it ' s worth it to keep a family her ##lo ##om
oh no , do you know why it could ' ve happened ?
so it could be something wrong with the soil ? i ' ll keep my fingers crossed for you .
oh no . did you know the spirit you contacted ?
i would totally freak out
i am so sorry . . . what happened ?
is he ok now ?
what ' s wrong ?
remember safety is the first priority of amusement parks , everything will be just fine !
hey that sounds exciting ! ! are you ready ?
yeah i would be pumped too ! is it coming with a raise as well ?
oh man ! ! make sure to put some back for retirement or emergency fund ! !
do you feel negative about it , or positive ? it ' s hard to tell from your sentence . maybe you feel both ways . if i were in your shoes , i could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation . i was always the youngest child , so i never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time . if you ' re not happy about it , hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn ' t get any und ##ue ne ##gat ##ivity .
i can understand why you ' d start to feel that way . i think it ' s good that you want to look inward instead of just b ##lat ##antly blaming other people . that means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself , that are solutions ! but nothing has to be " wrong with you . " for some , it just takes time . for others , they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with .
that seems like a short train ride compared to say , going across country or something ! are you going to be sleeping on it overnight ?
they really do feel that way ! there ' s actually a train in africa , i want to say kenya ? where it is like stepping back in time and you go on a week long journey on the train , you have to dress fancy and it seems like a dream come true .
that ' s awesome ! i bet you ' re a proud parent !
is he getting any gifts because he ' s done so goo ? !
that sounds like a lot of fun !
that is cool ! i bet you all had a really great time
was it enjoyable ?
what did you do on the train ?
did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it ?
how long did it take you to clean your house ?
that sounds nice . how come you didn ’ t go with ?
i am with you there . i hope you get a chance to go there sometime though .
i ' m sorry , why can ' t you go out ?
oh that ' s not fun .
did you ask the kid or the kid ' s parents to stop kicking your chair ?
how long was the flight you were on ?
holy cow that ' s awesome ! are we taking the kids ? ?
oh ha ##ha ! is this your first time ?
myself as well friend , i love vacation .
i do not like the beach , too much sand .
that sounds fun to go to .
i love going to the movies and getting food !
oh , why did you cheat on her ?
it ' s a man ' s world , isn ' t it .
hey that ' s good . what was wrong with it ?
that ' s pretty awesome . i don ' t guess it cost too much then .
how fun . how big was your catch ?
that ##s a big one . i bet it was scary . did you eat it ?
oh my goodness , i bet that was embarrassing ! ! !
well it happens to everyone i wouldn ##t let it keep bothering you . just laugh it off !
that is terrible . did you get hurt badly ?
were there a lot of people around ?
must be nice ! do you think he will let you ride it ?
i would be too , those things are really nice .
oh , that sounds like a has ##sle .
oh that ' s not cool , get a different one .
uh oh ! ! i hope it wasn ' t a prank lo ##l
i bet . i would be too ! was the food good ? ?
florida is so nice . are you going for work or pleasure ?
that ##s a lot of miles , but they make cars good these days .
oh no ! happens to the best of us . are you feeling better now ?
oh no ! i would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn ' t , well shame on them . i once pee ##d my pants at a wedding i was laughing so hard .
oh no ! but i think black snakes are good ? they eat nasty bugs and rodents !
oh wow , that ' s a big snake !
oh wow , what was the award for ?
oh congratulations ! you are a true hero
that is so sweet . how did he lose his leg ?
i ' ve heard that it doesn ' t bother them to lose one limb . i watch dr . jeff on animal planet a lot and that is what he says .
i ' m so sorry . i have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so i know how hard it can be dealing with things like that . i have a friend who does the same thing . don ' t be humiliated . you can ' t control it .
i hate those things ! they are so restrictive . i wish i could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her . . . let me check with her and see if she texts me back .
don ' t feel any shame . the medication is called top ##oma ##x . it supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating . i also know that if you happen to take am ##bie ##n , a sleeping pill , go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating . take care !
u ##gh ! they do that here too ! are you in a bad city too ?
did you find out who did it ?
oh really , i was unaware of that .
that is quite interesting .
that ' s great . you have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them .
i love the way carpet feels after you use a brand new vacuum on it . almost like it ' s new again .
that sounds really dramatic ! what ' s the matter ? what ' s making you so unsure about it ?
i can understand trying to ab ##ide by one ' s intuition . . . are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet ? perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you don ' t go through with it . if you want to do it , try your best to think of all the rep ##er ##cus ##sions , and to weigh the pro ##s and con ##s , and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment .
i think it ' s an adjustment you have to work through . todd ##lers can really test anyone ' s patience !
it ' s really hard , especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now .
oh ! i hear you , i love them but i get sick when i eat them . did you do okay ?
that ' s unusual . are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general ? i have digest ##ive issues so i get tired too when i eat junk food
that ' s terrible ! sorry to hear that .
so do i . people need to be more consider ##ate of others .
well , sometimes we can feel that way in life . relieved because there isn ' t drama , but get a bit lonely . maybe you can get out and meet some new people ?
well , whatever makes you happy , that ' s what you should do . but , still , never hurts to at least have plato ##nic friends : )
cong ##rat ##s to him ! what type of skating ?
oh , now i understand . he is skate ##boarding .
oh no . have you been stressed about anything ?
you sound nervous .
i don ' t blame you . it can be scary . . . the more people there are - the worse they drive . be careful !
for sure ! and always check for the wreck ##less drivers and the ones who cut you off - that ##s really bad in bigger cities . can never be too careful .
definitely . the world is an extremely complex thing , and i don ' t know if we ' ll ever fully understand it .
i would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors . they all seem to be very compassionate !
that ' s an interesting thing to know ! have you thought about doing it as a hobby ?
if it makes you feel peace of happiness , definitely !
oh hey ! a fellow bird feeder . did you eventually get some ?
that ' s good . sometimes we forget to do things that matter to us .
that ' s good , have you been having trouble ?
i ' ll say . you can appreciate it that much more . what made the difference , if i may ask ?
oh man , the flu in summer ? 1
oh gee ##z ! was it a quick flu
wow ! great wife , cher ##ish her ! stack up on good vitamin c and good elder ##berry when you ' re well to keep the flu away : ) \
oh god . . . lo ##l - i hate being sick . . . when i get sick . . it ' s bad - so let ' s hope lo ##l
that is great you showed the initiative to apply . it is common to be a bit nervous .
just think positive thoughts and i am sure you will get the news shortly
that sounds relaxing ! how was the weather ?
i love when everything just seems to work out together . im glad you enjoyed !
that is really good . in this economic climate it is good to have something like that to count on . what do you do ?
that ' s great . i am glad you ' re doing well .
i am so so sorry to hear that .
i know this is so hard for you but he is in no more pain and i am sure he is watching over you
what was the drawing of ?
you said that already , how long did it take you to draw this picture ?
that ##s exciting ! where are you going ? ?
is that a country ? i know the name but not the geography .
oh no ! ! that is awful . i hope you are okay : (
i bet . nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that . keep your head up , friend .
that sounds like fun !
oh that is so cool ! you must be a great relative .
that is awful . i would definitely not pay and never go back again .
they will lose a lot of business over that one . word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone . that is gross and i wouldn ' t go back either .
that is so wonderful ! i have the same kind of husband . aren ' t we lucky ? it gives me hope for when my daughter grows up and finds someone .
oh wow , your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8 . i already worry about it . i know they ' ll find some ups ##tan ##ding men but they can take their time in finding them ! ha ha .
glad you made it , what happened to almost be short ?
that was very nice of your grandma . how much did she cover ?
i know . it was so shocking and sad .
that was a great movie !
that is good ! why have you been feeling down about the future before ?
staying positive can be very hard , but it helps to be around the right people .
oh ##hh ! those are nice ! how much was it if you don ' t mind me asking ?
great ! that is how it should work . not one guy making a ton more , as it takes everyone to make it work : )
why are you alone ? did you just move ?
was it a significant other ? was it the correct decision ?
sorry ?
no problem ! i have done it before . oh wow ! that sounds nice , are they still together ? i hope .
understand ##able . but remember there are always private things . no relationship is perfect . it takes both working hard
congratulations ! that is awesome ! i don ' t really have much luck in winning things . have you won anything else before in your life ?
that is so cool . i have been dr ##ool ##ing over an ipad ! is it amazing ? ?
oh man , good luck ! make sure to have a book / music on hand at least to help distract you
i think that would help . is it for vacation ?
i have never seen any of the new star wars movies .
i have not been to the movies in a long time . it is very expensive to go these days .
i ' m so sorry , were they impressed ?
i would imagine they were quite delighted .
i totally feel for her . i have lost many the past year . it ' s hard
that was nice of you . having company helps through grief .
has something changed lately ?
that is a very good attitude that you have !
what was the exam for ?
when will you get the results for this exam ?
i hate the dentist . it always makes me nervous . are you going for a check ##up ?
oh no : ( that sucks . i hope it ' s only one
oh that is fantastic ! ! ! i bet you ' re proud of him !
that ' s pretty cool ! you sound like an awesome grandpa ##rent ! : d
that is cool , did you teach him how to fish ?
i am sure he didn ' t let you hear the end of that .
that sounds like a nice sunday
hopefully it happens again soon !
wow that ##s a huge pain
i know what you mean
i hope so ! i hate driving but good luck .
good , that ' s really important thing .
that ' s great ! congratulations ! that ' s exciting , and i ' m sure if you ' re confident she will , then she will !
oh , okay . well , that is a bit different , but good luck !
i ' m sorry . it sounds like you had a tough life .
i could not have said it better myself .
oh lord , why did you do that ?
you pay your gram ##ma back and stop drinking . seriously
how are you ready ?
what kinds of snacks do you have for it ?
how did he win a lot of money ?
does he play the scratch ##er tickets a lot ?
oh ye ##a something else insane ?
that makes no sense .
o that sounds delicious , any idea what you ' ll get ?
sounds delicious , get some que ##so too !
sadly , i agree with you . as i get older , it seems like that more and more . what happened that made you feel that way ?
its so true ! i battle chronic illness and ex ##cr ##uc ##iating pain daily for almost 14 years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills . i put my faith in god and pray for relief . its really hard to stay optimistic . i really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again .
that is exactly what i ' ve been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me . i just went high nutrient vega ##n 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds . i follow dr . joel fur ##hman . you can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things . take heart and i hope you feel better .
i hear you ! it ' s sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago ! i hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world
i know right < 3 . such a great time when we weren ' t the adults as well ! lo ##l - paying bills is no fun .
how were you dancing ?
were they expensive pants ?
why ? are you scared to ride it ? i can relate , so if that ' s the case , just skip it .
oh , i see , so it ' s kind of a have - to scenario . well , i always let my hub ##by do that , but maybe you ' re the hub ##by too lo ##l .
sure ! if you ' ve never ridden it , then you really should .
you are very lucky you didn ' t crash your car while driving .
yes , how much did it cost to fix the tire ?
it looks like it ' s going to be good !
me too . . . those are my favorite type of movies
oh goodness , what happened ?
oh no , you must be devastated . i ' m sorry .
oh ##h go ##sh ! what happened . that ' s so terrifying
oh , i feel sorry for you .
that ##s good , do ya ##ll live in the same town ?
my mother lives far away , and i live with my father , but its not ideal
oh my god that ’ s hilarious .
oh no i am so sorry about that . did everything turn out ok ?
oh , what caused them to move out ? is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
i see . i ' m sorry you ' re home alone . i get lonely myself when you ' re used to someone around . are you going to ad ##vert ##ise for a new roommate ?
do you have any children already or will this be your first ?
do you know if it is a boy or girl ?
that is irritating , huh . it is like a kid that can ' t stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up . ha ##ha
it just wants you off the phone instead .
i hope you didn ' t drink the soup . they better of given you the meal for free .
oh , i thought it was a t a restaurant .
nah . don ' t worry my friend ! it will be okay !
i don ' t think they will . we are the worlds greatest army
what position does your nephew play ?
is your nephew a big kid ?
oh no ! what did he do ?
yes , little brothers can sometimes be irritating . maybe ask him next time to turn it down ?
where did you go ? you went alone ?
that is awesome , i ' ve been there when i was a kid and had a lot of fun !
that is crazy ! what was your original major ?
how are you far ##ing in today ##s climate ?
that ' s not good , what is the contract dispute about ?
yeah , that ' s always rough . i would take them to court if it ' s in the 4 digit range .
i haven ' t been . i would really love to go , and it ' s good to hear such a good review from someone .
what else is there to do there other than see the falls ?
good for you ! integrity is very rare nowadays
i feel the same way !
did you cry when you were looking at the photos ?
my niece lives in los angeles . i do not get to see her very much .
that is wonderful ! how many kids do you have ? that ' s a tough job but so reward ##ing !
i have 2 kids . i love being home with them as well . i am blessed to be able to work at home . i also homes ##cho ##ol them and love teaching ! are you having any more kids ?
that is awesome ! how long were they away
i am so happy for you !
great ! what kind of job is it ?
sounds great ! better pay is always good !
that is a great surprise . i bet you are very thankful .
do you know what you are going to spend it on ?
i would not want to be in your position it ' s ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful .
it will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes .
that ' s awesome ! congratulations too ! what do you do ?
oh nice ! my brother in law is a lawyer and i remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes . sounds like you are a great lawyer . hope it goes well for you !
wow cong ##rat ##s ! what type of music do you play ?
nice , i really like folk music . i hope you guys put off a great show .
oh what a scene . how did it make you feel ?
you are so lucky to have a family like that !
oh my lord , please say that ##s not true .
that is one of the most horrible things iv ##e ever heard .
i would be mad ! did she say why she didn ' t bring you anything ?
maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit . i ' m sure there is a reason .
aw i ' m sorry . why are you lonely ?
maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie ?
maybe you could face ##time your wife .
that sounds really frustrating ! who mo ##ws their lawn that early holy cow !
wow i would be mad to .
gee , that is too bad . i wonder why becky got it and you didn ' t ?
yeah , that ' s no fun . maybe you ' ll get offered the next promotion that is available ?
what day is that ?
oh lord . . that gives me chill ##s just hearing the word . what was it on ?
do you have more than one dog ? ?
i feel like this is obvious , but is he white ?
that sounds awesome ! i ' ve only ever been to florida in order to get to disney world . are you there to visit family ? business ? to sight - see ?
yeah . . . i had to do a long drive from nebraska to colorado this summer . it was about a 7 - hour drive . that was starting to push it . so , i could see 9 hours being a little rough . i just tried to load up on podcast ##s to listen to .
oh that ' s awful ! i hope he is going to be okay . did they lay him off with severe ##nce or anything ?
yeah . he will get to spend more time with you all now ! take the father on a vacation !
i lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed ?
now that was mean and cruel nothing funny about that best outcome is you are fine be careful next time .
oh boy . that ' s no good . did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too ?
i bet . i can ' t believe they didn ' t alert you . were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account ?
oh goodness , is she okay ?
i really wish the best for y ' all . good health .
that was nice of him . you should take him out for dinner .
that is impossible thou . it is a dog eat dog world out there .
congratulations . do you have any party planned for this event ?
that is cool . are you going alone or with friends ?
you shouldn ' t let those kind of people upset you .
maybe you should move out ? have you thought about that .
oh ! yeah i understand that , maybe they will take you ? !
oh yes of course ! i am sorry .
that ' s so nice . is he doing better now ?
i ' m sure it was a great comfort to you . food is a great way to tell someone you care .
that ' s great . my mother is like that too , and it ' s easy take for granted , but not all are so lucky !
you sure are ! at least you appreciate and acknowledge so i ' m sure she is pretty glad to have you as her child .
yes , all the time ! my girlfriend always thinks i ' m so weird .
i ' m sorry to hear that . we all have our demons . sometimes it ' s good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive .
good to hear ! what is the subject ?
that ' s something to be proud of ! good job !
i ' m not sure what that is . tell me about it ?
oh , okay , i believe i know what you are talking about now . he is a good actor and usually his movies are great !
i hope you wasn ' t to disappointed was you to going to spend time together ?
a simple call would have been nice hopefully he has a good explanation for this .
can you really put a price on pizza ?
i understand , if a pizza is more than 10 dollars , im not paying .
that must be so annoying .
i ' m sorry , maybe one day when he gets older .
oh no ! i hope you didn ' t have to go anywhere the next day ? did you try anything to help ?
oh , well that ' s a bonus ! no one needs sleep on christmas lo ##l
can ' t you just live with someone ?
well , dogs are good for protection .
that stink ##s . did you hurt your foot ?
i read that wrong , i thought you said you tripped over a vase and it broke . will you be in trouble if she finds out ?
oh no ! its always tough in relationships but when you can ' t go see her or make her talk to you afterwards , i ' m sure its extra hard . did you call back and tell her that ?
i ' m sure once she calm ##s down , she will look on it as not as big of a deal . if you have to work , you have to work . i hope you can work it out !
ha ##ha ##ha . i ' m so sorry , but that made me laugh . i really don ' t mean to make you feel like i ' m thinking you ' re dumb , because i don ' t . everyone makes that mistake . i have an old honda civic , and i run into that problem , too . you probably gave the locks ##mith a good story to tell , and made his day . hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow .
oh man , he didn ' t charge you ? you both kind of won then ! a good story for you both at no cost . well , except for time . it was a good learning lesson . and yeah . . the bumper stick ##er . . that ' s crazy . i ' m glad you ' re able to not take yourself so seriously . that makes for a great personality .
oh , well , i guess that was a bit disappointing huh . well , maybe you can go real soon .
oh , well , you ' re going to have to say , " mom , i know you ' re tired but i really want to see this movie , can we please just go ? it ' ll be fun , we need time together " .
i understand . tell me about it .
yes , one day at a time .
woo ho ##o ! what were you promoted too ?
that ' s great ! what kind of tasks do you do ?
that ' s an interesting way to get attention . what spurred that on ? was it a dare , or was he just feeling wild ?
interesting . . did he get in trouble ? was this at a high school or something ? and does he take gymnastics ? ! back flip ##s are hard !
do you guys fight often ? ? how do they usually turn out ?
are your political views the same ? and do you think this next fight will end well ?
i ' m really sorry to hear that . what ' s worse is the best thing for breakup ##s , the only thing that really helps , is time passing by . but the people who are hurting , in the moment , they can ' t really understand or accept that . so , you feel like you have to help and do something , when in reality it ' s probably best you don ' t sm ##oth ##er them and that they have space . i hope she feels better , though .
yeah , that ' s a good idea . that ' s always a solid way to go about it . my roommate had a breakup 6 months ago . i tried not to give any advice that was too specific , because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves . my roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible , diving into artistic endeavors , trying to work out , etc .
that is disappointing . did you confront them about it ? i am sorry you have to deal with that .
that ' s too bad . lesson learned , i guess .
that sounds stress ##ful ! how far did you move ?
that ' s quite a ways . do you have any ho ##bbies that could help you meet new people ?
well , that ' s wonderful and i know it really is so great to hear your child ' s first words !
for sure . before you know it , he ' ll be saying full sentences !
that is always true . the saying goes . . water your own grass .
find some good books and good therapy and make your life what you want it to be . if you truly love your partner then don ' t lose them over feelings . feelings are fleeting .
yeah , i do . i ' m in a long distance relationship . i get that every ##time i have to fly back home . i hope you start to feel better , though . loneliness can end up being a good mo ##tiv ##ator , however .
ah , your situation sounds complicated . i ' m sorry you have to deal with that . it sounds like you ' ve given a lot of thought though , and the way you lay it out , you sound very mature about it . you ' ve developed a good perspective on it , one that i should learn to appreciate myself . with your temperament , i ' m sure you won ' t suffer from loneliness very long . people will want to be around you , as long as you want them around you .
you sound like you ' ve dealt with more hardship than the average person . i wish i could em ##path ##ize with you , but i ' ve been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently . but i do hope things will turn out differently for you soon . if anything , these things will make you more res ##ili ##ent than the average person , too . that ' s not worth nothing .
do you feel their weight ?
sounds exciting . will you do it again ?
are they usually a winning team ?
oh wow , i hope they do well .
wow , that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff . what took you out of the country ?
a two month vacation sounds amazing ! i figured it was for work or something when you said two months . what is your favorite thing to do in the bahamas ?
that is wo ##rri ##some but also exciting . is it your first child ?
congratulations . i wish you the best of luck . parent ##hood is a blessing .
that sucks , how old was the gold ##fish ?
what did you do with gold ##ie after she died ?
aw . i bet that is so bitter ##sw ##eet . do they graduate next may ?
that is a good sign ! i know many kids that age who have no direction so it sounds like he ' s really going places . do you have any other kids that will still be at home ?
what is the certification exam for ?
my father was an architect . so i have heard about these exams .
i hear you ! life is so busy , never enough hours in the day !
oh lo ##l ! it ' s ok , you are a mom and it ' s the hardest job ever and very thank ##less . you are doing good
yes i do hate being all alone . that ' s how i feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work .
yes you have to do what is best for yourself . take care of you before others .
right on , that sounds cool . did you go with family , or a date ? or maybe just hung out there alone ? that ' s okay , too . i love italian food , had always wanted to go to olive garden , but my dad hates italian . so when we were growing up , we just never went . now that i ' m on my own , i ' ve been . . . twice . both times , they were just okay .
it can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal , with the deals and coup ##ons they have , i think . with the bread and soup you can get . i hope you guys had a good time !
i ' m sorry the hear that . maybe another company would appreciate your talent .
the first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings .
just take your time and don ' t get so nervous you got this .
great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy .
that ' s ok . employers don ' t look at your grades i don ' t think .
it sounds like you have determination , and that is worth more than a 4 . 0
yeah it should be a good one . who is your favorite team ?
hope da ##k has a good year ! i am all about the tail ##gating .
that must have been somewhat weird .
oh goodness , that is so creepy !
that sounds so exciting get ready for sleep ##less nights and long nights gambling .
know your limit once you start gambling it will make it much easier so you won ' t go broke .
i ' m sorry , but i don ' t envy you . . . i ' ve always just driven a little sedan . i ' m an alright driver , but if i had to drive something bigger , i ' d be nervous , too . too easy for me to make mistakes . i kind of dread the day where i ' ll have to drive a big uh ##au ##l truck . i hope things go well for you , though .
well , as long as you ' re patient and careful , you ' ll minimize your mistakes . there are those who go out there and think they know everything . even if they ' re a good driver , they may be more likely to slip up and have a problem than you would . so , just stay positive !
maybe you can observe what she ' s doing and use that to advance in the industry as well .
i ' d be worried about having these kinds of feelings towards your wife .
that does sound creepy . what did you do ?
clown ##s are scary . did you make it out safe ?
oh that is pretty cool . were there any clown ##s there ?
that is good to hear . i like the ones that are funny better .
did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown ?
that is good to hear i would enjoy a night with some great music .
that sounds scary ! what was it ?
oh no . are there other people at home with you ?
that was nice of them . what movie do you want to see ?
you should see 8th grade . nice story about a girl growing up . you will like it .
that is very impressive . do you know what languages they are ?
wow , i bet chinese is one the state department really needs right now . i hope your friend gets the job .
wow . you can wear yoga pants to work ? i ' d like that dress code !
ah i ' m glad that ' s over for you then . now you ' re less likely to forget doing laundry again .
oh no , are you worried about her ? do you think she will be faithful ?
yes i agree , guys are a little let reliable sometimes .
wow . that is impressive ! i can ' t even do a cart ##wheel on a mat .
maybe she is part kangaroo after ##all .
that
ah - hem ! what i meant to say prior to my keyboard mal ##fu ##nction was . . . that sounds really neat ! where are you going to go camping ?
people really need to be more respectful . what did you do ?
he deserved it , that sc ##umb ##ag .
that is scary . i hope she wasn ' t too shaken up from it .
that is very true . well i am glad she is ok . thanks for sharing about it .
it must be nerve wreck ##ing especially since it has so much imp ##ack on your job .
try to stay calm and do your best . good luck !
that sounds exciting ! when are you going ?
it ' s good to focus , but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture . china has a long and interesting history .
i hate that !
ha ##ha ##ha . . . aw ##w . . can ##t give away the pup ##per
that ' s too bad . what ' s your favorite dish ?
those are really good . i am more of a burr ##ito man myself .
that ##s amazing ! where did they take you ?
you are very lucky , is greek your favorite food ?
that is awesome . did you get to do anything fun with her ?
cool i like harry potter . you have a really nice aunt !
congratulations ! any plans to lose more ?
that ' s great . were you losing for a special occasion or just to feel better ?
oh . . i am so sorry to hear that my friend . . i understand your feelings . have you thought about getting a new pet ?
i feel you . . when my pet dun ##ken passed away , i got a new dog , named him dun ##ken and restarted our relationship from there
that ' s awesome ! and crazy . . . and scary . . . and awesome all at once ! you must kinda feel accomplished though , huh ? good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy . kind of weird how you all will have that special , unique bond for the rest of your lives , now .
it ' s funny , you guys walked into work that day and thought it ' d be another usual , boring day . you clock ##ed out maybe with some blood on your shirt , smelling like newborn . awesome .
wow . i definitely would take it up wi ##ht your credit card .
they really should be more consider ##ate . all ##er ##gies are a serious medical concern .
what happened ? did you ask her to go out on a date ?
yeah , that happens all the time with me . well , actually , it doesn ' t , since i can ' t text because i wear hulk hands all the time . i just smash things .
wow . why did he do that ?
if he wasn ' t happy with the food , there are ##bet ##ter ways to tell you .
not sure what an em ##u is . i hope you find him / her !
maybe she just wanted to go play . i hope she comes back .
that really sucks . that would have been an instance to cry over spilled milk indeed !
never thought about that . thank god you recovered it !
that is awe ##som ! ! !
ha ##ha ##ah . . . that ##s too cute
aw , that ' s so sweet of you . did it work ?

i would be really angry
sounds impressive . did you finish all of them ?
that ' s really good ! did they give you a raise ?

that ' s really great . i am proud of your success .

i think you can do it ! i mean is there really a limit to the amount of big ##mac ##s one can eat ?
oh that sounds wonderful ! are you going to visit the zoo ?
i here they have one of the best zoo ##s in the us .
that ' s really bad , but really good that your faced didn ' t turn out scarred for life .
true . it is quite terrible to have ac ##ne . mine is so bad that i can ' t even see .
that ' s so nice of them . was it your birthday ?
i ' m glad you had such a fun time .
aw ##w ##w that ##s good news !

i am happy that you had a great weekend . i should really check it out myself sometime .
wow . it can be difficult to put together but finding the parts is a lot of fun .
i think if you show that you put in some effort yourself first she won ' t mind .
wow . you were either very imaginative or upset .
thought that reminded me of death note , but i think l only focused on criminals .
that ' s kinda bad . what did you lie about ?
well , i suppose it is justified as long as you don ' t do it all the time .
that ##s good . where did they find it ?
is that how much do ##rito ##s and a mountain dew costs there . gee ##z
that ##s the same thing happening at my job , super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying
yes it does , i wish people like that would just get fired

so sad to hear that . . i am so sorry about that buddy . hope you feel better
ha ##ha , f ##oids am i right ?
yep , hyper ##gam ##y is a real killer
that ' s always so annoying , especially when they over ##ea ##t and waste food .
my cat does that all the time so i feel you .
sounds awesome ! we have a fitness center locally that offers tan ##ning beds and massage ##s . i was thinking of joining just for that .
i wish you luck and make sure to stay hydra ##ted .
that ' s awesome ! i love hearing stories like that .
hopefully the pizza is just like you remember !
sometimes it is nice to look back .

why did you get a ticket then if it was for no reason ?
that ' s absurd ! too bad there aren ##t any cameras around to prove your innocence !
you don ' t like roller coaster ##s ?
i think they are tons of fun !
that is a very good wish to have buddy
true . in other words you want to make them financially stable
i never leave my house ! much less play sports !

i never even carry a wallet any more !
i just use the back of my phone , which holds my cards .
i know , they have so much talent too !
unfortunately , i have gotten used to it .
what did you do about it ?
i would not have done that , did he hit you ?
what are you saying ?
i can ' t believe this ! are you serious ?
what type of project is it ?
i do all of my business digital .
that makes sense , since your feet are likely gonna smell too .
i guess just take a spare pair with you !
i could not even imagine how you would have felt .
i do not like to be sad .
i sure hope so . it is making me a little blue .
yes i agree . i have flowers and they need sun and rain .
i have already done that and it is usually so de ##pressing .
it ' s good to get everything you need but i hate school in general .
i understand that com ##ple ##tly , i also do not have a car .
one day you will own many cars .
oh wow that ' s lucky ! so they are paying for everything ?
hopefully you get there then so that you can repay them !
that is truly magical .
i would never ever cheat on anything !
w ##th that ##s crazy
you should john wi ##ck them
i keep my money in the bank , never in a wallet !
i understand , you have to go and get another one .
do you ? me too ! which one is your favorite ?
oh . i thought you said " like " at first . i ' m sorry . i like them ! you should try watching more of them !
i have never been , but i would be very unhappy about it .
i would be careful , it might break any time !
that ' s good to hear ! what kind of car is it ?
what brand of car is it then ?
i think in person would have been better !
sometimes things are much better face to face .
i do not drive at all , i stay home .
stay indoors and no need for that !
oh yes , i love ta ##co tuesday !
that must be a proud tradition .
nice ! where are you goin ?
that sounds fancy . i like texas , never been there though .
i dislike football , very much .
i ' m sure he will do great things for you .
aw ! how come ?
lo ##l what does that mean ? you should find a good hobby !
that ' s great ! how much did they win ?
that ' s good . i bet he was happy .
oh that ' s exciting ! have you gone before ?
that ' s true , the experience is different when you ' re older .
trips are very expensive to go on .
food is so expensive these days .
so sweet , it ' s good to have pets with us .
have a happy life with your pets and enjoy with them .
i only like american food !
food is the gateway to the soul .
i am sorry to hear that . i hope it wasn ##t a bad break .
wow , that is a slap in the face .
oh wow that ' s really exciting ! you must be really happy .
that ' s great to hear , i hope his first day goes well !
oh that sucks , i guess you called in to make up a lie and make up the quiz
cool , , that ##s great
that ' s good to hear . what subject was this in ?
math is the worst sometimes , especially when you see the test and panic since you know nothing .
oh no ! i ' m so sorry to hear that . was anyone hurt ?
i know it ' s hard to lose your stuff , but it can be replaced . at least you are ok .
oh no ! did they rei ##mb ##urse you ?
i ' m sure it is . i would be furious !
wow , cong ##rat ##s on my behalf .
it ' s lovely . be a happy couple . live long together !
oh no ! did you call the police ?
was it an accident ? or on purpose ?
why were you surprised ? is he shy ?
some girls like a certain type . or maybe it was written in the stars .
that ' s so sweet ! i bet he is an awesome dad !
this is true . did you have some good memorable times together ?
that ##s good . i ' m glad to hear that .
oh cool ! where are you gonna do that ?
oh yeah they are safe 99 % of the time
aw i ' m sorry . can you re ##take the class ?

wow , hopefully next time it may taste better !
that ' s a wonderful thing to hear ! did you get through college ?
i bet they are ! you should take them out to dinner to celebrate !
you ' re welcome and cong ##rat ##s on graduating ! that ' s such a great accomplishment !
nice ! where are you going ?
that should be a good trip for you . ever been there ?

5
o ##ops . i didn ' t mean to type 5 lo ##l . i hope you get to take breaks to go see your cat on the weekends : (
did you watch them with someone special ?
aw that ' s sweet . i ' m sure they loved it more than you know .
oh really ? does it make you anxious ?
that ' s a bad outlook , you should stay positive !
oh no . what grade did you get ?
that ##s great i happy for you . its a positive step .
why ' s that ? something important ?
oh wow that ' s exciting ! i ' m happy for you .
aw ##w . how do you feel about that ?
yeah i bet . hey at least you ' re out there trying . that ' s all you can really do .
me too ! i like to win , i guess that makes me competitive .
it is a good thing , it gives you an edge .
oh ye ##a ? when is the trip ?
i bet you are going with a loved one that ' s why you are so anxious about the trip
oh ye ##a did you do a good job to get one ?
that ##s great nice job
why what happened ? hopefully nothing bad .
don ' t worry , i ' m sure you did fine .
i know what you mean , that has happened to me before and it is an awful feeling .
it probably isn ' t , i really hope it isn ' t too .
sorry to hear that . what did your friends say ?
hopefully your friends make it up to you !
yeah isn ' t that awesome ! what kind of dog do you have ?
aw ##w that ' s so cute ! does he do any tricks ?
he ##he how adorable ! give him kisses for me !
what is your test about ?
oh nice , i worked at a pharmacy while i was in high school and i loved it . i thought about getting that certification . is it hard ?
wow , that is such a special occasion ! what a gift
because you witnessed it .
oh that ' s exciting ! are you gonna propose or what ?
that sounds so nice , i wish i had a long term relationship like that !
oh that ##s good
it ' s always a good thing to turn things around
was a happy shocked feeling or a bad one ?
that ##s great . where was the trip to and who with ?
oh really why is that ?
oh dan ##g that ##s a real think ##er
i know that feeling . i get it when i feel anxious .
have you tried yoga and meditation ? it can help .
oh no , so sorry . was your son okay ?
that ##s so unfortunate . i hope he learnt he ' s lesson . on the brighter side is that your son is okay .
why is that ?
sounds super fun
oh that ' s awesome ! where you going ?
cool ! i ' ve never been there . are you excited to go ?
that sounds terrible . i would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel .
that ' s good but should also be standard for any hotel , nevertheless a 5 star one . how was the new room ?
you must have been rather disappointed . but its the thought that counts .
true , they only want the best for us . sometimes that can mean making hard decisions , such as fore ##going the bike .
oh cool ! what job does she work ?
that ' s really nice ! glad to hear that she is moving up the ladder !
if it ' s someone you know you should ask them not to do it again
oh that ##s bad !
i bet they will . that ' s the way to look at things . with some optimism !
yeah . well i wish you luck my friend . keep your head up !
oh ##h that ##s nice . may i ask what for ?
what an amazing women . she must be very strong .
i ' m not one to judge . we all have done things we regret in the past . why did you do it though ?
well i guess you learnt a valuable lesson , just don ' t do it again .
ye ##a i know what you mean
ye ##a it sucks to think it might fail
wow , that ' s really nice of your father ! what type of car did he get you ?
that ' s nice that you can depend on your father .
oh my , what movie was it ? !
you must have had trouble sleeping that night !
sounds like trouble . what did he do ?
thanks that was very helpful .
so sad
it is alright
i ' m glad that i don ' t have to deal with any of that for a few more weeks of summer vacation .
well i hope that you do well on that exam !
wow i can relate , feels goo ##f knowing you will do well so you can not worry about it
ye ##a exactly
nice
really ?
i bet . that is always a tough situation .
are you still civil with them ?
congratulations ! it must be exciting to live on your own !
it ' s nice to have company and make close friends during college .
oh that ' s always nice . what made you feel that ?
aw that ' s funny , i always love those kinds of heart ##war ##ming moments .
i can imagine it can be stress ##ful !
yes , and fortunately you will have many more !
aw ##w ##w how cool . what was it ?
that sounds very cool !
aw that ' s annoying when my cat does that too .
especially when they seem to do it in the worst place possible .
ye ##a i know what you mean , austin should share
ye ##a exactly
that ##s awesome . b is great and you ' ll smash it next time .
i guess to keep on trying and don ' t be so hard on yourself , a b grade is good enough too .
give me an example of something that happened then .
i know what you mean , i ' m really really shy too .
sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming . there can just be too much going on at once , especially if you have more than one child .
you just have to do what is best for you and your family . one day your kids will understand , especially when they have kids of their own and have so many other things going on .
that is a very good achievement to hear
what do you do for you to become the best employee ?
that is true
med ##ics are life save ##rs , so you must trust them with your life
which class was that ? i ' m glad to hear that .
i ' m about to go into that same class so i hope i do well too .
ye ##a i loved doing that all summer
same , its quite cool
that ' s great ! what job did you get ?
that ' s the same kind of job that i ' m looking to get , so that ' s awesome !
you need to wipe away the guilt and seek forgiveness for yourself .
yes stealing is a bad act , but now you have learned your lesson !
oh no ! what had happened to you ?
that ' s a tough situation . i hope you are able to make the best move for you .
me too i love them and i am very excited as well
i know they ' ll make so much money from it within the first week of release
i know what you mean i wish i had either
ye ##a i know , my friend max has that too and i would like a girlfriend but its tough
that ' s so painful . i hope it didn ' t hurt for too long .
i know what you mean , it can linger sometimes .
i know how you feel
that ##s an un ##hea ##lth ##y way to think but its hard to avoid
that ##s not nice for you . did you try meeting people ?
i know exactly how you feel as i ' m one too . keep at it though as deep within us , there ##s a great spirit there .
did you enjoy it ?
what was the movie about ?
it ' s excellent . my heart ##y cong ##rat ##s to you !
have a excellent career ahead to you ! !
i agree , nothing like seeing them smile and have fun !
yu ##p . enjoy it whilst they ' re young !
that ' s great , i don ' t pray often because i ' m not too religious . . .
yes , count your blessings because there are people who do not have it as good as you
did you start to feel a bit lonely ?
that ' s tough , but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own .
stolen ? that ' s horrible !
i really hope so too , whoever did it is an awful person .
that ' s precious . how old are they ?
they are really starting to grow up , you better cher ##ish them while you can .
sorry dude , that ##s rough . do you know why she did that ?
women . keep strong dude , there ##s someone out there for you .
oh ye ##a i know what you mean
it really does feel bad tho
it ' s important to spend time with your friends while you can !
make some good memories and enjoy these next few weeks .
great , i bet he did a good job
i know , it ' s probably because you are related
i agree , people who do animal cruelty should be in jail .
yes , we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools .
wow , really , what was the result ?
really , that is excellent , you are a genius
oh no that ' s too bad , it wasn ' t your fault at least .
yeah , just make sure that you aren ' t in too much of a rush like that .
really ? cong ##rat ##s
that ' s a cool ride
that is nice . did she like it ?
that is great .
don ' t upset for her . may be she isn ' t worth for your love .
yeah , i can understand your feelings for her .
oh really ? why do you think that is ?
aw i know that feeling since i had a big brother .
ye ##a i know how you feel
ye ##a i hate clown ##s too
sorry to hear that . that must have been lonely .
hopefully you can make new friends and explore new places with them !
did you return it ?
did the get mad at you ?
oh my , were you rushed to the hospital ?
i can see why . are you alright now ?
really ? what happened afterwards ?
i hope you didn ' t hurt yourself
me too . its always fun during christmas
that is true
don ' t feel bad for the opportunity that you have . life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot .
i ' m happy that you have this opportunity in life . keep at it and be thankful for it .
same , i can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason . it is amazing how bad it smells in one of those !
yeah , pretty much all humans would rather smell good things than bad lo ##l . i hope you can get over this ph ##ob ##ia though as i know how it feels to just des ##pis ##e something .
that is a slap in the face .
it happens to the best of us
what job did you apply to then ?
i ' m sure you ' ll get the job , buddy !
so exciting ! what did you do with that money ?
that ##s good ! i would have just spent it on drinks !
really ! that must have bee so frustrating for you .
jealous ? not sure why your jealous of somebody being inc ##ons ##ider ##ate .
you always hope that is the case . sounds like it didn ' t turn out well . i ' m sorry .
that ' s terrible and really not fair to you . i feel so bad you had to go through that .
well good luck and i ' m sure you will .
your very confident . i guess that ##s a good attitude to have .
i wish i was more like that .
you must be prepared for anything then .
oh really ? that must sting
ye ##a i can see why you would be
you must have been disappointed . did you ask why you didn ##t get it ?
i would be too . but there will be plenty of other opportunities !
why are you nervous ?
really ?
ye ##a i agree with that
ye ##a its not much ##t ho
you must have been disappointed in that ! was it an important class ?
you will , you need to keep at it !
that ' s so inspiring ! how did he do that ?
oh wow , what a claim to fame !
i know what you mean , it ' s the excitement that keeps you up !
i would always try to sneak a peak of the gifts when my parents were not looking .
i know right . did your mum ask you to see if you wanted it also ?
oh no . i ' m sorry . families can be tough .
why ?
that is true ?
to whom did you give instructions ?
did you feel powerful giving instructions ?
excellent , you must feel proud of him as well !
as you should be ! it takes a lot of hard work .
did you talk to her ?
it is nice that both of you still share good memories .
i hate it when that happens . where you doing anything important when it happened ?
making money doing what ? i hope you got it all sorted out though .
that ##s great you should feel proud
that ##s pretty sweet
well done to you . not everyone has that type of focus . what where you studying for ?
that ##s great . did you ace the test ?

financing can be scary but a lot of places now have really great rates for auto loans .
that sounds like a plan . it make take a while though to save that much so just be patient .
i am not a fan either
i definitely agree
sorry for that . i hate last minute cancellation ##s . did he have a good reason ?
who needs friends like that . so what did you do ?
why ?
i understand . i have the feeling . most people are now looking only for their interests .
that ##s great isn ' t it . i hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen .
i ' m happy for you that this new manager is better . it just makes working a whole lot better and more enjoyable .
i like secrets . did it turn out the way that you hoped it would .
it was nice that you had him to turn to for help .
you must have been rather surprised . did you thank her for it ?
what a nice person . you should throw a party for her !
what are you studying
that does sound nice
you must have worked hard for it ! you deserve it then .
good . hopefully you continue to prepare well for the future challenges .
sorry to hear that . that is bad . what your manager did say about it ?
that is ok if they understood the situation . it will be fine .
wow what a horrible thing to walk into !
i hope it was fixed that day
any good emotions
those are nice feelings to have
oh my , why was she arrested ?
you shouldn ##t feel ashamed of your mom ##s action . it was not your fault .
sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time . there are good ones . if you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you .
i know it ' s hard . just don ' t give up .
i understand how you feel
i bet you will be able to men ##d the fences after this meeting
did you enjoy it ?
that is great to have fun .
that is so sad
that might be true
you must have thanked him for it ! what was the present ?
that is so helpful . i wish my brother would get me such presents .
what kind of emotions
i can understand
i miss those times too
i am confused by that as well
i would had the same reaction . why did they fire you ?
i understand . i hope you will find a better job .
i bet that was a nice feeling
i am happy for you
was it good >
sounds like a good weekend !
what could go wrong when you ' re taking an exam ?
i understand that but i think you will be fine ! we all get that fear when it comes to an important test , it means we ' re human and still feel things !
u ##gh dentist visits are the worst . at ##lea ##st you can look forward to taking a break from work .
oh yes , but sometimes my boss let me off when i have to go to the dentist !
that ' s quite an investment . it must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money .
that was really nice of you . i ' m sure that he appreciated it .
is it related to your passion ?
yeah , move on till you reach your dream job .
oh i am sorry to hear that . . . do you have plans on trying again ?
yes unfortunately it is . . . last time i went , it rained most of the day
that sounds like a great time .
it is nice that you still have those
are you happy about that ?
that sounds good ! i rather work earlier and leave earlier
so you have to do the whole process with the passport over again ? ?

400 plasma ?
oh really ?
lo ##l . that ' s no problem
that is tough . that is so nice of you to be there for them
sounds like you are a really great friend
what are you guys going to do
he sounds cool
it is always good to have things prepared in advance so you can get them done quick and easy .
i hate having to get everything ready at the last minute . it seems to he ##ctic and chaotic when you do things that way .
i am sorry , it happens though
i am sure she will forgive you
did she give you a reason why ?
i ' m sorry but maybe something came up for her that ' s a little personal ?
did he all get a ' s ?
i would be proud too . that takes a lot of effort to get straight a ' s .
how did it go
i am happy for you
oh was it a nice house ?
that ' s good for them then . i hope you get to buy a new home too .
oh no ! that ' s not good ! what ' s going on ?
that ' s not a good environment to be in . maybe you can find something else quickly .
congratulations ! i am sure you deserve it .
you will climb high in the company with that good attitude .
why are you nervous ? just try to be confident
change your way of thinking . maybe you are out of her league !
i am sorry you were mad
it will get better
did he come to pick you up ?
that is great to have someone that you can trust .
that ' s a good thing . a lot of people usually have to work on their weekends off instead of relaxing .
what did you do to relax during the weekend ?
oh my lord , how long to you think it had been there
that ##s not good , was he all smashed up ?
that sounds scary
i am glad you were okay
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha funny though . did he have something to do with it ?
oh ##hh ##h that ' s not fair
what happened ? did someone scare you ?
that is no good , but maybe he deserved it .
are you excited for it ?
wow you are really speeding things up there , aren ' t you ?
what ? did , you have any idea beforehand , or he just showed up with your idea .
oh no ! i didn ##t even think about that . that must have been terrible .
really ?
ok
oh no , how long did he live ? is he still alive ?
that ##s not very long , i am sorry for your loss .
why were you late getting to work ?
your boss should really understand things like that happen and not yell at you .
it ' s always great to rec ##onne ##ct . sounds like it was lots of fun .
you should make plans to do it again soon .
sounds like she did well
that sounds great
what kind of surgery
i am sure you will be okay
why you didn ' t go with her ?
that is bad . you should had planned your vacation together .
they say for the prepared there is no such things as a surprise test .
so how did you do on the test ?
that ' s good to have a brother like that . most don ' t seem to get along .
that ' s good . myself and my sister have gotten closer as we got older .
taxes are always tough
i am there now
that is nice . where are you going kay ##aking ?

that was nice of her ha
that does sound stress ##ful
i would have been too we get them bad here . are you in the south ?

that ' s such a coward ##ly thing to do . was there much damage ?
it could have been worse .

i understand ! its been about the same for me since my parents passed and it doesn ##t hurt any less . im sorry but i can tell you are strong !
i believe that , how did it happen ?
that is scary , it is not even your fault at all either
that is so gross . i hope you told the manager and got a ref ##und .
yeah , i would have said the same things . aren ' t they supposed to wear hair nets anyway ? that ##s ' s not acceptable .
wow that is a nice surprise ! you must have done very y ##well .

what show is it ?
ah , i have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show
i ' m so sorry ! is everything ok ?
are you sick or just not feeling well ?
no
really ? why did they give her a car ?
that ##s the worst when you do something for someone and they don ##t even appear to care !
same ! two wrong ##s never make a right . you are doing the right thing .
that ' s really cool , do you still keep in contact with them ?
yeah for sure , i hardly speak with any of my highs ##cho ##ol friends either .
oh sorry to hear that . . don ' t you like florida ?
that ##s true . . but why don ' t you give it a chance ? may be you will end up liking it
so sorry to hear that buddy . . where were you planning to go ?
yeah , i can sense how you feel . . it is ok buddy , you will make it there soon enough
oh no . . why would they do that
i understand that buddy . . cheer up , something better will come along soon enough

your family is most likely just as proud !
awesome ! extra money is always welcome right ! any special plans with it ?
so sweet of you and sounds like a lot of fun enjoy !
i completely understand your point , even i get emotional about my family
and we should . . family comes above all , right ?
that ' s true . . it is challenging . how old are you ?
it is natural to feel that way in early 20 ' s , trust me . you will adapt with time though : )
what happened to it ?
that is not good , did you complain ?
how old are you now ?
hmm . . don ' t worry about it . you ' ll get the hang of adult ##ing soon enough .
yeah , i hear you . . i can see how that can in ##vo ##ke envy . . you ' ll get there soon
you won ' t be , i assure you . do your part and hope for the best . : )
i have seen preview ##s for it . looks exciting .
you aren ' t going to be able to sleep thinking about it .
what did you eat ?
was it expensive ?
om ##g so amazing ! beautiful ! im happy for you both . : ) how far along is she ?
u ##gh ##hh its so hard to keep good secrets tho honestly !
i agree with you ! what are you into watching right now ?
i ' ve been looking forward to get some time to sit down and watch it , i can ' t wait !
you are so right . i don ##t get it
its weird that men ##s bathroom are sometimes cleaner .
what did he win ?
that ' s terrible .
where they too loud ?
usually people who work weekends . it ' s pretty rude they were so inc ##ons ##ider ##ate .
i ' ll keep my fingers crossed for you !
that sounds like a lot of fun ! did you have a good time ?
that ' s great to hear . the county fair is always a nice opportunity to spend time out with family .
they can be difficult . what is the issue ?
my kids eat all my snacks too . parent struggles are real .
yes it was ! i loved collecting the cards . they have pokemon go now
i liked it too it was fun to get out and get walking .
did you let her ?
i get that , swimming can be dangerous for kids
are they older or younger ?
i can understand why they mean so much to you !
what did you say to them ?
i get that i guess , but that is life sometimes
that ##s awesome ! ! ! you will save a lot of money for sure .
yu ##p that ##s how it is sure a car payment is expensive but it pretty much saves you money in the long haul and looks a lot nice ##r !
i know how that feels
once you get it over with you will feel better
i don ' t blame you . it removes your sense of security and change can always bring out fear .
one day you will be comfortable where your new home and not want to leave there either , it will only take some time .
well , water ' s water , so it should work out ok .
oh . dan ##g . well , i guess i was wrong then : p
i haven ' t been to a fair in so long .
that ' s cool . did you meet some cool people .
mine started last week .
i kinda miss them , and our schedule gets a lot bus ##ier when schools in .
do you own a harley ?
its not literally your day off because you are here working talking to me lo ##l
you may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore . sounds pretty rude to me .
maybe ask her to set the time when she can return it so you have a better idea when to expect it back .
what did you call for ?
im sorry about that
what ' s wrong with your brakes
you can always stop at a shop and have someone check it out
are you sure you didn ' t get an offer but they are running behind ?
i ' m sorry , i ' m sure you will find something soon .
ou ##ch , that could be bad . what was her reason ?
that ' s a tough thing to watch happen . just be there to support her when she needs it .
do you guys still work there ?
such an accomplishment
well that ' s sweet . i bet they love you
how many do you have ?
you should take a vacation ! that always helps me clear my mind .
oh man , that is rough . i ' m really sorry to hear that . hang in there !
they did . i ' ve struggled with trying to be more social , i think it makes life more fun .
it really is . wonder how we can go about changing things .
oh wow ! that ##s awesome . what type of car ?
oh sweet ! well cong ##rat ##s
that can be dangerous .
i hope no one gets hurt
i could agree with this
same here but mostly at x ##mas time
that is awesome . what do you do ?
that is great , i am so happy for you
for a party ?
i hate when that happens . i hope you complained and got a ref ##und
i love dr . pepper . it ' s just so hard for me to keep the weight down if i continue to drink it .
i try to keep it in mode ##ration now but even that is hard . it ' s so addict ##ing .
i remember playing that on the wii
will it be available on xbox ?
how is that feeling today ?
that is okay , everyone knows it is nasty anyway ##s
time heal ##s all pain
which is understand ##able
i get that , he was a very funny fellow , sad story
i did not really , so i see how you would be more attached
what did he make you ?
well , at least he tried . you have to be happy about that .
that is so true ! some woman aren ' t loyal
its great you trust an awesome woman
oh ! that ' s great to hear . what were you fighting about ?
it ' s normal to fight about things as a couple , but i would wait a little longer before you decide to get married : )
cruises are fun . what is the problem ?
two weeks is a long time .
i wouldn ##t risk it
how was it ?
that ' s pretty mean . . . je ##ez
i ' m gonna tell on you .
well , that ' s not nice at all .
you can confront them about it .
no ! ! ! i would die ! !
did you kill it ? ?
that ' s nice : ) i do that with pictures of my wife .
i hear you . the best motivation is family .
big plans ?
that ' s awesome !
i bet you were very nervous that day .
i am sorry to hear that
that is so true !
we ##ve been together for 10 years .
what kind of sofa is it ?
that is awesome ! congratulations
that is awesome ! i don ##t think anyone should feel ashamed of what they look like in a bathing suit . we all have imperfect ##ions !
i think we are all our own best critics and can be too hard on ourselves when it comes to appearances .
that ' s great to hear ! i love when people help each other
oh i know . i always try to help as much as i can . i donate clothes and food
that has happened to me too . what did you do ?
aw . a little mice won ' t hurt you . it ' s more afraid of you then you are of it .
did it run after you ?
did you scream loudly and run ?
oh no . that had to be painful
i know how you feel . at least its not on youtube
and epic ##ally failing lo ##l
did she not study enough ?
that ' s no good . what grade is she in ?
cool . have you found a place ?
well that ' s nice . is it going well ?
that really stink ##s ! did you complain to him ?
wow . . . what a bad neighbor ! maybe insurance will cover it ?
that sucks . do you always try specific diet ##s or do you sometimes just try to eat less ?
that ' s the worst part , the late night hunger ##s .
oh that ' s terrible . even worse that ' s in baby soap ?
well you dodged one bullet .
that ##s great for them !
yeah that can feel disappointing , and you can feel left out . im sorry that ##s how it is for you . maybe you will meet someone at their wedding ?
oh no ! that might be one of my worst fears ! could you sleep any more after ?
i ' ve heard of it , but i can ' t even imagine going through it . i ' m sorry it happened to you .
that sucks . i hate when friends move away . are you really good friends with them ?
at least she ' s moving for a good reason . i had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school .
that stink ##s : ( why did you have to work late ?
you should quit . there ' s nothing worse than a workplace with employees who can ' t carry their own weight .
i ' m sorry you ' re having trouble : ( is there anyone you can talk to about it ?
there ' s never too much : ) you can always find someone online or a therapist who you haven ' t talked to before .
i hear you . it ' s been super hot and humid here for weeks . the only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lo ##l
why not ? the pool is nice and cool : ) i just hate staying home for a long time
is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights ?
wow . what do they usually argue about ?
my family gets into politics a lot , but fortunately it rarely turns hostile .
congratulations ! that ##s awesome !
i bet ! i would be the same if i had a niece
that ' s good , stress is so common in life so it ' s easy to become overwhelmed .
that ' s an impressive philosophy , you seem to have grit so i think you will go far .
that ' s very nice of you . we need more compassion in the world for sure .
i understand . but my family turns a deaf ear . i ' m pleased that you did not .
oh no , were you happy about not having to work ?
i suppose your right , money matters
aw , that ' s nice . do you have a lot of good memories of high school ?
my experience wasn ' t that great , but i still had good times back then .
it happens to everyone , i stole too

that ' s wonderful , it must feel good to see your preparation pay off .
what sort of meat did they have ?
sounds really ta ##sty
oh man . was it body odor like he hasn ' t showered or something on him like smoke or animal stink ?
yeah i typically can ' t stand the smell of bo either . there really is no excuse . just take a shower man !
holy mo ##ly ! i hate spiders . . . you should spray your house more , just in case !
ha ##ha ##ha ! i would too , but keep some bug spray close too !
what is the square footage ?
that ##s a good size , good area as well ?
consider yourself lucky
better that than to be drowned in stud ##en t ##lo ##an
i would be upset too ! why would they do that ? did you try talking to teachers or principal ?
go ##sh that ' s frustrating ! i ' m sorry to hear that
any ##pl ##ace near you where you can get a cup ?
ok , that will do you i think at least for today ##l .
nice . i ' ve never had luck with being un ##pre ##par ##ed for things , i always choke .
probably . i ' m just bad at fa ##king it : p
that is awful ! did you break up with him ?
well i hope you can trust him again !

i love surprises like that ! what kind of cake did they get ?
how many hours a day are you training
good for you , i am really en ##vious of people that take the time to work on their body
e ##w ##w ##w ! that ' s gross . i actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side . i almost threw up
i bet your appetite was ruined !
how do you think the interview went ?
yes , that uncertainty is always tough to deal with . but i hope you get the job !
what were some of your favorites ?
i see , hopefully someone can fulfill his role
like what kind
don ##t we all
that ' s great ! have you been doing ok this year ?
that ' s really rough . im sorry . i hope everything goes well for you
aw man . who has been working there longer , you or the co - worker ?
did you receive any sort of feedback as to why you might have been passed over ?
boo ##oo ! yeah . might be worth chatting with hr to see if there are any pointer ##s you can get so maybe next time will go in your favor .
oh no ! that ' s unfortunate . . . did you guys reconcile ?
that ' s great to have that kind of support !
i think so . generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is un ##balance ##d .
i can understand that . hopefully everything works out in the end though .
im sorry ! are you going to be ok ?
i bet . it stink ##s that that is happening to you
yeah that ' s terrible . is you cat fixed ?
that might be why she does it . it ' s something to consider .
oh no , that ' s bad : ( what did you lie about ?
that ' s not good : ( so i bet your wife asked you if you give him something and you said no ? you should tell her
been there myself , the anticipation can really get to you . what kind of job is it ?
fin ##ac ##ial analyst , sounds impressive . good luck , i hope you do well and get it .
could you explain why ?
how much was in and why not return the cards and id ' s ?
do you miss your grandmother ?
did you get a picture of just her or does it also have you in the picture ?
any luck yet on that ?
well , i wish you luck . maybe you need a distraction .
could you prepare or ask for help on it ?
do your best and be confident about your work
oh no ! is it fix ##able or totally destroyed ?
understand ##able i would be too . did you explain to them the severity of what they did ?
oh nice , i ' m sure that is quite a relief . where are you going ?
i hear it ' s really nice there this time of year . i hope you have a good time !
that ' s awesome . have you been bowling for a long time ?
have you ever bowled a perfect game ?
cong ##rat ##s ! how long have you been with your company ?
good job , keep on moving up !
maybe is time for vacation ##s ?
may a change of jobs ?
i ' m a very ap ##oli ##tical person .
not really . i ' m a fe ##lon . i don ' t get to vote . so i have no representation . that makes me a subject of the u . s . , instead of a citizen .
that ' s em ##bara ##ssing . what was their reaction ?
pretend with her . maybe it ' s best to act like it didn ' t happen .
what did they do ?
did they know that the dress you were wanting ?
aw . i ' m sorry . i ' d say you have reason to be upset . i probably would be too .
what happened to you ?
did you ever move out ?
what happened ?
good , make sure you take your time and do your best
i haven ##t been a county fair in ages . did you make yourself sick eating junk food ?
of course . the rides are great . should have at least had a funnel cake .
how long has he been playing ?
so along time ?
i ' m really sorry to hear that . how long ago was that ?
oh wow . i didn ' t know about it . are you doing alright ?
that ' s good to hear . how long have you been married ?
that ' s great . do you have any children ?
oh no , did you ask the restaurant if they have video ?
that ##s unfortunate , the bright side is that it wasn ##t stolen and the car is still in good working condition
that was rude . did you confront them ?
i suggest you just ask them why they didn ' t invite you straight up . no need to sugar ##coat the main topic
wow , that ' s pretty early !
i bet he was . did you record it ?
aw ##w ##w , i used to play sega with my brother : ) it was awesome . streets of rage was my favorite game
oh man ! ! ! i remember contra ! ! it ' s a shooting game right ? go ##sh we used to play this game a lot ! !
same . there ' s a lot of things i wish i could go back to for a while .
that ' s the bad part about time : )
really ? maybe you should ask your boss for a raise .
oh , well that ' s no good . . . . you deserve to be paid more for your hard work .
ua ##u , that was a close call indeed .
i not going to even try that , thanks
that is interesting , why do you say that ?
i think a good amount of people feel the same
yeah , i know how that goes .
yeah , definitely . i ' m always looking for ways to make more money .
they do grow up quickly don ' t they ! but just think of all the wonderful new things he ' ll learn and friends he ' ll make . he ' ll be able to tell you all about it when he gets home !
that ' s a definite plus . you ' ll be able to have a little " me " time , which is also important .
that ' s great , on both counts . you must be so proud of them both .
ha ! i remember when my nephew was born . i visited my sister - in - law at the hospital . he ' s 21 now !
that sounds really annoying . have you said anything to them about it ?
oh that ' s not good at all . i can ' t believe they just let their dog do that .
that is very nice . did you feel better after that ?
that is very good and i am glad !
oh really , good for you !
i hope you do . good luck !
yeah , i hate getting stuck in traffic .
sometimes taking the long route will get you there faster .
what ? ? ? ? that ' s terrible ! ! what a horrible person !
i bet ! i mean you pay for gym membership , you can stay on any equipment as long as you want !
that ' s great ! congratulations . how much weight have you lost ?
that ##s fantastic . keep it up
i agree . if you can ' t trust family , then who can you trust ?
oh . . . well i guess you can ' t always trust family . but at least you can trust your wife and kids !
don ' t worry too much ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great .
yeah , everything will work out . that kind of thing is totally normal .
u ##gh that is so annoying . i try not to do that when i with my girlfriend .
have you talked to him about it ? how much it bother ##s you .
that is awesome . sounds like you studied hard !
awesome , great job !
i ' m sorry . that must make you sad .

i see , well kids will be kids
whoa ! i ' m sorry to hear that . did you want to kill the guy ?
yeah i suppose i would be too . well , if you ' re marriage survived , i hope things are better now .
i bet that was a nice surprise !
well i ' m happy for you . spend it on something nice for yourself .
nice ! that ' s an odd day to be paid , but good for you !
o ##oo ##oh i love bonuses . do you have any fun plans for it ?
did you feed it lately ?
maybe he is just missing you and wants to cu ##ddle or something .
losing a pet is a hard thing . was the cat old or sick ?
did you do anything special to honor it ?
that ' s no good ! did it stain your clothes ?
oh wow , it sounds like you were just really un ##lu ##cky that night .
that sucks , did you mess up on some job activities ?
oh , maybe you should tell your boss about how noon ##e likes him ?
did you eat something ?

i know : / . . . just make sure you do something fun when you have a chance !
did your car break down ? i always hate when unexpected things come up .

they always give a 4 hour window and either show up late or not at all
yeah that would make me angry

oh no . did you at least get a se ##verance ? were you able to get another job since ?
well i ' m sorry to hear that . hopefully something good is right around the corner !
maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date
yeah being with other adults can help
a new school year can be a pretty exciting thing . is it a new school year for you or your child ?
highs ##cho ##ol was a long time ago for me , but from what i remember i had great times .

it was . time helps .
wow , i bet that was a blast from the past .
sounds like it ! it makes me want to go find some of my old stuff .
why ?
oh that doesn ' t su ##pr ##ise me . i voted for hillary , i knew trump wasn ' t going to be worth anything . she probably wouldn ' t have been either though .
god for you . i am sure you are ready to ace that interview .
i am sure you will .
do you think that we are going to have another 2008 all over again ?

i quite fancy sea fishing - i like boats . did you catch many fish on your trip ?
that ' s pretty nasty . have you confronted her about it ?
that ' s really inc ##ons ##ider ##ate of her .
what ? ? that is so scary ! i ' m glad you are safe . that ' s why i always have my gun with me
it sucks that some places don ' t allow conceal carry ! like malls and some other places and that ' s exactly where those shooting ##s happen
that ' s great they were able to help you out . are you doing better now ?
i feel you . we were in a similar situation last year , but things have started looking up .
it is truly horrible . such incidents mostly happen due to drivers being careless like text ##ing while driving . i hope no deadly casualties had been involved in this event
my condo ##lence ##s to the family of that passed away man . it must be truly hard for them to grasp this whole sudden devastation
good for you ! ! ! i think its annoying when people act like that about anything .
yes i hope he wise ##s up some in the future !
did you end up getting one ?
nice , where did you go ?
are you stressed out ?
try and work out or find a new hobby to take your mind off of things
oh my , what is the matter ?
i am so sorry to hear that . what is wrong with him if i may ask ?
try and give them another call to see what the situation is
keep positive and try and get the answer you need .
oh ! what type ? a fun secret or one of those sad ##der ones ?
have then be able to ? may i ask what the secret is ?
re ##ase ##ar ##ching papers can be tires ##ome . did it turn out well ?
then it was worth it , even if it was ar ##du ##ous .
that is awful , hopefully you can plan another one soon
im sorry , that ##s the worst
oh no , i am so sorry . how long do you have to wait to take it again ?
i remember struggling with that too when i did my test . i was so nervous .
uh oh , that ' s bad . did you have insurance for it ?
oh no ! i hope you ' re able to get it fixed for cheap !
i love vacation time . where are you planning on going ?
sounds exciting . i ' ve never been there .
maybe just take it slow
maybe that was the case
what subject is it in ?
do you anti ##ci ##pate a problem ?
that is great for you !
it is lovely to have a friend like that .
that great news . i don ' t know how rare it is but in the 14 years i ' ve been married we ' ve seen a lot of other couples suffer with in ##fide ##lity .
i find faithful ##ness requires love and effort . both together are necessary .
agreed , it ' s a choice made every day .
i love to hear that , positive stuff ! im glad for you .
i love when good things happen especially since they usually don ##t happen often .
what do you mean ?
im sorry to hear that . i think everyone feels that way to a certain degree , even if it is more for some and less for others .
i understand , that can be hard to deal with ! have you tried anything new regarding what it is that you are self conscious about ?
yu ##ck , that would be bad .
no need to look closer at some things .
are you planning to keep it ?
that ' s fitting at least .
why is that ?
i understand , maybe things will improve for you !
oh no ! are you alright ?
i can ' t either . hopefully they don ' t actually cause someone else to wreck .
have you tried seeking expert help ?
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha ##h so you are more worried about your friend than actually fixing the boat ?
oh my goodness , that ' s crazy ! do you have home insurance to cover the cost to replace everything ?
yeah that ' s awful , i ' m sorry that happened to you . i ' m glad you ' re alright at least ! that ' s a scary thing to happen .
oh go ##sh ! are you alright ?
oh man ! i ' m so sorry to hear that .
don ##t be nervous , your instructors will not put you in danger
i can ##t argue with that lo ##l
i didn ' t know the exact timing like that , but it ' s bel ##ie ##vable and i know it ' s harder for the body to use the energy when you eat late .
exactly , and since they don ' t burn the body turns it into fat to burn later or something like that i think .
oh that sounds like a good deal ! it wouldn ' t get her in trouble or anything right ?
oh okay . that ##s up to you ! i just wouldn ' t want my friend to get in trouble !
oh yeah ? when is your friend arriving ?
why are they so sad ?
hmm , yeah that is a pretty sad thing . hopefully you can cheer them up a little .
did you study ?
that is great . i ' m glad for you !
well cool ! were you nervous at all going into it ?
so are you going to be going on a roller coaster at a fair for a second time ?
why is it so annoying ? is your friend messaging you all the time or something ?
oh , well that ' s not good . do you actually owe them ?
nice ! where will you be going ?
well i really hope you two have a great time !
don ' t beat yourself up about it . i did the same with my mother all the time when i was in my early teens . we ' ve all been there .
oh i agree , i still feel awful about it myself ! but i think our parents understand and don ' t take it to heart , because they usually did the same thing too : )
it is a gorgeous day where i live too ! i ' m sorry you don ' t have anyone to share it with ! do you have plans later ?
i ' ll be relaxing in my pool later ! you shouldn ' t let a day go wasted just because you don ' t have anyone to hang with !
what happened ?
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that . was he suspended ?
that is incredible i bet you are really proud
i remember when my daughter did her first steps i was so proud of her
probably not . but now i ' m interested to know . what happened ?
i can believe it . it does tend to happen .
oh god ! did everything turn out well ?
i would have been so scared ! i ' m glad it all turned out fine though !
what made you feel strange ?
i am sorry , we all have our moments of wanting to go back in time , i know i do .
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that , what is going on ?
that would make anyone upset ! i am sorry !
that ' s good you ' re getting a break ! life is much more rough as an adult than i thought it would be as a kid .
no kidding ! i ' m glad things are good for you now - rest , relax , and enjoy !
money is always amazing ! good for you .
go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it !
are you sad and all alone now ?
maybe you can find a new friend !
oh , what a worry that must have been . did you have to evacuate ?
that must have been awful ! friends in florida had to evacuate . when they got home their house had feet of mud in it . did you have much damage to your property ?
oh how fun ! ! ! i bet you had a great time ! ! ! i love county fairs !
that sounds amazing ! ! i love the old fashioned theme . what was your favorite thing at the fair ?
did they have a live band or was it more of a dj type thing ?
sounds super gross ! i bet you were a mess .
that ##s how it usually is then boom fly guts all over your helmet and clothes .
where do you like to get your purse ##s ?
you sound like a smart and informed shop ##per .
you can use the left over money on so many other things !
cool ! that sounds like a lot of fun ! i bet it will be a blast for you .
it ' s always great when you can afford to get what you like . good for you ! i ' m sure you deserve it !
how far away is she ?
well , that was nice .
that is a good feeling . what has changed ?
that is so awesome ! cong ##rat ##s !
how old was your dogg ##y ?
did she have a disease ?
oh yeah what kind of boat ?
sounds super cool im happy for you
oh no ! i am so sorry ! ! i hate when something lie ##k that happens . no one was injured ?
well , i am glad no one was injured ! ! ! its a shame to lose great kitchen ##ware though ! ! i hope you will be able to find a suitable replacement !
oh my go ##sh . you must have been horrified . i can ' t even imagine .
thank goodness you are ok though . that could have been really , really bad .
that ' s good news . did they have a good track record for sales in past jobs ?
hope it all works out for you . selling cars can also be a st ##res ##ful ##l job .
what ! ! that ' s awful oh my my goodness that ' s really pathetic
exactly how can you go there not being able to trust your cow ##or ##kers
no ##oo ##o ! i ' ve been there , and i feel your pain ! what kind were you trying to get ?
that sounds delicious and i ' m going to have to try that ! my personal favorite is ben & jerry ' s phi ##sh food . now i want some .
oh , really ? what happened to you ?
wow , that ' s pretty scary ! glad there was a good sam ##ari ##tan around to warn you !
oh my that ' s a big problem . what did you do ?
that ' s good ! but also was wondering what is a liv ##id ?
oh , : d
well good for you . what did you do to prepare yourself ?
well good . did you get the job ? !
that ##s awesome news cong ##rat ##s !
even better honestly then you didn ##t have to deal with the stress of trying and it just came natural !
is it the first day of school for them ?
summer breaks seem to be getting shorter each year . hope they had a good day as well .
okay , but probably not a good idea in the long run .
hopefully , you ' ve got a new friend .
sounds like a fun time ! what did you guys do ?
glad you guys got to spend some fun fa ##m time together
i would be so excited !
hopefully everything goes really well for you and happy birthday !
wait , what ? ! that ' s unbelievable ! why ?
ri ##iii ##ght . . . that ' s a stupid lie if i ' ve ever heard one . fight this if you can ! after 10 years , they should be promoting you if anything .
that was smart to get a used one . i hope you got a good deal on it .
i think most of the time when people sell children ' s items you ' re pretty safe . and you can google to make sure of it too .
that ' s freak ##in awesome ! i never win anything , go you ! what band is it ?
i love them ! ! ! so jealous , hope you have a blast !
aw ##w , i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends .
i definitely understand . it really sucks that you ' re so limited .
im so sorry to hear that . what is wrong with him ?
that sounds oddly crazy and wild . reminds me of ra ##bies ? i hope you make his last days his best and glad he won ##t be suffering anymore .
that is wonderful ! they must be so happy and relieved also to not have to pay !
oh good . i was going to ask how you felt about it . are you in college ?
that ##s awesome , good for you
well that is great , very hard thing to accomplish
strange place for something to surprise you . what happened ?
ee ##k , i ' m with indiana jones on this one . i hate snakes . hope you weren ' t bit !
oh wow , i hate when people record those type of videos . it ' s really not funny to me and very inc ##ons ##ider ##ate of that person ! how em ##bra ##ssing !
ha ##ha ##ha pay back is the sweet ##est revenge sometimes
that is crazy ! that must seem to fly by .
yeah that must be very strange . i do not have any children , but i can imagine how crazy that is to watch them grow up !
wow , i didn ' t know that ! did you have a good time ?
that ' s wonderful ! i am so glad that you had a good time . maybe i will visit there one day .
about what ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , i hope your luck changes up soon !
wow , that sounds really fun ! i ' ve never been on a cruise ! how long will it be for ?
neither have i , and that ' s on my bucket list ! so jealous ! i hope you have an awesome time !
well that ' s exciting ! a fresh start is always fun . what inspired you to make such a big change ?
awesome , you ' ll be able to make friends at work . i wish you the best in your new city , cong ##rat ##s !
aw man , kids can be so lazy and don ' t like to do what they ' re supposed to . have you tried a rewards system to get them to do what they have to , or are they too old for that ?
yes . i say make them do it . maybe take away phones , etc . if they don ' t get it together . no excuses for that !
oh no how terrible . was anyone hurt ?
i bet , i would be too . did you stop and talk to the police ?
aw ##w , that must be kinda hard on you .
i ' ve definitely been there , my husband is in the military so he ' s away often . i find it ' s helpful to stay busy , trying new ho ##bbies help !
oh no . i ' m sorry to hear you are going through a rough patch .
that really does help . i hope you make it through !
i am so sorry to hear that ! have you already filed for unemployment ?
if you do a google search for your state + unemployment you should be able to find resources and might be able to file online . i ' m sorry again , that ' s tough .
that ##s a big accomplishment
ye ##a that ##s fair
oh no , is your cat okay ?
i can understand that , anytime i smell or see vomit i want to vomit too .
ee ##w ! my neighbor ' s cat used to pu ##ke on my bed - coughing up a fur ##ball .
not surprised - i ' ve felt like that too . did you manage to get it cleaned up ok ?
what is that ?
that sounds so awesome ! and fun !
did you ask her to kindly stop ?
she may not be the best choice of a friend if she likes annoying you so much . maybe try di ##stan ##cing yourself from her for a while .
oh cool ! what would that be ?
aw i ' m sorry . i ' m sure you ' ll get something you want eventually though !
that ' s good . as long as at gets you where you need to go . that ' s what matters .
same here .
lo ##l that is impressive
lo ##l i bet
did you re ##tal ##iate ?
i ' m sorry to hear that
ha ##ha ! that ' s hilarious from my perspective , but must have been embarrassing for you ! what did you do ?
i happens to all of us at least once in our lives !
oh wow ! i remember the commercials too ! he looked like the cool ##est toy out there ! did your daughter like it ?
i guess its true , everything comes back around in style and toys and things . that would make a fun christmas gift ! ( then you could play with it too ! ha ha )
bet you ' re tired . what ' s the speech for / about ?
ah okay , doesn ' t sound fun . hope you did well and everything went smoothly !
that sounds like a lot of fun ! have you been practicing for a long time ? i ' m too much of a k ##lu ##tz to be able to do that so i respect you for it .
that ' s really cool . hope you have a lot of fun !
that ' s a real bum ##mer . i bet you were pretty ticked off .
yeah , i ' ve had that happen to me before . some bags are cheap and fall apart .
scary ! ! ! what was it ? were you terrified or just curious ?
i would be too ! did you try to see if you could see someone from another window or just run back to bed ? i ' m glad you ' re ok !
there are a lot of people allergic to shell ##fish . that ' s a bum ##mer though , lobster is good .
oh no that is terrible . how did you find out it had lobster in it ?
that ' s awesome , animals are the best ! what kind , and is it a boy or girl ?
aw , that ' s a great friend right there . cong ##rat ##s on your new puppy !
that ##s a bum ##mer ! do you not have a case on it ?
that ##s good , make sure to get a case too !
how do you mean ? i guess it depends on the lady , does it not ?
oh , i am so sorry - that is an awful thing to happen . but please don ' t think all women are like that ; many are loving and loyal .
i am very sorry ! that is very frustrating ! can you speak with a supervisor about the situation ?
i don ' t blame you , i would talk to him . even if he is un ##in ##vo ##lved , it is not fair for you to bear the full weight of the tasks at hand . i sure hope he has a solution and the work load ease ##s !
oh , i bet that did ir ##rita ##te you ! it ' s bad enough moving , but you don ' t need your furniture falling apart on you .
yes , and possible it just had too much stuff on it . but , you ' re right , sometimes it ' s cheap wood they use .
were you scared ?
i would be scared too . it is cool that you were brave enough to try though .
oh no , that ' s always really stress ##ful . just do your best to prepare , and try not to worry about it . whatever happens , happens , and if you ' re less stressed you ' ll probably do better .
no problem , and i ' ll send good vibe ##s your way that you pass ! good luck , you ' ve got this .
oh ##h , go ##sh . what happened ?
oh ##h that ' s bad . you seem struggling to provide food for your kids . i will pray for you , and wish you a good luck in future . but , don ' t shop ##lift again , otherwise you will get into trouble
that was so nice . what kind ?
carrot cake is wonderful !
that ##s awesome , i hope you win ! what are you playing ?
i bet you will do great ! ! it sounds like you have been practicing very hard and you have the desire . that is a winning combination ! !
that sounds like a nice memory , but we all grow old . do you still spend time with them sometimes ?
yeah i agree . i have a little one myself , and i kind of with they stay that young forever .
that sounds very exciting . i am sure you will have a great time .
those sound like fun activities . i hope you take lots of pictures so you can remember the trip .
that sounds fun . was it a scary movie ?
oh okay . did you watch it all alone ?
what made you suspect that it might rain ?
it ' s good that you thought ahead .
i hate to hear that ! i hope everything goes well and you get better news than you are expecting .
i always try to do things to avoid thinking about things like that , maybe you could do the same !
that sounds fun ! but what is corn ##hole ? i ' ve never heard of it before !
okay interesting . i ' d like to try is some time !
oh , man ! that is my nightmare ! you must have been so worried ! are you ok ?
i would imagine ! that is great news ! i am sure you had a nice sigh of relief !
u ##gh that is so annoying ! have you confronted him about it yet ?
wow what a jerk . . . sorry you have to deal with that . i hope you can resolve that situation somehow .
you should take the doc ##s advise and get your health under control though , its important !
good i hope you do well and stick to it !
i would be so embarrassed . i would have probably done the same thing , but i would feel so guilty .
yeah , that ' s what i would probably do also . it probably won ' t even be that big a deal in the end .
that is great ! what a nice parent ! you must be pumped ! you should do something nice for her to show your appreciation !
that is a great idea ! cruises are amazing . you all will have a great time !
i ' m so sorry . what kind of t
oh wow . i bet that was really hard . hopefully next time you will win
that ##s awesome ! what was the charity ?
that is kind , when i have the means i try to donate
oh ##h , that ' s great ! now he ' s ready to learn life lessons . ha ha !
ha ha ! don ' t be annoyed , that ' s what children do ! believe me !
that is a wonderful attitude to have ! being content and happy with your life is so important !
most people always complain about what they don ' t have and never stop to appreciate what they do have .
that sounds like a lot of fun . i have always wanted to go to one of those shows .
i like how colorful the whole production is . it really does look amazing .
oh ##h that ' s bad . what happened ?
i feel you . that happens with me every time .
oh my , what happened to cause this ?
she ##esh , i ' m sorry about that sha ##rting is the worst
om ##g cong ##rat ##s : d
yeah at first it might feel a little lonely , but it ' ll be nice to have some relaxation time , right ?
that would be nice . we need some rain too .
thanks ! enjoy your rain !
that terrifying , i am scared to death of hurricanes
that is understand ##able ! were you effect ##ed by harvey ?
that ' s a real bum ##mer . i am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didn ' t win in the playoffs .
it must be satisfying to see the improvements of your pitchers . you are really helping their careers .
cats eat everything , they are not humans
the buy yourself the food
oh well , you can ##t go back and change it now
im just saying , don ##t feel bad i highly doubt your one vote would have been a tie breaker any ##how .
that is good , what do you find good about the economy ?
do you think the unemployment rate is going down ?
im sorry about that ! did your son start school already ?
that ##s great . that ##s good to hear
that is nice to hear . i hope they really like each other .
yeah well you will find someone one day . just be patient !
oh ##h ! that ' s so awkward ! what happened then ?
yes ! maybe you should set a reminder next time ! ha ha !
i ' m sure it ' s hard waiting for the new releases when it ' s a game your h ##ype ##d up for ! i enjoy playing games too !
i enjoy rpg games the best . so , i really liked fable , halo , sims , assassin ' s creed , etc .
that is so true . i agree with you
yeah , people tend to have some harsh reviews on things and that could be tr ##ou ##bling
whoa yeah that ##s awful , i wouldn ##t either
i agree 100 % , you make a commitment , should stick too it
i stop playing video ##games years ago
i prefer to read books on my free time because i am grown up
well , he is probably lying .
elvis only had a da ##ug ##ther , so the chances of him telling the true are slim
the economy is cyclic ##al so it is bound to happen eventually .
well the last time the economy was bad we had a different president . it is hard to say why recession ##s happen .
that is very true ! they are very good
i am ! they are my favorite team !
i am sorry to hear that ! i hope your dog gets better

that is very impressive ! my brother in law is starting his senior year as well
certainly , does she have a college in mind ?
ha , you ' ll have to en ##light ##en me as i don ' t know much about the chargers . are they usually not a good team or what ?
that ' s unfortunate . how do things look for this upcoming season ?
that ##s wonderful ! cong ##rat ##s
well that is wonderful ! i would be proud as well
that ' s awesome . was this the first year this particular team was together ?

that is awesome . i bet you really helped him develop his talent .
you have made a big difference . glad you are making a difference .
that ##s a horrible feeling , especially something sentimental
i hope like crazy you find it ! !
lo ##l that ##s tough to deal with , have you asked if she has any friends ?
ah dan ##g dude that ##s kind of cold hearted
i understand that . i bet you miss them a lot .
yeah it is rough at that age to be apart . at least you can sky ##pe and keep in touch .
that is rude of them , they should at least wave a thank you or something
yeah i always to make sure to thank the people that do nc ##ie things for me
i ' m sorry i don ' t know who that is . was he famous ?
oh . sounds like a big loss for black ##hawks fans , that sucks .
that is a huge moment in a kid ' s life ! i would be too , congratulations
i do not at the moment , but i plan to at least when i turn 35 years old
oh man that ##s terrible , that ##s a horrible feeling !
at least everyone was still at work and you weren ##t left there alone !
that is awesome , i bet it took a lot of hard work to accomplish
yeah i remember a long time friend went there and it was such a pain to be able to get accepted

im sure ! its tough being at home all day without al ##ot of interaction
yes they are . it ' s a shame how dry it is .
yes that is what it ' s like in my area too .
i have heard about that game . is it a role playing game ?
oh cool . i should check it out . i like those kinds of game .
oh my goodness , i would freak if my dog ran out , he is like another child of ours
that is great , its nice to have someone that is so helpful around
that is crazy , does your boss not care ?
you could just start going in late everyday as well , to make a point to her .
i wish i could stay up late and just watch tv alone some times . i don ' t have any alone time .
yu ##p .
i love winter and wearing sweater ##s and jeans . this summer heat is too much !
i live in the south but i ' m from the north and that ' s one think i miss is the cooler weather . i definitely dread the summer as well .
you are more trusting then i am . i don ' t even trust my wife in my car .
that ' s very nice of you . maybe i can learn from you and be more trusting .
that is not good , did you manage to get it done somewhere el ##es ?
that is not good i really hope you can get it done on friday
oh the new one comes out on friday ? i used to play it back in college a bit with my roommate ##s .
wow you are a dedicated player . i ' d imagine you will do awesome online then .
great health and being well off is a blessing , i too am grateful for tha
i agree ! its refreshing to hear someone with a good outlook on life
i live in a small town too . i grew up in a big city so the change is very welcome
small town country life is much more my speed
i can relate to that , the late night anxiety of the unknown . hate that .
it always seems to wait til your head hits the pillow , then bam !
oh no . is she alright ?
so she probably had scar tissue . i hope this one goes better for her .
i imagine so , especially when you have no idea what to expect
lo ##l what country are you in ?
oh man , did you put your socks on after you put your boots on ? that must of been awkward getting your socks dirty .
for sure , that is a motto to live by ! i wouldn ' t dream of doing anything different .
i can relate . i wish i still enjoyed them as much as i did way back then . now i ' m either out of place of it ' s a ghost town .
i live in a very large city on the east coast . we have one mall here called the king of prussia mall . it ' s the 2nd largest in the usa . any time you go it ' s packed but if you drive 15 minutes to any of the other malls around it they are sad . half the stores closed and no people .
heck yeah ! i myself have never been into madden , more of a nba ##2 ##k guy .
i ' ve been playing it since i was a kid , but i always wait like 3 years in between buying them .
that is a great feeling , what are you pu ##su ##ing ?
man that ##s awesome , i have a friend who is in that field and its very interesting
i understand that for sure , finishing a task is a great feeling
cong ##rat ##s ! was it for college ?
yes i love them they deserve to win
but don ' t forget that the yankees are super good
oh no ! we went through the same thing last december
i know that ##s right , i don ##t know how they survived without electric
congratulations , looks like you guys will be saving a lot of money from no more dia ##pers .
ha ##ha , you can ' t always be 100 % accurate when you first pursue a goal !
i know the feeling , it makes you wish time would slow down
that ##s right , going through the same feeling with my son
i don ' t have any kids , but i can only imagine . it even seems like i ' m growing old fast .
how old is he ?
did it scare you or did you make a new friend ? it happened to me a few years ago and it turns out the dog just needed a friend .
go over when your neighbor is home and make friends with the dog . take him a ball or a treat . if it happen again you know your safe .
that ' s great ! what a good husband
i don ##t mind laundry as long as i don ##t have to cook !
that ' s great . it stink ##sw ##hen you have to worry about customer service giving you a hard time
exactly . some companies really try to go above and beyond
it must feel lonely , for sure , but maybe they cope with it in different ways .
yeah , it is quite sad knowing there are some people who have literally no one .
why is that buddy
i ' m glad she changed . at least now you guys can save money on food because it ' s cheaper to cook
how long has it been ?
oh ok . well that ' s awesome . what did you guys do ?
what country are you living in ?
how interesting . do you move for your job ?
oh that ' s a great habit to have . did you go to the gym ?
wow that ' s a great accomplishment ! i need to get back to the gym too .
i don ' t think i have ever remembered a single friends birthday until facebook was created .
that is true , were they upset ?
probably , you just have to remember next year !
you are very trusting . i ' d just assume give my kidney to someone as 10 ##k .
your better then i am . i hope you don ' t learn a lesson the expensive way .
who is carrying them out ?
sounds horrible , do you think they ' ll get caught ?
that ' s cool . i bet it brought back memories of your mom in the kitchen using it !
i ' m guessing she was either busy , or didn ' t like to cook ? i can relate !
oh
sorry , i accidentally sent that first message early . that is great that she is going back to school . i bet you are so proud of her
yeah that is pretty tough . especially when you really like to work together .
then you have to meet their replacement and try to get to know them better . it usually isn ' t the same .
you must be a good cookie chef ! don ' t feel too bad , they should have been quicker !
oh , you ' re sly ! call the cookie addiction hot ##line quick !
always great to see people you ##ve been away from , happy early birthday !
lo ##l no doubt ! i got to see a bunch of friends recently at a wedding it was nice
for vacation ? and yeah , the rates are pretty high , hopefully you won ' t be in those areas .
that ' s awesome , i bet it ' ll be in a nice secluded resort !
i grew up in miami so i know how you feel
i know what you mean . i lived thru hurricane andrew and it was trauma ##ti ##zing
i ' m sorry to hear that . is it drugs or alcohol ?
oh my ! i thought the wrong thing . i ' m so sorry to hear that , i hope he is okay !
what did you drink specifically ?
did you eat anything ?
i agree . i wish all the countries would get along . no need to be mean to each other .
also i think all the countries should allow foreigners to visit . i don ' t understand why they are so territorial .
that is intense ! what was it ?
ah ##h dan ##g , that ##s terrible ! that is pretty bad luck
did she take care of a bunch of dying kids ?
that is good , it is nice to have a woman like that
what school did you go to ?
wow ! i ' m from that area and love the buck ##eye ##s too !
why not ? how can you not be happy with a 6 - pack ?
that ' s insane , i hope you plan on returning that asa ##p !
that ##s insane ! ! were you able to get in ? and what concert ?
shoot that ##s a bum ##mer ! hopefully they will make it up to you
seriously . i was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse . then to read about everything that makes the crime rate is overwhelmingly scary .
i know , it really makes you lee ##ry of everyone around you . there are still some good people in the world though . i ' m one of them ! : )
wow that is very far away . do you get to visit often ?
yeah that is a bum ##mer . maybe one day you will live closer together .
that happened to me once i almost died . my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat .
but what if it ' s just some air or something
what was the subject ?
i ' d imagine it ' s tough
that is good that you have something to protect yourself with
i com ##ple ##tly agree , specially with the crazy people there is these days
did they choose to switch themselves or was it out of their control ?
well maybe you guys can hang out outside of work ?
that ' s great ! sounds like he ' s a smart kid !
that ' s awesome , just keep him on the right path and he ' ll be the next el ##on mu ##sk !
that would be good . there is so much vi ##tri ##ol happening in society these days .
i wish people would just get along . stop fighting each other .
it is really eating me up inside . i will make sure to pay it back with my next pay ##che ##ck .
who got in ?
you mean the men of the underworld ?
ok , who is competing you ?
nice , will check it up , i love indoor athletics as well
aw , i ' m sorry , why can ' t you ?
i ' m with you on that one , especially if it requires flying . no way can i afford that .
i grew up with hurricanes and those are terrifying i can imagine tornado ##s
exactly . are you in the usa ?
wow the tri ##fect ##a ! congratulations on that !
right , i think you are in for a row ##dy time for sure !
i never liked those either . do you have any health problems that would make you dread it ?
don ' t sweat it . you ' ll do great . its never a fun process but that ' s so good you ' re keeping up with your health !
do you at least get to ride in it with him ?
yeah , it ' s always better to get motivated rather than jealous ! use it as motivation to save more money .
that is awesome . it ' s nice how social media can rec ##onne ##ct people .
i think it has its purpose . it makes it easier to find people you lost touch with .
oh trust me , there ' s nothing to be jealous about ! the heat is killer where i live .
i live in central louisiana in the us . our winters never really get that cold . i ' d say cold ##est is 25 degrees fa ##hre ##nh ##eit .
that ' s always scary , the plane starts shaking and you immediately think " we ' re going down ! "
i bet your anxiety was through the roof , i ' ve flown a lot and still that freaks me out .
do you not see them much ?
i can relate . i last seen my mom around 8 years ago and my dad around 10 years ago . maybe you should move closer to them .
oh no . that is horrible
oh goodness i know right
that ' s awesome , what did you do to take advantage of it ?
that ' s great , nothing beats the farmer ' s market .
wow that is interesting . did you win the case ?
great job ! i would have laughed as well . great technique to prove your point , it is always good when you can get emotion from the judge
oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear about this , may his soul rest in peace
may his soul rest in peace and his memories live on
well it was there for you . if someone else wanted it they would have been there first !
you are very thoughtful . i am sure he understands a chocolate craving is never to be denied !
that is wonderful ! that is a difficult instrument to master . was he nervous beforehand ?
what a wonderful moment ! does he want to try to take it professional and be in an orchestra or does he not know yet ?
oh no . is everything ok ?
did you ?
i would get someone to look at it if possible to avoid any disasters
sounds like a productive evening ! what did you cook ?
sounds more healthy than the chi ##c - fi ##l - a that i had !
i do too , flying is kinda nerve ##wr ##ack ##ing
oh yes definitely
why do you say that ?
that is amazing ! i bet you ' re excited
that stink ##s but i guess the law is the law . are you going to fight it ?
i know how that feels but i guess they have to pick someone and it was just your bad luck day . it can always be worse .
what kind of practice is it ? that takes a lot of guts !
not literally of course , lo ##l . good for her , i am sure she will do fine !
does it make you feel good to at least think about those times though ?
yeah life comes at you fast .
oh my god i ' m so sorry . i ' ve only got one grandpa ##rent left and it ' s tough to even imagine not having her
i do . i ' m so sorry you are having such a hard time . may you find peace in her memories .
that is always a wonderful feeling to be prepared and ready to go . are you a morning person ?
i can understand that . such a great idea before the chaos of it all . its important to do things like that your ourselves !
you shouldn ' t be jealous . there is no need for that
well that is ridiculous . im sorry
did you have to take a test ?
that ' s good . if it ' s like mine - you had to wait forever !
why did that happen
that does suck
what happened
i bet that will be fun
that ' s nice . is he enjoying retirement
that ' s great . i hope to retire some day .
do you feel like that helps or hind ##ers your personal life ?
i can relate i like to keep work at work but as an adult you spend so much time at work it ' s hard to meet people other places .
how beautiful ! they are so much bigger when i see them than i think they are going to be . my parents house has some land and when i bring my kids over there , we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard .
yes ! they ' re legs are so much longer than i thought and they hope over they ' re 8 foot tall privacy fence like its nothing !
that is amazing . children can amazing you if you give them the opportunity
it ' s crazy the things they are learning now . it makes you feel like a dummy
why ' s that ?
are there any other types of seafood you like ?
that is very sad
i am sure he did
get ready to wait for a long time . d ##m ##vs are terrible .
some allow you to make an appointment . you should try that .
well , that ' s fun ! i bet you are really excited about it .
oh , front row tickets make it even better ! have a great time .
oh no , i think i know where this is going . how did she manage as a waitress ?
ha ##ha oh boy ! well , on the bright side i ' m sure that ' s a mistake she ' ll only make once . we all have to learn .
one of the many reasons i ' m glad to have hardwood !
how have they changed the most ?
what do they do now ?
did you end up washing dishes .
was he upset about it ?
a what ?
oh i thought he wanted a baby . . dump him first
actually my aunt is afraid of them also . she said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her . why are you scared of them ?
strange . next time you have them try them cooked in goose liver fat and scotch . amazing !
im sorry about that . don ##t be nervous though . he is a loyal person i bet
what is the name of the company ?
were you worried at all about the cost of raising them ?
yeah , i ' d imagine
nice , what team is that you are root ##ing for ?
no , i really don ##t follow sports much .
college ?
oh wow that ##s great .
big plans ?
i have never been camping .
that ' s really nice , we don ' t get a lot of that these days . makes me kind of miss the old days when people had a real sense of community .
i totally know what you mean . i live in a smaller city now and it feels a lot co ##zier than larger cities i ' ve lived in before .
why is it torture ?
yeah , maybe next time
that must be pretty lonely . do you talk often ?
well that should help
well ee ##p it up and visit when you can
how come ?
ha ##ha oh no .
i bet he appreciated that at least
at least it didn ' t turn into one of those che ##es ##y 80 ' s movies
sweet !
what k ##kind did you get ?
i have always had hp . i do have an ipad though
wow that ' s great ! how old is he ?
that ' s wonderful to see that kind of progress . you must be very proud .
that ' s nice of you . is it a small dog or large ?
did it make you want one of your own ?
why , what is happening on monday ?
those are always stress ##ful , better study hard !
that is good , are you married ?
do you want to have kids in the future ?
that ' s a bum ##mer , at least it didn ' t go out in the beginning of summer , i guess .
dad ' s are always life save ##rs . i love my dad as well , he has saved me in a couple of occasions .
yeah it sucks when people just seem to have it all .
are you the type that ' s prone to getting sick ?
well that ' s too bad . yeah when you have bad genetics there aren ' t enough apples to keep the doctor away .
was there a reason why ?
maybe it was closed event . you speak to her about it ?
oh no ! were they okay ?
i bet you were relieved .
oh no that ' s horrible . any idea why ?
that ' s so strange . i ' d give the power company a call and see if there wasn ' t a mistake .
you should find the local cafe or something
you can always google the local hot spots . you ' ve got to get out there . it might not be easy
i used to get screw ##balls with my sister . those were our favorites as kids
how awesome . it ' s fun to remember the good old days
i love sharing memories with my sister
i hate when that happens
i haven ' t had pizza h ##t in forever . they don ' t deliver in my area
did you complain ?
well that sucks
what is with the book you are writing ? people don ##t chat like that . ye ##a christmas list
its all good . you are able to write very well . im jealous
ah , bum ##mer
probably , yeah . good luck
i am sure you will do just fine !
absolutely , and if you can start with a game for them too that would help .
sorry to hear about that . is it still working alright , or under warrant ##y ?
that stink ##s . phones are so important these days . people always give others crap about staring at them all day , but it ' s because they afford us the ability to do so many things . i hope you ' re able to get another one soon .
do you feel better now ?
that ' s good it ' s sucks when you have to take care of yourself when you don ' t feel well .
i am too
i understand that as well
i can understand that . everything is right at your doorstep ##s .
that can be very rough . maybe you can move there soon !
that sounds terrible
they are so rude
did you take him to the vet ?
oh that ##s good then .
little kids are pretty amazing how they can pick things like that up in the right environment . so nice you are teaching him good manners , those are in short supply in adults these days !
poor little guy . sounds like he ' s lucky to have you , especially at such a critical time in his life .
what is it for ?
that ' s pretty cool . i am a pharmacy tech
that is so true . that certification was really easy . i was nervous for no reason
you will do great !
that must have been a nightmare . how many do you have ?
that can be rough . i know i ' ve dealt with that with my kids by giving them each 10 minutes of solo time before they go to bed . allows them to get their energy out .
it should work ! let them pick what you do for the 10 minutes , then move to the other one . i ' ve done puzzles , read books , and solve rub ##ix cube ##s with mine . good luck !
where is he going and for how long ?
oh i hope he is safe . i hear there is a lot popping off there right now !
wow , that ' s huge ! i wonder if he got sick afterward ?
i bet he did lo ##l ! i would have too if i ate that much !
i am sure you are , it is nice
that is a great feeling
that is great . when did you take the test ?
was it hard or an easy test ?
congratulations ! what are you studying ?
wow , that subject was always tough for me in school . good for you !
i hate when that happens
was this at home or at work ?
really ? congratulations ! i hope you guys are really happy !
that ' s always awesome when the kids approve of him ! i ' m really happy for you guys and wish you the best !
what is happening this weekend ?
sounds fun , where at ?
that ##s good
those sound like good people to have around
oh that is a pick ##le . cong ##rat ##s on the new love . why might your parent not approve ?
ah they had certain expectations , i see . well , you can ' t help who you fall in love with . hopefully they will support you in the future .
that ' s great , i hope he enjoy his / her stay
how long is he staying ?
did you teach him ?
sounds like he ' s a natural
something yu ##mmy i ' m sure . are you nervous ?
perhaps some vin ##o with it ?
yi ##kes , i ' m not sure that will match well with chicken par ##m .
yeah i know how that feels . i think it is part of growing up .
kids have ave ##rs ##ions to clean rooms . she is not the only one who does that .
i believe in that too .
well it think there is a time frame on the bad luck though
christmas ?
oh wow ! congratulations . first one ?
oh no , what for ?
i ' m sorry , i hope everything goes okay !
i can imagine ! what did you have on the pizza ?
car ##bs are great when you haven ' t had them in a while . you deserved to sp ##lu ##rge !
i hear you ! have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them ? helps me a lot !
yes , it is usually if you h ave acidic blood i think - too much sugar ? try onions , garlic and lemon ##s , generally stops them from biting me . i hate mis ##qui ##tos .
i hope it turns out well for you
that doesn ##t sound good .
good , were you always late ?
you meant on time for home . that is good .
i can understand the feeling . what job did he get ?
oh wow , does he make a lot of money ?
i think the right amount of span ##king is ok . i was span ##ked as a child and know i deserved it . hopefully you didn ' t take it to far though !
don ' t beat yourself up too much . spare the rod , spoil the child . your guilt seems to be from what other people might think . you know if it was necessary or not .
i still have yet to see it . i hate how h ##ype affects things . i wish you could always get to things before they become really pumped up . i bet if you watch again sometime later , you ' ll find it a little better .
i never get too wild into the marvel movies . seems like you always know how it ' s going to end . to me , they ' re good , not great . and they can get repetitive .
i get it , i think i ' d like to go back and re ##li ##ve the big events . i miss those the most , football games and dances .
yeah , there wasn ' t much to worry about except classes and whatever drama was going around at the time !
my girlfriend always likes to wait until the needle is past empty . i never let it get past half - way empty . i don ' t get how she deals with that stress in her life ! and to me , it makes no sense . but i guess she hates spending the money on it , so she waits .
one time , she actually forgot to turn the car off while pumping gas . she just stuck the thing in , and went inside the shop . i was in the passenger seat . . . i stopped , looked for a second and thought , " wait , can you do that now . . . ? "
well that ' s nice of you to do that for them . i bet they enjoy the treat .
maybe you could try putting it on a cute bird feeder so it ' ll be a little easier for them ?
they might ' ve taken out a loan they can ' t afford .
at least it ' s paid of and you don ' t have to worry about payments on it .
what ' s that ? drink ?
bad or genius ?
oh that sounds awful . i am sorry you had to see that .
that ' s good that you can see a positive in that . you must be a very strong person .
i would be too , i never win those things !
very true ! cong ##rat ##s ! it ' s hard to never win
yes , i ' m sure it makes you anxious . but , no sense in worrying !
i know it ' s probably hard not to worry . but , it really doesn ' t change the outcome , ya know !
cheer up buddy , it ' s all in the mind
i believe there must be a good thing that happened these past few years . count the good ones and block the bad memories out
by being a decent person . . . i ' m not a cheat ##er and could never . . i am very mono ##go ##mous . . why would you get married if you wanted that ?
i think so . having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that , would you want to be cheated on ? you should be honest with your partner . . or work on and water your relationship if you don ' t like it the way it is . cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone else ##s life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal .
what happened ?
on purpose ?
that ' s great . how long was he gone ?
wow . was he hurt at all ?
that is a good feeling
i do agree with you
i bet ! i am glad you have a good relationship with a sibling ! that ' s rare ##r nowadays
how far are you guys apart in age ?
that ' s terrible , i ' m sorry to hear that .
i hope she makes it up to you .
i love shrimp na ##cho ##s , but any na ##cho ##s are good really
what do you put on your na ##cho ##s ?
wow , that ' s really extreme . you should feel bad about it .
what do you need to leave ?
how cool is this ? i won free ice cream for a year from my local cream ##ery !
it was a raf ##fle !
i can understand that ! i actually attempted a diet about a month ago , and it was miserable . what made you give it up ?
that seems like the best option . it is hard to stick to a diet for a set amount of time . the weight always seems to return .
did you roll down your window and yell at him ?
gag ##ging ? so you don ' t do that ?
oh really ? is that your favorite month ?
that sounds like a lot of fun ! which mountains ?
i love pizza
i am sorry
its hard to find people to help move .
that ' s good that your brother helped . my daughter i moved alone .
was he hurt ?
oh that ##s good
oh no ! did you end up finding out who did it ?
i would go to hr about it and let them know .
how come ?
oh no ! your friends didn ' t offer to buy you a drink or something ? i would if i wanted my friend to come
that sounds delicious ! how nice of her !
she sounds like it ! you ' re lucky to have such a caring mom !
what is the name of your band ?
that ' s a lot . what kind of music do you play >
where ' d they go ?
it takes some getting used especially since you haven ' t been alone in a while .
what kind of shoes ?
converse go with everything too !
i love the beach . we can only go once a year !
well . you will get back there .
that is sad . sometime pets are ii ##rre ##pl ##ace ##able .
what was her name ?
i am sorry , that is terrible
you will get through it
sorry to hear that . what age group
ha ##h . . that ##s cool
that would be great . they don ' t tell you in advance , you just have to find out when you get the check ?
that ' s good and bad i guess . it would probably be nice to be able to plan on it .
that is nice , the ones i use play the same songs over and over !
i agree , and most of the music is older music , too .
oh no , that ' s so awful . were you able to recover ?
ye ##a . that would make me cautious as well . i hope nothing like that happens again to you .
i ' d be mad too ! do you have any idea who could have stolen it ?
that ' s terrible . well you know what they say about karma , they ' ll get theirs eventually .
don ' t go check ! lo ##l
oh lo ##l . well if you have a weapon keep it near you .
why ?
that is definitely a no - no
oh wow ! what did they get ?
wow cam ##aro ##s are awe ##som . i just got a new suv
why he is so much better then the other option . i mean they were all crazy but i can ' t imagine a regime under clinton .
honestly they are both crazy . it ' s a sad time when those two were the best we had to offer .
i would hate that
i would too
oh that ##s sweet . is he paying for insurance too ? : )
oh well . . at least you got some wheels . . beats taking the bus or walking
why do you do that
that is not too bad
i know that feeling
it is the worst . my landlord take forever to get things fixed .
awesome ! what are you studying ?
that ##s a great career ! we need good counselor ##s in schools !
i am so sorry to hear about your dog , did you rescue her ?
i bet so , i am glad you were able to save her !
jesus lord . . . i hope you kicked her out or left !
she is a ( fill in the blank ) she cheated and betrayed you and your marriage . . . she would never win in court after cheating . i am so very sorry . there is nothing like being betrayed by someone you love
did you call an animal shelter ?
did you give him some food ?
oh no ! did every one hear ?
that ' s so bad lo ##l
that ' s great ! i wish mine did but they ' re dread ##ing their first day back tomorrow .
maybe it will , i ' ll keep my fingers crossed for you !
oh that ##s good . . did you get to keep some pictures ?
wow that was a good idea
oh i am sorry to hear that , but i am sure there might be an even better one out there for you .
it ' s a tough , going through the job market in general . persistence is the key . you ' ll get one .
i can understand that . it can be quite scary .
that is a long time to not be alone !
can ##gra ##tula ##tions ! ! ! ! is this your first child ?
that will be the best christmas present ever !
that ' s never a fun situation , i always bring someone .
meet somewhere public like a store parking lot .
the en ##ti ##tlement everywhere is terrible ! did you find out who did it ?
well . . you could put a box of something that looked good and put " don ' t touch " and put exploding ink in it - then you will know ; )
did you call the cops ?
that sucks . karma will come
oh ! mine broke too this past weekend but i got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil . i am glad yours is fixed !
yes $ 200 is expensive . it is always good to fix them if you can , especially for the nice ##r ones
oh man doesn ' t that just make you want to take a car and run right . . . . . just kidding . . but yeah that would make my blood boil
yes ! i agree ! i guess a lot of people say 3 strikes and your out , i ' m done , but for me , i don ##t care who you are , i just don ##t give even second chances to most people !
i love christmas
does everyone live far apart ?
i know what you mean because i do it too
ha ##ha ##ha you don ' t say : )
but now you have a new pet to live with you
ha ##ha i love them . they eat other pest like bugs and mice . wait until you cat dose that again .
that sounds fun ! do you have a boat or jet ski ##s ?
oh for sure ! i love riding jet ski ##s !
that is great to hear . what is making you so happy ?
great news . kids are always an exciting adventure !
that was very nice of her . what did you do with the money ?
that is a good use of the 100 bucks . i am sure you will pay it forward at some point .
yeah , they ' re sometimes hard starts to the week . did anything bad happen to you this monday , or was it just slow - moving ? hopefully things pick up for you .
man , that ' s terrible . i ' m sorry to hear that . hopefully you can recover .
oh no , i have been there ! i hope everything goes okay !
don ' t worry about it , worrying will only make things worse .
oh no ! were you home when it happened ?
i ' m so glad you weren ' t there but i still hate to hear it . did they take anything valuable ?
i understand . i don ' t like bad weather either .
was it a tornado ?
what kind of band
i like that music
u ##gh i hate when people do that ! did they even leave a note ?
of course . well karma will get them one day . at least it wasn ' t a full on accident where you could ' ve gotten injured .
oh wow . . i call that a win !
that ##s awesome
i bet it can be easy for that to happen in the spur the moment
you ' ll have a shot at it again , i ' m sure !
what is that ? a video game ?
no worries , we all have our ho ##bbies !
aw ##w . i can imagine that its really different now in the house .
i felt the same av ##out my mom ##s dog when he passed . something was missing in the house .
i hate that ! where they ' re probably friendly , but because they ' re so big , you have no idea what could or would happen , so you get so defensive . .
my brother has a large lab , although they ' re pretty sure it has to be part of something else , because it ' s over a hundred pounds and looks much bigger than a normal lab . she ' s a sweet dog , has the energy of a puppy though , so she comes tearing at you with speed and you think you ' re about to die . . but she ' s just being playful .
i ' m sorry to hear that . what ' s been going on ?
tr ##ou ##bling times do make us extra vulnerable .
any g ##f or bf ? that would be scary yet wonderful !
i would take someone who would be thrilled about it : )
oh no . . . that should be reserved for the worst prisoners . that hurts !
that ' s understand ##able . i bet people have had those stuck in their feet before
oh no no no no no ! that ##s no man ! if you aren ' t going to fix it then earn money to hire someone who will !
yes ! i would agree ! i feel bad your in that situation !
ye ##a it can really hit hard
ye ##a i know how you feel
what kind of job is it ?
wow ! that takes a lot of schooling , i hope you do too ! is it a good company ?
why are you happy
i am happy for you
i have been there before . sometimes you just need to relax !
it is , we all need time for ourselves !
what are you studying ?
oh wow that sounds impressive . good luck !
that is awesome ! are you going to celebrate ?
how fun ! i hope you have a great time !
what kind of game is that
it sounds cool
and what was the verdict ?
hard work goes a long way !
i love days like that ! hopefully you got a chance to play outside ? ! ; - )
so fantastic that you could take advantage of it - - * and * get to make some memories with your kids !
yes technology is great
ye ##a and now smart phones are everything !
why did it ir ##k you ? was he not suppose to be there ?
have you confronted him about it yet ?
did you not pass ?
awesome ! i am happy for you !
kids are the best
that sounds very nice
aw , that ' s no good , are you going to buy new ones or patch them up ?
sorry to hear that , hopefully someone will help you out with that .
nothing to be ashamed about . there are lots of people much older that are still into gaming . if you ' re really good you could actually make money on it !
ha ##ha ##ha . nothing says you can ' t do both . work at work , play after work .
that was really nice of them , they are good co workers
that ##s very heart warming to hear
how ' d it go ?
sounds like an old coaster they should consider replacing .
that sounds exciting ! are you going to see him for the holidays ?
i hope you have a great time !
what school are you applying to ?
that is a tough school to get into . best of luck .
that ' s pretty cool . how long have you been together in this relationship
well have a safe flight and make sure you make the most of it !
oh , that ' s . . . interesting . that does sound like a nice change of plans , not only because starbucks not seem that fun anyway . hopefully she returned the favor ?
well , hopefully she doesn ' t keep you waiting for very long , if everything else is right ! but maybe be more patient than even you think you need to be in order to play it safe , so she doesn ' t get scared off , so to speak . sounds like it will be worth it in the end .
why don ' t you get one then , so cute .
that sucks . i hope that changes in the future for you .
that really stink ##s . maybe they will take the hint ?
well that ' s good !
that ' s awesome to hear !
that ' s good news . congratulations in advance !
why do you say that
that is not your fault
she must have a golden heart
i hope you have showered her with gifts and appreciation , she deserves it
ye ##a , this is a much better time for content
ye ##a i can see that also
oh no . did anything happen ?
hopefully , you won ' t have to walk when it ' s dark out again or at least have people to walk with you .
do you guys still keep in touch with video chat ##s and phone calls ?
that ##s what helped me when i moved away . video chatting makes it feel like your ##e still there
what is so creepy
i am sure you are fin ##r
oh no , what happened ?
it happens , you can ' t beat yourself up about it , it was an accident !
that sucks . are you going to tell your boss ?
well that ' s a good attitude
congratulations ! that is an awesome ac ##hi ##ev ##n ##ment
that is always a perfect combo !
that is bad . did you do it on purpose ?
mistake can easily happened . nothing to worry about .
how was the game !
that ##s cool
why were you impressed
i am not sure it was
that would have made me sad , poor kitten
i love animals , i would feel the same as you
wow surprise gifts are the best !
what a good friend . i ' m glad you had a good birthday
i do as well
what happened then
is he doing better ?
well that ' s good . i bet he appreciated you taking care of him ,
that is sweet and sentimental .
i am happy that you have that to remember him by .
was it a birthday party ?
oh congratulations !
oh man , i forgot about crack ##er jack ##s . i always looked for the prize
it always makes me think about baseball when i think of crack ##er jack ##s
oh no , that must have ruined the round !
hopefully you got a ref ##und .
i am hoping as well
that would be very nice
sounds like a good friend to have by your side
that ##s good !
that ##s understand ##able ! just be yourself and im sure you will do great !
a tip someone gave me once is to make sure to have really good posture as it makes you appear less nervous ! fake it till you make it ! good luck !
oh no , that classic prank ! i bet that was painful , i ' ve only seen it on movies .
ha ##ha , wow , that ' s awesome . sort of makes up for him playing that prank on you .
cheer up buddy , everyone have experienced that at one point or the other
no worries buddy , the experience will make you stronger
for a test ? it ' s good that your confident , that ' s key !
you ' ll get the highest grade , i ' m sure !
oh that ' s good ! any special reason ?
oh that is wonderful news ! congratulations !
making new friends can be tough , is there anyone at work you bond with ?
i am sure that you will meet some new friends @
that is amazing , is there a certain reason she can ##t swim , she just never learned ?
was her life jacket fancy ?
that must ' ve been terrifying in your dream .
i hope you don ' t have many of those dreams again .
did you pass ?
hard work pays off !
why were you scared
i do as well
wow sounds like you need a new store . . ha ##ha
do you wear glasses or do you have 20 / 20 vision
that ##s good , give it some time , did everything go good , besides the high and dry ?
that sounds good , give it time , she will come around .
i ' m so sorry , are you okay ?
i hope you will feel better .
i did see that
he won ##t win anything
i ' ll keep my fingers crossed that it ' s good for you ! is that your favorite food ?
i didn ' t know it was healthy !
curious ##ity gets to ya sometimes .
ha ##ha ##ha so why did you watch it ?
that is such a bomber , will you still be able to go on your trip ?
that ' s not good at all , have you tried asking for someone ##s car ?
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that .
i ' m sure it was . did ins ##ura ##ce cover what was lost ?
i hope you do , too ! i have always hated group work .
i guess so , i just hate that my grade would depend on someone else ' s work . . or lack there of .
that is great , what school did he go to ?
wow that is a tough school to get into . did you pay the tuition ?
that is so annoying . i thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore .
i heard they are based outside of the country and make calls out of reach of the law . like i said , annoying !
im sorry to hear that . . old age ?
he lived a long life .
oh no , were you able to track it down ?
aw sorry to hear that , hope he / she is fine and you ' ll able to find it .
i bet that was nice
i am sure you will
i am so sorry for your loss . how was was he ?
he had a good life , ye ##a ?
were you scared
i would be too
it ' s not good to be jealous of your friends .
i ' m glad you made that connection .
gee that ' s sucks . have you tried contact ##ing them ?
that ' s terrible service . i hope you get it resolved soon !
wow . i guess she really has no care for social construct ##s .
it would make me lose my appetite . oh well , what could you have done ?
why are you hesitant
then just tell him no . if it ' s meant to be he ' ll respect it
yes and staying away from addict ##s is always good as well ! pick a different hobby for sure that ' s healthy is good !
yes ! i used to be very social but i have had enough of that and now i am happy to be at home and at peace : 0
what game was it ?
oh that sounds fun ! did you go in person or watch on tv ?
that was nice of them
i bet you were
it is good to find some time for ours ##el ##f to rest .
that is great .
that ' s really rude of them , i guess no one taught them manners .
someone else should have looked out for you , though .
that ' s very sweet to even reach that age and to retire ! i hope he gets to do fun things now ?
you don ' t know ?
it has been long
i do too
i agree . i put a lot of effort into my work and i hate when things are half done .
i am sorry ! i have been there before and it is no fun !
wow that ##s super exciting . i hope you do too . what would you go for ?
very nice . i think you ##ll get it . i believe in you
that ' s very nice of her , not too many left that would offer to do that for a stranger .
that ' s really cool , hope you two become bf ##fs !
oh no ! im sorry , i have been there before too many times . just know everything happens for a reason
good ! i try my best to live by that . its hard sometimes though , life is weird .
well that ##s not good
i guess you did
must ' ve been em ##bara ##ssing .
were you walking and suddenly tripped on something you didn ' t see ?
oh man , how come ?
oh that is a bum ##mer , maybe you can around work as it ' s worth it : )
oh no . did you take out a pay ##day loan ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . well , i hope it ' s over with soon .
i hear they are good
they are talented for sure
what did your brother do ?
that ' s really nice of him . sounds like you won the sibling lottery .
wow that ' s nice . how was the taste ?
oh i see ! still , a great gesture to get a cake .
your roommate is awesome . i ' m glad you weren ' t stranded .
i had horrible room ##ates . i ' m glad you gotta keeper .
that ' s creepy , do you think you ' re in trouble for something or is it someone random ?
i would do so just as a pre ##ca ##ution , can never be too careful !
i feel the same way ! i mean , my facebook feed is full of all this garbage .
i actually use a special extension on my browser so i can block certain things like this on my facebook ! you should try it !
you must be nervous , but im sure you will be fine
ha ##ha ##ha that might be a small pro ##ble , but nothing to be worried about
dan ##g ! i hate when that happens . it ' s always the day you don ' t expect it to happen , it happens .
that ' s always a nice alternative , could be worse .
oh man , i should do that , too .
that ' s good . what did you get for preparation ?
oh , i ' m so very sorry ! i know it ' s very hard to lose a loved one , i lost my sister , father , and both sets of grandparents .
yes , even though it ' s part of life , it doesn ' t make it any better when it happens . i hope it starts to get better for you soon .
nice where are you headed
that ' s pretty awesome : ) is it your whole family going , or just you and a significant other
wow sound serious . you do this everyday ?
that ##s a nice commit ##tment you got there . cong ##rat ##s
i would love that car
i am in the same boat
what game will you be going to ?
i love baseball , who is playing in the game you are going to ?
not a lot of people are loyal . who is this someone ?
being a punching bag in a relationship is no good . it ' s a 2 way street . is your partner doing their part ?
that ' s pretty awesome ! i feel my skin jump a bit when i see how much people spend on one day
i feel the same ! no use spending that on something that will be eaten either
oh , how do you feel about that ?
are you going to allow it then ?
how did they feel about that ?
i can understand not wanting a big wedding , i wish i would have made a different decision . good for him .
that is such a noble thing to do . do you work with an organization or on your own .
that makes sense . well , you are doing a lot of good .
wow , that ' s great ! how old is he ?
that ' s great , it can take awhile for boys to get the hang of it all .
that is very lucky
i am glad she did
that ' s awesome that your dad helped you out with math .
was ? is he no longer around ?
that ' s so sad ! i ' m glad you have something to remember him by .
he will always live on through spirit in your heart . i ' m sorry for the loss .
ah , that ' s too bad . but exciting at the same time ! do you have a particular car in mind ?
yes , i heard the same thing ! cheap on parts too !
i would have been as well , going on vacation is really fun . are you going with family ?
that is really fun place to go with family , i was there last year and really enjoyed it
well i hope that it turns out well !
yeah that makes a lot of sense . good thinking !
wow . sounds like you have a wonderful boss . sarcasm by the way .
is he always this way ?
its just a boat
i can get that sometimes
seems like a silly thing to be nervous about , unless you ' re a terrible driver .
well , to each their own . they have driving classes if you ever feel like you need them .
that ' s amazing . what was the meeting about ?
you earned it ! good job !
that was nice of her . how did it come out ?
awesome . what color is it . happy birthday by the way !
i am with you on that one
i hate it
congratulations to him . is he younger or older ?
ah so you ' re the young one . do you look up to him ?
you need to ind ##uld ##ge every once and awhile , right ?
i heard they can keep you from hitting a plea ##te ##u .
aw sorry to hear that . . . why is she moving
nice well if you keep in touch everyday maybe it won ' t feel so far
oh ye ##a ? did you try to keep up with him ?
ah that ##s true
that must have been fun ! i love dogs . what kind was it ?
fun , i have a friend who has one of those . they ' re very playful .
it was ? what made it hard specifically ? hopefully nothing too bad happened .
yeah , i ' m with you . i hate going to especially wal ##mart , because it ' s so freaking crowded all the time . it ' s a has ##sle getting even the shortest shopping list . but i ' m on a budget and it ' s where i have to go .
thanks for the awesome tip . i appreciate you trying to think of an alternative for me ! i ' ll give it a look .
very true ! maybe a gi ##ote ##r and she needs more minerals , that ##s what it is a lot .
yes ! research is a life save ##r , never just rely on doctors . . they almost killed me and many i know . i hope it ' s not too bad !
almost all my family members have smoked at one point in time . i feel bad for the people that get caught in the addiction , and i wish i could help them quit . sorry to hear it ' s such a has ##sle enough that you had to do it inside .
hey , i really hope you do . it was partly why my dad had a stroke and then had health problems the rest of his life . but i ' m sure you get that all the time . you have to do it for you , not because of horror stories and all that . i hope you get through it , though .
aw , i ' m sorry to hear that , is she getting up there in age ?
hopefully they will dia ##gno ##se her correctly and she becomes her normal self . fingers crossed !
is it working well still
its nice to have
how ' d it go ?
i ' m glad you ' re getting used to it now .
oh ye ##a , the tesla ##s look pretty amazing !
maybe they ' ll be more affordable and even slick ##er when you get around to it .
that ' s a very supportive family you have . i ' m right there with you on the credit , mine is not too good .
make sure you tell them you love them when you see them next ! : )
that ##s super sketch ##y of him . i never accept checks from people . only cash . just in case
hopefully you will still get the money
i do not like mine as well
that is annoying
how was it ?
i have no idea what kind of ingredients you even put in a mug cake ?
pretty much they have problems in their own lives .
yep . if people were true ##ly happy , they wouldn ' t have time to troll others .
that ' s awesome . sounds like you were well prepared for it .
that ' s great ! congratulations on getting it !
oh that ##s nice . do you all have plans ?
that sounds great .
that sounds fun ! do you have a first date planned ?
ah okay , good plan . i ' m sure she will go out with you . just don ' t sound too desperate .
wow . must be a sight for those behind you all this time .
it ' s ok . i ' m sure everyone has their em ##bara ##ssing moments .
that is awesome . it is great when a schedule works out .
you know that ' s right . i love food , although i just recently became a vega ##n .
i wish i had a car .
only if i find the money
i am sure it will
i bet it smells nice
that sucks . maybe there ' s a next time ?
i hope you ' ll get another opportunity or even a better one .
how did you do that can you remember the last place you had it ?
i know was it an important sentiment to your family ? i hope it comes up eventually .
why is that
that does sound fun
my brother used to always do that to me .
family should help as much as possible .
maybe you should try making some again
ah ok
that ' s awesome . job hunting can be difficult .
i feel sorry for th 19 people who didn ' t get it .
i bet it will be okay
it happens to everyone
have you talked to him about it ? why wouldn ' t he be able ?
ah , work always seems to find a way to get in the way .
heck yeah ! i love the fair , mainly for the food and people watching !
yu ##m ! don ' t forget about the corn ##dog ##s .
is it a pretty decent raise ?
i ' ll keep my fingers crossed that it happens for you . i don ' t think a boss would give a hint like that for no reason !
that ' s terrible . did you find your dog ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you find him soon .
who won
ah sounds like the smart move
what i that ? ! ? ! i think iv ##e heard the name before maybe .
i see , what happened ? bad recipe ?
oh god . that ' s awful . i guess she never came back ?
i hope she was able to fen ##d for herself . i ' m sorry she went through that loss .
i wish i could make that type of money !
money is what runs the world .
cool cong ##rat ##s i can never win those
well aren ' t you the lucky the le ##pre ##cha ##un . . . how much have you won so far
why is that
that is cool i guess
that is the story of my life .
the weekends are for the boys !
gotta hate weather like that when you ' re trying to get somewhere . you ok ?
that ' s good . so many pe ##ole just drive faster .
she seems work hard
that is sad
she ' s one lucky girl !
how long have you guys been together ?
hopefully you do , and remember the movie trailers and commercials take a while before the actual movie plays
do you have a date ?
why ? what ##s going on this weekend ?
oh my go ##sh that ##s exciting . you ' re going to have such a fun time . i love roller coaster ##s
and if you need to , just close your eyes
what is happening friday ?
o ##oo ##h that ' s exciting ! i hope you get good news on friday ! !
they must be a really good rest ##ura ##unt
those are definitely reasons to keep going back ,
i bet ! cong ##rat ##s
that was awesome of you all
did you end up going out ?
i ' m so happy for you .
that sounds so gross
it sounds that way
i love sauce ##s like that
i do agree
oh yu ##m ! i love cake ! that was nice of her !
ill bet it was ! i hope you thanked her ! cake takes time and effort to make !
that sounds exciting ! the hard work will pay off . i ' ve always wanted to camp . have you done it before ?
is it just you , or will others be joining you ?
i ' ve really glad you and your do are getting along well . dogs are mans best friend after all !
yeah but it is worth it because now you have a loyal and obe ##die ##nt partner .
wow . what happened ?
that ' s gotta be em ##bara ##ssing .
that is awesome , normally it is the opposite !
your dog is an angel !
sounds like a goal to me . good luck !
you ' re welcome . goals is what makes life matters sometimes .
i ' m eating some pepper ##oni pizza as i ' m typing this . . washing it down with some beer , my kind of tuesday night
what are your default pizza ##s . mine are little c ' s or domino ##es
was the dog okay
i am glad you did
did they ?
that ##s good
that ' s awesome ! you and me can go eat !
hopefully it is a great place to eat and we enjoy it !
i agree !
yeah they are horrible
reminds me of when i was younger , but i always acted like i liked it to make her happy .
just make sure you drop the hint in a nice way !
that ' s a long drive .
any way for you to maybe go to them next time ?
what kind of car is it ?
nice ! i would secretly be a little en ##vious myself , they are nice cars .
it will figure itself out , always does
i am sure it will be
what happened ?
did find your dog ?
what are you going to do with it ?
oh that ##s cool
that is the way to go ! keep it up !
work is pretty great and makes a bunch of money !
that is crazy
that is funny
that ' s some dedication !
good luck ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great !
i would have cried for multiple days !
do you have a new place to eat ?
that ' s no fun . i had a cat that would escape all the time too . did you get it back ?
that ' s not too bad . i had to pick mine up at the animal shelter .
i hope you do well
i can tell
that ' s not cool . will you get it fixed ?
sounds like a plan .
that is bad
i can imagine
i would have been to . what happened ?
oh , well that happens
where were his parents ?
ah that stink ##s
aw ##w ! maybe it ' s time to start building yours !
maybe you should start saving up some extra money so you can make yours better ! !
that is a good thing
she sounds amazing
oh yu ##ck ! sounds like a disgusting experience .
ha ##ha that must have felt a bit satisfying at least . glad you took care of them .
right on , glad to hear it . i hate utility bills and how unexpectedly high they can be . i especially hated living with roommate ##s who didn ' t mind getting them really high , just for the sake of having it a little cooler .
i hope it stays that way for you . luckily i ' m in an apartment now where the utilities are included , so i don ' t have to stress about what it ' s going to be , or confronting my roommate ##s .
marriage is a very hard thing .
i like all of my partners too much .
oh ##h yeah , that sounds really good .
i see , what are you going to do to make sure it doesn ' t happen again ?
that ' s terrible ! why did you feel scared ?
oh no , i always feel the same way . i usually avoid areas like that .
oh that ##s good that he felt comfortable enough to tell you
that ##s cool that he was able to come out on his own terms
that ' s ra ##d , those are slick looking cars !
it ' s time to one up him and get a porsche !
it is a good thing that you care .
i wish i lived in your fine community .
sounds like you prepared well , congratulations ! what do you think you got ?
that ' s always a good sign . when you feel good about it , you did well .
oh man ! i would also be ira ##te . why the delay ?
i hate fight delays
date them both ? then pick which one you like the most .
you should bite first and take them both home !
that ' s too bad . . you sure it was the milk and not something else ?
can you drink any dairy ? or is that totally off limits
did you kick him in the shen ?
okay , maybe punch him in the nose .
then what happened ?
i didn ' t understand you .
did you do well
you will do better next time
did someone punch you ?
maybe someone kicked you in the eye !
i don ##t believe that
just don ##t give up
there is no such things as happy days
happy days fly away so quickly .
oh no , that ' s terrible ! do you know who did it ?
i hope it ' s not too expensive to fix !
well that ##s gross
i can only imagine
that ' s a real positive spirit !
i like your attitude .
hopefully it ' s not a big one that would cause serious damage , i assume ? otherwise , i kind of like storms . i like the sound of rain , and the visual aspect . it ' s the best when you get to fall asleep to them .
i live near the coast , and we have hurricane scares all the time . for some reason , people love to stay behind and just face the storm . they ' re fearless and think everything will be okay , even when sometimes it ' s not . i guess they ' re just determined to stay by their homes and not abandon them , which i can understand . i ' ll hope for the best for you !
i ' ve never had the guts to do that , even though i ' ve wanted to on multiple occasions . what happened , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
that ' s the worst . . . so it wasn ' t even just taste , it was about health . . dan ##g . i don ' t know if i could ever go back there again . it ' d always be in the back of my mind . glad you caught it early and didn ' t go home with too much food poisoning .
that is good . i always loved sports as a kid and did well
it is a great way to learn that . im glad i was able to learn those values .
i agree . . . . were you just looking through some photos or what
sm ##h time flies now that you mention it . . . i was just going through old f ##b beach pic ##s of me and an ex i was planning to marry but we fell off and it hits me like a sucker punch every time
congratulations ! what do you do ?
sounds like you have some real talent there . keep up the good work . i bet you ' ll be famous one day !
what is it worth ?
ha ##h that ##s awesome . . canceled of course . . but awesome
i do not even have a dog
i have always wanted one .
i am glad it was resolved .
i sure hope that happens .
that ' s awful news ! i don ' t want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life . you could look at it like a second chance .
yeah , that happened to my roommate recently . i didn ' t try to give him too much specific advice , because most of it is just useless . i just tried to help him realize the best he can do is be patient , because time makes everything feel better , or at least hurt less .
con ##rat ##s . what did you get ?
oh nice
why what happened ?
i would feel the same way
now i feel bad about talking to you . do you mind talking to me ?
who are these people ?
is it your baby .
we will see once the baby comes out and is tested !
i feel that way every day almost , did you ever end up doing it ?
what made you so tired ? ?
did she find out you broke your promise ?
it ' s great that you both were able to work it out .
i love swimming !
no no ! forget those shorts ! be you !
nice . what was the award for ?
cong ##rat ##ulation .
she ##esh that ' s heavy . sorry to hear that . have you talked it over yet or no
well maybe it ' s for the best . good luck
you are not the only . nothing to worry about .
i am a guy . why this question ?
that sounds like a fun weekend ! did you go swimming ?
that sound fun ! i love to eat fresh fish !
hey that sounds like an awesome day !
good for you my friend ! we all need days like that !
oh no , poor little thing .
i am so heart ##broken thinking about it . i ' m sorry .
oh wow ! that is a lot of cakes ! ! will you be able to get it all done ?
well more power to you ! i don ' t think i could do that in one night - you must be a good baker .
man , i ' m jealous ! i ' m still a college student , barely paying rent ! and nothing but student loans to look forward to . i probably should have taken your path in life . not to say you haven ' t worked very hard for it , because i ' m sure you have .
hey i really appreciate that advice . i need to take it . i ' m horrible at setting goals . i just move in a general direction . i need to break things down step by step . we ' ll see how it goes .
sorry to hear that , my brother has a drinking problem too , and has kids , i love him but at this point we are more focused on the kids , i tell him if you get locked up who is gonna raise the girls , of course we are but still they need a father
all you can do is stay positive , all we can hope is our brothers will one day wake up before its to late
i never win and i play all the time !
this is very true !

oh you shouldn ' t be . don ' t eat before church though ; )
god it repaired ?
that ##s cool .
yeah , i wouldn ' t get too down . statistical ##ly , there ' s not much of a chance of ever winning .
yes i agree . i would be amazing to win the lottery .
it ' s good to always try and think positive .
that is a great attitude to have . it would be nice if more people saw it like that .
cong ##rat ##s on getting him that far ! what did he study ?
that ##s a great job to have in this world . i bet he is excited to get started working ?
getting out of work is the greatest feeling .

dan ##g , those things are creepy ! did it go away ?

have you tried contact ##ing the company about it ?
why what did they do to betray your trust ?
i would be so mad i dislike when company ' s charge my card did you call to get a ref ##und for the charge ?

ou ##ch that ' s bad . study hard . i ' m sure you ##ll do better next time

i hope you catch a big one ( or more ) - have a great time !

i hope he continues to improve . it ' s bad when a loved one is ill .

i am happy for you
ye ##a that can be hard when things remind you of people
sometimes you have to just look at the positive ##s though and smile about it
at least you had a lot of fun
well , they will get over it
what kind of project was it ? it ' s always satisfying to see hard work pay off .
i ' m sure you ' ll re ##ap the rewards at your job in the long term .

sounds like your ##e feeling pretty confident . i hope you get the promotion !
i think you will . just keep doing a good job and keep your confidence up .
yu ##ck . at least it wasn ##t in your house . that is gross .
i would be placing traps all inside my house in case it ever comes inside .
that must have brought back a lot of memories
good ones i hope .
that ' s great ! i need to start saving money , myself .
yeah it would be really nice to have some backup funds in case something happens .
poor dog , did he survive the impact ?
hopefully he survived the incident
is it because you are there for him ?
he would probably appreciate you doing that .
oh no . what is wrong ?
that is such a pain . do you have a credit card to use in the meantime ?
vacation ##s are the best . where are you going ?
iv ##e heard a lot of good things about austin , but iv ##e never been . iv ##e always wanted to go
did you have any damage ?
i ' m glad you came through it safely .
that has got to feel good ! did you get a raise or a new job ?
congratulations ! your life should feel a little less stress ##ful when you get it !
anticipation sucks . the hints don ' t help you figure it out ?
ha ##ha that ' s a shame . it ' s just like having to stare at christmas gifts for a month but not being able to open them as a kid .
these places should have them clean , because it is inevitably ; these things happen
there are jobs that are hard
you must be so proud . im sure she put in a lot of work to learn .
wow , so talented . that must make you very happy to see them do well at something .
what concert is it ?
what a pleasant surprise .
that sounds like a great memory ! i always get nos ##tal ##gic about pretty much everything . how long ago was it ?
i wish i had a group of friends like that . i always just knew people but never got close .
so peaceful and relaxing right ? what a beautiful sight .
i would too if i could sit outside and enjoy it like you !
oh that ' s great . is she going to col ##lge ?
what does she want to do ?
oh i hate people like that . people that fl ##ake out like that just have no respect for anyone else ##s ' time .
that sucks . you should have went out anyway ##s .
uh ##oh , i hope they don ##t have a late fee or anything attached to it
make sure you do it when you get home
sorry to hear that , try and keep busy or find a hobby eventually you will get over it , its just gonna take a bit of time
the gym is a great place to start , make new friends and get fit
whoa . that is a big change . that must make you so happy .
its probably muscle though so you will still look slim ##mer .
that ' s great when you have good main ##ten ##ce for a place .
that ' s such a waste of money and food . glad its working out though .
awesome ! cong ##rat ##ulation . so you are enjoying the job now ?
keep doing what your ##e doing ! i think you ##ll keep moving up that company ladder in no time
i have felt that . it always sucks feeling like you can
that ' s the worst . how do they expect people to get around ?
like ever before .
i ' m well mostly , but ready for fall to come .
and what happened next ?
why ? he did not do anything bad to you .
wow i would say the same ! accidents happen but come on pick them up . im sorry !
it really is un ##real , but you know people are getting worse and worse these days , .
wow how una ##pp ##re ##cia ##tive they sound . you will be better off at your next job i am sure .
im sure your next employer will be much better . that is no way to treat an employee .
i bet . it can be intimidating to start a new regime .
i should start back to working out . the older i get , the harder it seems to begin . do you have any advice ?
lo ##l , that would be awesome to get some free child ##care . my kids tend to drive me nuts at times .
yes , thank god that summer is finally over !
how long ago has this been ?
it never gets too far out of your memory . but it will fade over time . i doubt you ' ll still be feeling like this when you ' re in the nursing home .
does that happen often ?
and that usually knocks out the power ?
very cool of you to take a stand on something you believe in .
oh wow . that has to be hard to see . it ' s great they you are actually doing something about it .
$ 100 ! i have never won that much !
i wouldn ##t even know what to do with an extra $ 100
how did that end ?
well we give in to our friends . hopefully he pays you back and not ruin your friendship .
wow that ##s a long time to work together did ya ##ll meet at work ?
that ##s sad . im so sorry to hear that !
i know what you mean
there are other girls
that ##s awesome that you have saved all of that . i bet its heart ##war ##ming to look back at all of that stuff
you should get some good storage to ##tes and pack it all up so its safe
i know how you feel . one small decision could make everything nowadays different for you .
if you wonder how things would be different you ' d drive yourself nuts .
did you see any ghosts ?
i ' ve been to one of those . they sure find ways to get you !
what are you being tested for ?
well i hope you are okay ? did the doctor hint at anything ?
oh yeah is it nice ?
i know it sucks when people get what you need and its out of sight but i hope you get one soon !
that ' s great ! i bet you are very proud of them !
you ' re not ! : ) i ' m sure they will go to college and end up being very successful ##l
cong ##rat ##s ! when are you going ?
that sounds really exciting . are you taking someone along ?
cong ##rad ##ulation ##s . is this your first time moving in with a boyfriend ?
what are you worried about ?
i think i would be mad , too .
this chat has three people in it , it seems . i am talking to two separate worker _ 2 ' s .
ah that ##s sad . you must have look forward ##ed to the trip
there ' s always a next time .
i ' m so sorry ! it ' s always sad losing a friend .
i remember losing my childhood dog . they always stay in your hear .
it has been really dry here , as well . we are in a severe drought for the third time in four years .
5
that sounds like a lot of fun ! where are you headed to ?
i am a sucker for some good deals !
did you find a new job or retire ?
congratulations i hope you like it
her loss : ) i ' m glad you didn ' t get too stressed about there ##ject ##ion
it is . i remember all the drama from my teen years and how i was stressed and crying over really stupid stuff : )
i ' ve never seen that movie , why is it de ##pressing ?
oh wow , that is very de ##pressing . i hate movies like that .
now that ##s more de ##pressing , cheer up you eventually find better friends
not every person in the world is the same , we are all different i am confident you will find someone
congratulations ! are you going to celebrate ?
why does it take so long to kick in ?
that ' s too bad . is she feeling better today ?
i hope she feels better . that ' s never fun for mom or child .
were you able to find out what it was ?
be safe , they may come back .
were you expecting them ?
what a surprise ! i love when friends go above and beyond like that , it shows that they really care
i know i hear you . . . maybe one day we will win the lot ##to .
well i hope one day you get what you want : )
did you have some good food ?
that is awesome !
what happened today ? : )
that ##s great ! what will you guys do together ?
being helpless when waiting for things is the worst feeling . there ' s nothing you can do but you need to do something !
yi ##kes , that sucks . hopefully you found one that worked eventually .
your an outstanding mate and great friend , she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time
yes i still have dreams of my friend , and he passed 12 years ago , i will never forget him
that ##s so sad ! im really sorry . : ( have you been researching about it ?
i can ##t even begin to imagine how hard that must be . stay strong !
did she break anything ? how old is she ?
hopefully no breaks .
i agree , it is good to have something to look forward to .
i completely agree
what happened ?
but did you even hesitate and think about it ?
that ' s good to hear . is there any chance of promotion in the future .
are they hiring ? i could use a new job .
that is annoying . i wish public transportation was better in the city .
maybe see if you can do your grocery shopping to . maybe that will save you from having to do it later in the week .
what was it ? i ' m a music lover .
that is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the voyager probe .
that ##s terrible to hear . . . : ( when did you find that out ?
u ##gh i don ##t even know how to respond to that other than to tell you to hang in there . lots of positive and love your way .
what sorts of places have you been going ? alone time is always great but then sometimes it gets to be too much so i understand .
you could always do that but maybe exploring on your own can give you a different perspective on things .
have you tried sharing it to your friends on social media ?
just keep crank ##ing them out . your videos will get better and your channel will grow . i know it can be annoying at first .
how do you think you did ?
i think you ' ll do just fine . do you still have to take the bar exam after ?
cong ##rat ##s ! that is so cool !
that is really something to be proud of !
that does sound like fun ! what is the came called ?
that sounds amazing ! you all must have really enjoyed playing it !
are you on wireless , or a wired network ?
wow , that sounds terrible . i really do hope you fix your internet problem .
congratulations . i bet you can ##t wait .
you are gonna do great . enjoy your time before you start work .
u ##gh i would be bum ##med too . don ##t give up tho !
i know , but you will have so many more summers coming up you got this
wow . have you studied for them ?
that is great ! what classes are they in ?
just enjoy as much time as you can with them , losing loved ones is never easy
that ##s sad to hear
that ' s fantastic . how old are you ?
keep up the good work .
oh no , why do you think like that . . all should be good
ah ok . if intuition tells not to fly . lets not take chance . you should skip the flight
i ' m sure you did great , do you have doubts that you didn ' t ?
it sucks having to wait for something like that , i know , but it will be here soon enough . try to relax .
that must be pretty frustrating
maybe you should have a talk with her
oh really ? what did they do ?
wow ! that was really nice of them .
how did you hurt it ?
that really sucks , i hope you feel better and can take her another day !
that is ridiculous ! that ' s annoying when people don ' t clean up after their dogs ! i love going to the local park with my son and there is dog po ##op in the grassy areas
it is , plus it ' s so anti ##san ##ita ##ry
you should ' ve called the police if they didn ' t listen to you
it sucks that you were forced to
has it been a long time ?
oh whoa . that is pretty crazy . hopefully ya ##ll can become friends again .
i would have been feeling the same way too . oh well maybe she thought it was cute .
no way ! come on . you are a champ walk back in there .
that is great , do they enjoy it ?
that is awesome , i am sure it makes you happy
oh no . i bet he felt really bad about it .
is it repair ##able at all ?
cong ##rat ##s ! how is it going ?
that ' s great , i ' m glad you are transition ##ing to something new so well .
that ' s great , how did you repay her ?
that would be a nice gesture
a surprise party that is awesome - did you have fun ?
im really happy for you
well that ##s part of being in the workforce , work when everyone is looking , hang out when they are not . most people aren ##t paid enough to care
sounds a bit harsh , but business is business
i could imagine . its a big day you both waited so long for .
im sure once it was over you realized that you would be okay with that .
old memories are the best . do you plan to go back again soon ?
that sounds good , hope you have a great time
that ##s so impressive ! you must be proud .
i would be too . that ##s amazing . good for her !
awesome , you saved yourself a ton of money by doing that !
yeah i could not imagine life without the internet
im sure that you will find another soon
im sorry , i read that wrong . i am very happy for you !
what was that ?
yu ##ck ! i don ' t think i ' d be able to hold back my own pu ##ke if that happened to me .
i know what you mean . there ##s some crazy stuff out there about it too !
the be ##ren ##stein bears one i think is crazy
what was it that happened to you ?
they are hungry little beast .
where are you getting lunch ?
that sounds fun ! are you going with anyone ?
im sorry that is awful
eventually you will feel better again
i bet that will go in the record books . how old is she ?
that ##s amazing . you must be proud . good for her !
what ' s it all about ?
sounds like she just needs some time to settle in , and catch her breath .
congratulations ! that ##s awesome . does he know what he ##s going for ?
wow , so he must be really smart then . make sure he doesn ##t do too much party ##ing like i did .
what happened ?

that ##s awesome i bet you were very thankful
that ##s what family is for
that ' s awesome ! i bet you ' re really proud of her .
i really hope that you continue to encourage her ! she may have a future as an artist .
what was that secret ?
all the best for your exams !
you need to take care of the elderly , i am sure she has cared for you your whole life
have you talked to her about this ?
then use her yard as a garbage can . that ' s what she does to yours .
i am sure it does . what kind of truck is it ?
sounds super cool !
hey ! yes , i do actually especially when it ' s nice out .
i carry it in my na ##lge ##ne wide mouth water bottle . what about you ?
is she far away from you now ?
oh , can you go across there and visit her ?
oh yeah what was that ?
that is super sweet of them ! so nice .
that was not very nice of him . did your parents react well ?
what a mean thing to do .
yeah , i ' m taking care of her for the last few months .
yeah i should
could you help her out once in awhile ?
well that is really consider ##ate !
ha ##ha , you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it
ye ##a that ##s a good idea . be like , hopefully i don ##t spill this one on me too
what do you have coming up ? ill keep you in mind .
just have confidence . it sounds like you already know the outcome . if she says no just don ##t make a big deal out it .
what was it that you did to feel so courageous ? ?
that is well worth taking a chance on since the risk of rejection did not happen and the pay ##off was a good outcome . she said yes !
ha ha ha that ##s a good one tho ! your parents tho om ##g . that ##s funny but i am sure it wasn ##t in the moment .
i know i would have been super upset in the moment .
was everything okay ? did it take long for the power to come back ?
that is scary ! i hope nothing came inside
are you pretty bad with math ?
well maybe you will get a good overall grade and pass !
is it a hurricane or something worse ?
oh no , stay indoors for sure !
that ' s awesome ! what kind of car is it ?
yeah , i ' m jealous . you ' re so lucky !
i know it was terrible . are you from vegas ?
u ##gh well i hope no one in your family was affected
that is great i am so happy for you , what industry are you in ?
that ##s all that matters , and your happiness
oh my god , that ' s terrible .
well , i will pray for you , and i hope our advanced medicine and doctors can cure him .
keep your head up and ask around if anyone has op ##pur ##tu ##ni ##tes for you
it will get better , its always darkest just before the dawn
that happens sometimes . how did you end up doing in the end ?
don ' t sweat it . there ' s plenty of other competitions that you can try again at .
yeah , it ' s price ##less moment . being a mother , i can understand your feelings .
each birth is special irrelevant of first or second . i am happy for you though
what are you doing now ?
that is awesome , good for you !
are you serious
does he still have your car
yes it does , take advantage of the time you have now
reach out to them and see how they are !
that ##s awesome . i love getting money as a gift . then you get to spend it how you want
paying off debt is where i am now . its hard work , but so worth it
that ##s awesome i can ##t wait to have kids !
i bet !
oh no , did you see who did it ?
dar ##n , i hope your insurance covers it
that ' s unfortunate . what made you so scared of it ?
there were no lights in the basement ?
i ' m proud of you ! i attend both sunday and wednesday nights each week
god is always there for you and always will be .
are you going to keep her ?
is she a brown dogg ##y ?
that ' s great ! what kind of project is it ?
making money ' s always good ! do you think it ' ll be a success ?
it is frustrating to watch i ag ##re
that is unfortunate , hopefully you can give them guidance
were they your children ?
i would be too . i would have complained to staff .
what kind do you have at the moment
nice i love german she ##pha ##rds ! they are cute when pup ##pies and monsters when they grow up , my kind of dog
good for you , as an added bonus you are saving more money !
cigarettes are very expensive depending on where you live
at least you finally got one ! sometimes it helps not to focus too much on what everyone has has or has done .
i get it , everyone wants their first kiss like yesterday ! it ' s a big moment !
oh no , do you have a digital backup ?
its ok , you can always make new memories , it will not replace what you have lost , but it is a start
that ' s pretty messed up . why did you do that ?
are you going to tell her ?
that is awesome , what will you spend it on ?
good for you , make sure you get the 20 % down .
there is no " right place " to be for everyone . each person has their own individual path
i think that we are free to do as we want and we are in control of our fate .
oh really , what happened ?
oh wow , you must ' ve been pretty tired to make a mistake like that .
i have never seen it
i will check it out then !
aw , i really sorry to hear that . is is serious ?
i ' m sorry , at least you can rest assured knowing that your cat lived a long life .
that really sucks that that happened to you . maybe start by putting small amounts of trust in people
ha , sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself .
nice what kind of project was it
that ' s awe ##se ##ome . i ' m happy it turned out well . you must be pretty artistic
that is the best feeling ! i love getting a good deal on a great product .
sounds like it was a nice surprise : )
i know how you feel ! i ' m about to be 30 and i feel so old lo ##l
that ' s really great ! you are such an opt ##imi ##st , i need to learn from you : )
what were they being eliminated from ?
were the singers any good ?
wah ##t type of game is x game ?
ok , so was it fun ?
i ' m glad you had a nice trip . was it your first .
i would have thought it would be the other way around .
oh no ! did she miss school ?
well good thing she got there ! kids always tend to want to go to bed at the last minute and end up not sleeping enough or sleeping past their alarms !
oh man , fight club is a great movie ! i just recently saw it myself and was really surprised too .
i agree , that movie is definitely ahead of it ' s time !
that ' s cool . where at
that ' s awe ##se ##ome i ' ve always wanted to go to cal ##i . . . from the midwest , moved to tx to escape the des ##olate tun ##dra ha ##ha
do you like mexican style foods ?
oh did you tell your boyfriend about it ?
what kind are you looking for ? i don ' t know about you , but i hate car shopping !
i understand that . gas is so expensive !
oh where are you going ? is it a long trip ?
make a list and start packing for it a couple days in advance !
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . what happened ?
that ' s horrible . i am sorry for your loss .
did you help him to learn the swim techniques ?
how old is your son now ?
that ' s pretty awesome . . . were you happy to see one or were you nervous
oh man he must have been huge . . . did you get any pictures
oh wow , that ' s amazing ! i workout as well .
i actually injured my back a while back as well . i haven ' t gone to the doctor yet , though !
oh no , i ' m sorry for your loss . cats are such nice companions .
yes , time will help get over those feelings . do you plan to get another one ?
oh man i know how you feel . how old was your bird ?
that is horrible . take some time and gr ##ie ##ve . im always here if you need someone to talk to .
that is awesome ! do yo have to pay for heads ##tar ##t ?
that ' s great . my daughter is 3 , so i hope i can get her into a program like that !
that ' s cool . we saw it when it came out .
it was exciting .
what type of job do you have now ?
oh that is nice . do you have a website for your business ?
and what news would that be
best of luck friend
oh wow ! that would be so scary ! what happened ?
how far from shore were you ?
that ' s awesome , cong ##rat ##s ! do you have a job lined up for when you finish ?
yes , it will be nice to have a good pay che ##que coming in .
wow , that ' s a pretty cool hobby . just a small plane ?
yeah i always thought it would be fun to learn to do that .
ha ##ha , i ' ve seen plenty do wheel ##ies . i ' ve seen a few crash too , sadly
that takes a lot of nerve , so ku ##dos to that guy . i ' d never do that because i ' d probably die lo ##l
that ' s great ! don ' t be too nervous ! your date is most likely just as nervous as you are !
just try to have a fun time and let what happens , happen !
yeah they ' re great . super light and rigid . they feel kind of spring ##y when you ride them
do you have clip ##less pedal ##s on it ?
absolutely . it doesn ' t help that i ' m pretty intro ##verted .
i hate when you help someone out and they take advantage of you . i could never do that to someone .
why do you feel bad ? it is a tough decision for sure , but you should never have to feel bad about it .
i hear you on that , but the way it is right now , everything we do is destroying the environment , and i ' m sure you do plenty already to help . until electric vehicles are more affordable and reliable , you can ' t blame yourself for the choice . i ' m sure your words have affected others and made them re ##thi ##nk their choices , and all that helps and adds up .
blessing are another reason to be grateful !
how long were you married ?
that ' s really generous of her . she ' ll grow up to have pretty good karma
yes . i once helped out a friend in a car wreck . a month later i got a flat tire changed for free
oh man ! that ' s some jerry springer level drama . what happened ? did you tell him /
are they going to break up ?
oh man , that must have been humiliating ! did people notice ?
oh , man ! i ' m sorry to hear that . gotta be careful next time !
cong ##rat ##s ! how did you do it , and where do you work ?
my mom worked at a bank , and it ' s not as easy as you ' d think it ' d be , that ' s for sure . congratulations again !
everything is harder until we do it . and am proud of you for dona ##ting blood . it is one of the good habit of this human race i would say .
yeah am b + , o + is quite common and it can match for other blood group and o - ve is the opposite
you met johnny de ##p ? i have no idea , what happened ?
wow , that ' s pretty cool ! cong ##rat ##s ! that ' s a pretty exciting new thing in your life .
do you think they just didn ' t want to pay for your retirement ?
are you a part of the union ?
wow that ' s cool . . . with hers or your credit card . . ?
then she ' s a keeper for sure
so ##unce like you ' re a bit of an intro ##vert .
yeah , that gets old after a w ##hl ##e for me .
well that ' s awful . did you ask him why he didn ' t pick you ?
yes , i hope so too . it ' s nice to get promotions at work .
you must be so happy ! what kind of car ?
oh hell yeah ! i bet you ' re so thankful to your parents . enjoy your new car !
oh that ' s cool . glad it worked out for her
boy or girl ?
that ' s impressive but , 45 mag ##s are rare . are you sure it wasn ' t a 44 magnum ?
interesting . it is a real bullet .
oh no ! what happened ?
oh that is nasty ! what did you do ?
cong ##rat ##s , is your son very old or young ?
is he a sports player for the scholarships ?
holy crap ! did you see what it was ?
oh wow . should have taken pictures of it and used the internet to help you figure out what it was ! i ' d be curious .
oh no , did you get hurt very badly ?
i hope both our ego and your nose heal up quickly !
i ' m sorry . that must be difficult . i am glad you have pictures to hold on to though .
that ' s too bad you couldn ' t go , but memories are great to have !
oh nice ! hope you get it
best of luck !
that is absolutely amazing ! i ' m so proud of you ! you should be very proud of yourself as well
i ' m a stay at home mom and honestly it ' s the hardest job i ' ve ever had but the most reward ##ing one : ) i told my husband i want to keep having kids so i won ' t have to work again lo ##l
was there a big name event going on ? i ' ve seen the blue angles live
/ oh no , what happened , what ##s the problem with the provider
bad customer service . you should definitely switch
sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long , but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again
if they are really your friends , they won ##t care if you were bad
absolutely ! i ' ve always noticed that phenomena . if you act too desperate it actually puts them off . on the contrary , acting a little di ##sin ##ter ##ested gets them more interested .
i can agree with that . women like a man who is dedicated to something . it shows good char ##ace ##r .
that ' s cool . i ' ll have to try those out sometime
nice does it go well with any dip ? or is it better alone
its always a great time when that happens . my best friend and i moved away so i had ##ly ever see them now
it is , it makes all those memories just flood back
oh yes ! de ##ja vu has happened to me quite a bit ! it ' s eerie and cool huh ?
it ' s always intense running into ex ' s . i ' m glad your guys conversation went well and you guys could catch up .
he probably passed the infection to his mouth ! gross !
he needs to be qu ##aran ##tine ##d whenever he gets some kind of sickness , lo ##l .
oh awesome ! that ' s crazy , because my 30th birthday is next week , lo ##l . what makes you excited ? because i ' m dread ##ing mine .
ha ##ha ##ha , i guess that ' s true . for me it ' s pretty bad . i don ' t know if you ' re familiar with the internet term , but on my 30th birthday , i ' m going to be a " wizard " lo ##l .
i ' ve always wanted one of those ! i hope you enjoy it .
i ' ve tried some of the cheaper virtual reality heads ##ets , but i ' m sure they can ' t compare at all !
that would make me so mad ! what did you do ?
you should ! no one should have to clean up after someone else ##s animal .
im glad you made changes for the positive in your life . you can ##t go back into the past , but you can keep moving forward
what kind of changes have you made and why did you decide to make them ?
why do you think you ' ll get fired
do you plan on discussing this with your boss ?
that would be so scary ! did it work on the first try ?
i can ' t imagine . are you planning on going para ##chu ##ting again ?
oh sweet , i can ' t even imagine the excitement you must have . i hope everything works out for you !
we need more musicians who are about the music and bringing enlightenment to people . we got way too much commercial garbage on the radio . i really hope your message res ##onate ##s with people .
more than a couple of times .
that ' s not bad at all .
i would never go to that place again . did you go to a different place ?
that ' s horrible ! i ' m sorry to hear that . if i was you i would write a bad review on this restaurant ' s facebook page
i get you . i hate fighting but i ' m not going to be di ##sr ##es ##pe ##cted either .
i totally understand that .
hm i can relate to that ha ##ha
i ' m not always broke but i feel like what helps is leaving my credit / de ##bit card at home and just carry cash for what i need
that must have been really annoying . sucks to be a person who ' s on time dealing with people who don ' t care about being on time themselves .
did you say anything after they arrived ?
as long as it takes you from a to b and safe to drive that ' s all that matters : ) i used to have 1995 cam ##ry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car i ' ve had
i feel like those type of cars are the most reliable !
she spend all your ##e retirement money ? that ' s pretty messed up . why did she do that ?
are you going to divorce her ?
are you going to the police ?
sounds like a plan .
oh i hope you can find an alternative
sounds like you ' ll be alright after all
at least it ' s better than having nothing to use
i ' m sorry . how long had you been together ?
i hope you feel better soon .
oh no , is she on computer too much ?
you got a fair point . you would need to soft ##en her with something else other wise children ' s will keep ag ##gra ##vate you
o ##oh , awesome ! i bet everyone ' s excited ! i hope the future holds many more wonderful things for you !
ye ##a , some people really prove that hard work can pay off . i hope he enjoys the promotion !
have you gone on dates before ?
it could be that but some of my friends have said that with social media and online dating , it ' s harder and harder to truly connect with someone . there are a lot of people out there struggling .
i still think you made the right choice by going .
true . . but , who knows . . . maybe you ' ll make a new friend .
i am so sorry . that is heartbreak ##ing .
it ##ll take some time to gr ##ie ##ve . just make sure you have close friends and family nearby to talk to .
whoa , did it stink ? was it road ##kill ?
ha ##ha , man , i bet that was fun . poor sk ##unk didn ' t know what hit him .
what is making you have second thoughts ?
there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions .
as we say around here , you ain ' t lying ! how long were you waiting ?
we have all been there ! how hard would it be to put a few extra pens out ? they gotta be worth like what , a couple penn ##ies a pop ?
wow ! did you thank your mom or buy her any gifts on your trip ?
dan ##g ! can i get a hug too ?
wow , i bet that was nos ##tal ##gic . how ' d it feel seeing your old self doing fun stuff ?
ha ##ha , ye ##a , although some people i know haven ' t changed at all . i just miss the energy i had from when i was younger .
that ' s great . you must be excited . have you played all the smash bros games ?
that ' s pretty cool . i ' ve never played it before , what genre is it ?
that sounds fun i might have to check it out . it sounds pretty nos ##tal ##gic .
i won ' t have a switch but , i think that may be worth checking out .
i understand where you are coming from . can you blame her for window shopping though ?
honestly , we all do it . plus , who cares if she checks out other guys if she is coming home with you !
that ' s awesome . you must be excited . i ' ve been to can ##cu ##n but not co ##zu ##mel .
you ' re not worried about the bad boo ##ze or kidnapping ##s ?
i would hate to live by myself . i have been married 21 years and have 6 kids and 7 grand ##ki ##ds . i don ' t know what it ' s like to be alone .
yeah , my kids are almost all grown . i don ' t know what i will do when they are all gone . i guess i will just enjoy the grand ##ki ##ds and my husband . it will be different .
oh go ##sh ! that ' s terrible . i stayed in a house with a rat problem for a while , it was not fun . what ' re you going to do about them ?
woo ##oo ##w , ha ##ha . time for a game plan ! i hope you can get rid of them , you may need to call up some friends or an ex ##ter ##mina ##tor .
yes all the time ! that sounds like a nice dream . do you still have a close relationship with your family ?
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you can repair and issues you have between you guys . there ' s nothing more important than family .
oh my go ##sh that ' s terrifying ! what kind of snake was it ? and what did you do ?
that ' s awesome ! i am truly impressed with your handling of the situation .
i have 3 , do you have any
i don ' t think i could work in a day ##care . it would be overwhelming .
some people are just better at working with kids .
i like kids but i wouldn ' t want to work with them all day .
that is the worst .
lo ##l . all men do for that matter
you and me both .
wow , what a surprise !
oh why is that ?
it is indeed , learning things at young age is a boon . you got an exceptional daughter
ha ##ha ! ! you are i guess ! !
oh no . did you try to re ##tra ##ce your steps to find it ?
oh that stink ##s . did you have phone insurance at least ?
i ' m so sorry . hopefully there is something they can do for you
it ' s worth it so you don ' t have to be without a phone .
i know where this is going lo ##l
so it wasn ' t a kitten ?
what was it ?
there were some bu ##rds fighting under my car once and i thought it was cats .
that sounds like fun ! it ' s great to spend time with our children . did you have fun ?
oh yes , they can do that when they get older . my daughter is a teenager now , so i can relate !
i bet it was ! i have two kids but they ' re pretty young . i ' m looking forward to seeing them achieve the same thing .
my son is going to the fourth grade and has been doing great so far . i hope he can keep it up !
oh man , that is the worst ! all that hard work , ruined
i love eggs and cheese and would have been heart ##broken . good thing pizza was available
i have never heard of that
oh cool . i never been to any kind of motorcycle event
i bet . what grades are they in ?
are you excited for them ?
that ' s really frustrating . what band was it a t - shirt for ?
oh , i bet i could guess what kind of music they ' d play . sorry about your shirt problem , though .
i used to go fishing with my grandpa a lot as a kid , brings back awesome memories
i feel the exact same way . i haven ' t fished in years for that same reason
that ' s a good feeling
how many kids do you want ?
oh dan ##g ! did you file for classes late ?
i ' m so sorry to hear it ! were you able to take anything ?
that ' s my favorite part of facebook ! especially when i see old pic ##s of my kids .
about this time of year , there ' s a lot of ' first day of school ' pic ##s .
and in between football games and soccer games , and christmas ##es - it ' s a healthy reminder that time flies so quickly !
i know google photos has a little reminder thing ##y where it says something like , " remember this day ? "
oh that is awesome ! im sure you do ! waiting for that can really feel like forever when its only been a few minutes !
its good that you are excited ! im sure you will be a great asset for them !
ha ##ha ! i am only laughing because i know exactly what you are talking about ! that has happened to me a couple times ! . i had to use a hand towel once !
ha ! i wasn ' t thinking at the time . i was just grabbing whatever was around !
why ' s that ?
did you go with anyone ?
that ##s good ! relationships aren ' t for everyone all the time . you have to love yourself before you can love someone else right ?
yes , and you will end up meeting someone when your ##e not looking and n ot expecting it .
that ##s no good
i know that feeling ##h
that ' s good . your interview must have went really well .
well i hope you get it then .
that ##s good . its very important to ins ##till good learning and study ha ##bb ##its . something i wish i had as kid
sounds like she is ready to succeed
that is good to hear . i am glad you did not overs ##pen ##d and go into debt .
i hope you can find another job soon .
i love self gifts . what was it
that ##s pretty cool
really ? is it a good show ? i ' ve never heard of it .
i ' m the same way ! although now that i know it is scary i probably won ' t watch it !
i do sometimes too
i have seen things like that from people in my own city . it kind of messed up
that ##s pretty sweet
what kind of cake ?
that sounds about right . how old is she ?
at 13 everything is interesting to her . she may just want attention .
i just got in a few months ago , best of luck my friend !
i am in the information systems field
yes ! my husband and i bought the old school nintendo and played a couple of months back .
they are , i really enjoyed playing them . we also played donkey kong .
why is that making you sad ?
that is true , well there is a lot of time left
i love playing mario !
i haven ' t played that one , i will have to try it out .
that ' s nice of you . is it a special occasion ?
use a recipe and stick to it . if he is a good boyfriend he will appreciate your effort .
oh my word ! i wo ##uls have just died
where did it go ?
that ' s sweet ! family is so important and relationships with siblings is a very significant one in our lives . i felt the same about my sister .
we weren ' t , only 2 1 / 2 years . it was just the two of us and we were very close , she passed away several years ago .
i do , i used to play growing up .
i will have to try it out !
what field is that for ? i am sure that is a lot of stress
that makes sense , well i wish you the best of luck !
well , you can ' t do everything .
give yourself a break . your financial health is important too .
that is smart , money is tight these days
that can be tough to do , but will pay off in the long run !
everyone has bad bosses . just keep working hard and they will have to recognize your great ##ness .
then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else ?
what did you get ?
seriously ? do you like super smash bros ? it is coming out in december , i love my switch to death man , it is amazing
i have been there , i hope everything works out for you !
thank goodness , that will make you stressed .
oh that is nice ! what happened at the party ?
oh that ' s nice ! enjoy summer while it lasts . what did you go to college for ?
yeah that was awesome ! i feel like they have a less than stellar track record when it comes to fan service .
i get where you are coming from . nintendo fans are not easy to please !
i love the fair ! did you have a good time ?
that sounds like a great time !
what is your field ?
we need you . hang in there .
what are they for ?
ah okay , that is good then , i hope they are effective for you !
oh , most jobs don ' t unfortunately
that ' s very unusual . most jobs don ' t . i would talk to the managers about it ! paid lunch would be great
well , maybe the time in bed will help you relax
that must be quite di ##ssa ##point ##ing
that sounds really exciting ? what was it ?
congratulations . that ##s awesome . i hope you give him the world
i ' m sorry to hear that , growing up can be tough .
that is hard , especially being so far away from family .
that ' s wonderful . i have two daughters 10 and 13 . i wish you the best .
you ' ll do fine . as long as you love him , everything else will work out .
i haven ' t heard about the " direct " yet . what about it do you like ?
that sounds exciting ! i can ' t wait to what they come up with next !
i know that feeling . i do phone support too .
yep , but you can only help one person at a time .
why is that ?
oh , that would not have been fun ! they do not like people !
that ' s terrible .
are you going to say anything to your sur ##per ##ior ##s .
why is that ?
oh , well they probably do not need any ice cream !
ha ##ha , they can eat ice cream when they are the parents !
aw he ' s still a little guy .
cher ##ish the moment while you can !
oh no , i hate to heart that . i hope everything is okay .
something big must have happened .
oh no , did something happen to have caused it ?
i ' m sorry to hear about what happened . are you staying with your wife ?
that is bad . what are you planning to do instead ?
that is good also . hanging out with friends is the best thing to do .
that ' s great ! i must have been so cool to see that !
that ' s really great !
no way , that is the worst . did you ask your roommate why he or she ate it ?
i am sorry to hear that !
is that the first day ?
that ' s nice . mine started a couple of weeks ago .
that ' s a good thing . it can sometimes be overwhelming though
i know what you mean . we are getting club schedules together for my teen
you are very fortunate . have you decided on a name yet ?
you will know when the time is right . i am adopted myself , so i have a special place in my heart for new parents .
that sounds fun !
did you get a lot of gifts too ?
children are angels !
yes , that happens every ##time !
those games are usually so fun .
i will do that .
cong ##rat ##s , how fast did it go by ?
u ##gh i was hoping that is not the case , i would want my kid to be young forever
i had to work when i turned 21 . that must have been awesome
i went to the casino after and won 250 dollars but i was by myself lo ##l
how do you feel about that ?
sorry to hear that , i hope you get chances to visit !
i enjoy football , but i mainly enjoy that when football happens , fall comes .
what do you do for work ?
i am so thankful that i am able to stay home with my child .
it really is !
why is that ?
i am glad it did not make you depressed !
me too .
i am sorry to hear that , i have been there before .
i think so , that ' s the giant shark movie , right ?
i ' ve never been much for sea stuff for some reason .
no , it ' s just not my thing . i like sci fi and horror . . . just not sea stuff
i know exactly what you mean
i hate that too . especially when you are paying and they are right behind you . . . like , why ?
does he at least work hard for it ?
hopefully he has worked hard for it . i ' m sorry you have to deal with that
i can imagine .
you have a lot of hard work ahead .
that ' s awesome . what kind of car .
that is a nice car !
i am so sorry to hear that . i am glad you found people to count on .
i am happy for you
me neither , how do you feel about it ?
me too , best of luck !
that ' s really sweet . is there any member of your family you are particularly close with ?
siblings can be our closest con ##fi ##dant ##s , and in a lot of cases , lifelong friends .
do you like being home alone much ?
yeah i can relate to that , alone time is sometimes very relaxing
i bet . that is a special moment
what did you name him ?
that ' s so cute . i have a son named ethan
that sounds fun , did she have a good time ?
that is even better ! school shopping can be so expensive .
uh oh , are you ready for the " terrible 2 ' s " ?
he will be into everything . i know what you mean about looking back . kids grow so fast .
oh no , i am so sorry ! i hope you find him .
i ' m sure he will return !
that ' s cool .
i was told that recently . my il ##fe revolves around my kids
i know exactly w ##ha ##at you ' re saying
well that ' s fun ! did he do a good job ?
cool i ' m glad it was a success . i hope it reminded you of good times !
did you like that ? i find re ##using dresses very comb ##ini ##ent
that is really nice , i still have my wedding dress
that ' s so nice !
hey children are a mir ##icle .
that ' s nice . what sort of work do you do ?
great , how about a loan ? just kidding .
wow , it sounds like a very exotic holiday
ok , but at least you got to do something you have always wanted right ? visit gulf shores
i hate how it ##chy you get after being bitten .
the bites take forever to go away , too !
it ' s a difficult fact of life
i think that ' s normal ! eventually you will adjust
can ' t you just get another one ?
maybe you can just get another job .
oh no , you should probably deal with the consequences
how do you feel about that ?
don ' t worry too much about it , worrying can actually make you pre ##form worse . you can always re ##take the test !
you got it !
wow , then you know how it feels . i hope you do great .
i bet you won ' t have anything to worry about . we will both excel .
oh no ! i ' ve never seen that movie , but it sounds like it was very ho ##rri ##fying ! have you watched it as an adult ?
well , at least you were able to conquer your fear !
wow , that is sl ##ea ##zy , what did you do ?
i do not know , how did you discover that was the case ?
that is sad i wish you and your family the best of wishes
that is normal when you lose someone , but time heal ##s everything
that is gross , what kind of food ?
that is nasty , you have to kill that habit !
that ' s great , we all deserve to feel peace and happiness with how our lives are going .
you ' re a kind person to wish that .
how did it go ?
oh no ! i hope you didn ' t feel too humiliated .
that something which you should be proud of .
i hate interest too . it is always to pay cash .
if you were given the project , it ' s probably because someone thinks you can do it !
it ' s a very good feeling when someone has faith in you ! good luck with your project !
you should get the same sneakers then .
just save up and eventually , you will be able to get them .
were you scared ? hope it wasn ' t a mean dog .
good idea . glad you got away safely .
oh , good luck ! are you nervous for the job interview ?
it ' s so great to be prepared ! i ' m sure the interview ##ers will be impressed !
sounds like you ' re ready to ride out the storm . are you afraid ?
true . i bet it was a mad house at the supermarket today .
that is so nerve rack ##ing . i ' m sure you will do great .
do you usually do good in math ? it is my favorite subject and always came so easy for me .
yeah , that can be a tough time . pretty soon he ' ll be off to college !
well , i am sure he will meet a bunch of jolly good fellows while he ' s still in high school . you just got to keep on top of him with his grades and he will be fine .
hey , i ' m looking forward to it too ! can ' t wait to crush my co - workers .
i play on the ps ##4 . it ' s the only way to play madden .
what book you reading ?
lo ##l i feel you , i too am lacking in that department
that is too bad . how did they get hurt ?
ou ##ch . i hope he didn ' t lose any teeth .
why did you think he was after you ?
although you might have really been scared your story sound kind of funny !
oh , lucky you ! what ' s his or her name ?
that ' s so wonderful . my boyfriend has a cat named smoke ( i call him sm ##ok ) that i love soo ##o much . good luck !
yeah , that feature is pretty ni ##ft ##y . makes it so you don ' t have to keep hard ##co ##py photo albums anymore !
i feel you man . seeing pictures of my baby son tears me right up .
that ' s really nice of her ! was there a special occasion or anything ?
dan ##g , kind of reminds me i should probably do something nice for my wife . . .
that ' s unfortunate . what type of exam do you have ?
how ironic . unable to study finances because you ' re at work making your own .
oh no , what ' s up ?
the anticipation must be crazy .
nice ! what kind of cake was it ?
those cakes are really good ! i believe they are made of dried milk .
was it planned ?
that ' s terrible . did they give you a reason ?
wow , what a lucky day for you !
pizza is my absolute favorite , i could eat it for the rest of my life .
aw looks isn ' t everything .
wow . i ' ve gotta see this guy then .
how un ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##al of your professor to say that ! what was your project over ?
silver lining : she said she didn ' t want to fail you , so at least you passed your project .
at ##lea ##st you gave something it ' s the thought that counts right .
as long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesn ' t matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can don ' t be down .
oh man , i bet you didn ' t sleep for weeks !
no , it wasn ' t . i bet you learned your lesson not to steal pretty quickly .
that ' s so cool ! what did you think about that ?
very interesting . maybe i should look into that to connect to my great grandmother .
how did you cheat ?
hopefully , you pass at least .
oh dan ##g . did anyone come eventually ?
well , at least you weren ' t left there for all eternity .
re ##mini ##sc ##ing on memories how old was you are ya ' ll still together ?
so young lo ##l well at least it ' s a good memory and the good weather makes you happy and think about it .
they usually are . who ' s wedding did you go to ?
of course ! i ' m sure he appreciated you being there !
i hate it when that happens . you should get a lock for the fridge .
some people just have no consideration . you deserve to eat your left ##over chinese .
i bet your excited , wish i was you
good for you , send me a post card , enjoy
well that ' s nice of you . did he give you anything in return ?
wow . i wonder how they even saw that the grass needed to be cut living in darkness .
well , at least he / she feels better now ? sorry about your shoes .
wow . i didn ' t know shoes could cost that much !
wow , that ' s quite the career leap ! what made you do it ?

aw , i ' m sorry . losing a pet is very hard . i recently lost a cat . it hurts .
thank you . yes , even though it ' s been a month since we said goodbye , i still look for him around the house .
oh wow ! are you afraid of heights at all ?
that ' s great ! maybe i should conquer my fear of heights that way , too !
wow , that ' s incredible ! good for him .
i think so too , he knows what it ' s like to be down and out and to work hard for his own success .
i ' m sorry to hear about that . what are the risks if you were to go through with it ?
that is definitely risky . is the alternative of staying sick better ?
that ' s awesome ! math is pretty tough .
glad all that studying worked out !
aw , i am sorry to hear that . are things better now between the two of you ?
distance is sometimes the best healer . glad to hear things are patch ##ed up .
oh no : ( did you take him to the vet ? what kind of dog is it ?
those are such smart dogs ! i hope it ' s nothing
that can be scary ! do you feel prepared ?
you ' ll be okay ! use the age old public speaking advice , picture everyone in their underwear ! good luck !
i hope it turns out well !
it must be such a relief . i ' m happy for ya .

i am sure she will like it as long as you followed the recipe .
that ' s awesome ! good luck to ya .

dan ##g , that sucks . do you have an insurance policy on it ?
nice . at least you won ' t lose any money .
that ' s adorable ! what was the word ?
oh my . that is quite a unique first word !
yeah , it can be tough . especially if you ' re in a heated argument .
i know right ? ! ? sometimes it ' s just best to be quiet , even though you know you are right , to help things get better .
i know how you feel ! i don ' t have carpet in my living room for that reason - sometimes they have accidents . i hate po ##o accidents especially !
oh yes , best to have her not alone ever during this time .
was it yours or the bank ' s fault ?
if it was the bank ' s mistake , even if you didn ' t have enough money , they ' re responsible for fixing it .
that ' s perfection . i rescue animals as well . and have many more cats then that lo ##l . it is very needed to help cats
me too ! it ' s very hard sometimes , like running an orphanage but it is reward ##ing as well !
how old is it ? did you guys play on it a lot together ?
that ' s cool , i don ' t know the first thing about building my own pc .
did he / she say something you may disagree with ?
that sounds un ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##al . i thought they were supposed to sound neutral .
i didn ' t know such a thing existed ! what store ?
oh ! that ' s a nice program . well getting any amount of groceries for free is nice , but yes too bad it wasn ' t a supermarket sweep
i ' m sorry to hear that . is something wrong ?
little things build up sometimes . i hope you feel better as well .
was it domino ' s pizza ?
because i love domino ' s so that ' s the only pizza i think of !
oh who was there ? !
oh sweet . how ' s the new phone ?
that would really ann ##oy me ! did you end up taking any action against them ? i know some companies will tow a vehicle that does that .
man , the nerve on some people . i would never take somebody ' s spot if they have a sign up for it !
what a g ##lu ##tton . did he happen to have a mountain of crab legs ?
man , i feel bad for his stomach . it ' s probably as worn out and b ##lo ##ated as my great grand ##dad .
50 ? that might be a world record or something . how did you find out ?
i guess he learned his lesson . only eat 25 . ha ha .
i agree , i loved that show so much when i was little .
i agree , what ' s your favorite ?
mental illness is very tough to deal with it by themselves .
who are the care ##gi ##vers ? his / her parents ? or children ?
are you in trouble ?
well they can be , but make sure you buy it next time . ram ##en is super cheap : )
that must have been very nos ##tal ##gic
kids grow up so fast . gotta cher ##ish every moment sometimes .
that is tough . how is she doing ?
that is terrible . has she cut off all contact with them ?
how ' d it go ?
that sucks . and you guys studied the same amount ?
how do you feel ?
that ' s great ! hopefully , the meeting goes well .
pet alligator ! why do you have him as a pet , is he a rescue ?
well , i ' m not sure about that or how are you typing ? !
oh yeah ? what did your dog do ?
aw ##w ##w ##w ##w , that ' s so cool . i remember when my dog was going through all that over a year ago . they learn so fast .
nice ! what is he working on ?
i ' m sure he won ' t . sounds like he ' s a hard worker .
oh wow . i wonder what that kind of bite feels like . did it hurt ?
right , have to train them not to i suppose , if at all possible .
that is good . when do you have the exam ?
good luck .
dan ##g . why don ' t you just get your own ?
that ' s reasonable . just make sure you get your own when you have the funds available .
that sounds like a lot of fun . what do you do now ?
oh so sorry to hear that . well maybe you can round them up for something .
i completely agree ! i am all about keeping the earth clean , recycling , and low waste living . they should get bigger fines !
i ' m right with you . oh , cigarette butt ##s gross me out , not to mention second hand smoke which has been found to cause cancer too .
oh god . does that store have san ##iti ##zing wipe ##s ?
some people just aren ' t consider ##ate of others like that .
do you normally do make ##overs ?
wow that would be so cool ! i don ' t do makeup good on others . did you do anything with her hair ?
that ' s wonderful . what was it ?
that ' s so cute !
nice ! is she happy about it ?
that ' s too bad . maybe she can come with you ?
that sounds about right for the bus station , unfortunately . how did everyone react when they saw it ?
wow . i hope you don ' t ever have to see anything like that again !
ha ##ha , i wouldn ' t worry about it . there is much worse things you can do . unless you ' re doing something you shouldn ' t be doing online !
yeah , well maybe you can offer to pay for half of it instead ?
that ' s terrible ! did you say anything about it ?
yeah , i would be too . hopefully they ' ll invite you in the future .
oh no , is it a young dog or an older one ?
right , pup ##pies are like that . it took mine a year and a half before they weren ' t having any more accidents like that .
it ' s really nice that you feel that way , even though you wanted it . think you ' ll get it next time ?
well , it certainly sounds like you deserve it . you sound like a good person .
that ' s awesome . debt really is an awful thing .
glad all that hard work paid off for ya . i as ##pire to get there someday myself .
oh wow , that ' s great . what unit are you in now and what made you want to change ?
that ' s awesome . are you a nurse ? i used to work in the nic ##u . it was a wonderful job . good luck with your new position .
wow ! that is pretty amazing im ##o . . unless she isn ' t good with kids . . my first almost killed me . . and i am terrified to do it again . .
aw well , as long as she is a good mom , more power too her : ) children are great fun .
oh no . what ' s going on ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . are you thinking about changing your diet and exercise routine ?
did you at least study ?
ok
nice . how long did that take you to learn ?
that ' s really great . you should go join the circus .
must ' ve been a good bu ##rp .
must ' ve gave them a good chuckle . don ' t worry . they ' ll get over it .
oh man . was she mad ?
dan ##g . well , i am sure you won ' t make that mistake in the future !
i bet . i love fast food soo ##oo much . what did you have ?
it really does . i feel your pain on the no wheat policy . i used to eat fast food all of the time and now i am a no wheat no oil vega ##n , so no fast food .
i ' m not celia ##c , but i just eat whole food plant based . it has been hard for me because i also hate vegetables ( not good for a vega ##n ) but i drink a lot of fresh vegetable juice ##s and whole food smooth ##ies to get the nutrients in . i feel so much better now , though , that i can ' t go back . check out the happy pear on youtube , they have great vega ##n recipes .
i am very sorry to hear all of that , it is a little more expensive , but i found i feel so much better i can actually work more o make up the difference . check out dr . michael greg ##er , too if you haven ' t he is a great resource as well .
oh no ! ! when did this happen ?
oh , i feel you ! i used to be a food addict as well when i was younger . it is a hard habit to break ! it ' s amazing how far you have come though ! so many don ' t realize that fresh real food make a difference and you feel so good when you get real nutrition !
that ' s too bad ! do you know if you can buy a new one before the show ?
ye ##a , maybe you can find an alternative . i lost a few shirts over the years before too , it ' s no fun .
i wouldn ' t be able to keep a surprise like that !
sounds like you ' re ready to go !
wow , that ' s quite the shift ! did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you ?
best of luck to you , i hope everything works out great in the end !
was the dog upset about something or was he / she just telling you whose boss ?
she probably bad mouthed you while out there .
that ' s too bad . maybe she will find a new one soon .
that ' s always a plus . i am sure that will make the search less stress ##ful .
is the dog pot ##ty trained ?
that ' s why i don ' t have carpet ##ing .
that ' s really nice ! did you guys rec ##onne ##ct ?
it ' s always great to rec ##onne ##ct to old friends .
fear when you are a child can be so gripping . what were you afraid of ?
that is really terrifying .
that is really mean . why does she do it ?
i would too if my wife did that . it ' s alright , man .
that ' s unfortunate ! what style food did your favorite restaurant serve ?
dim sum , huh ? i haven ' t heard of that before . what exactly is that ?
where did you take her ?
what did she eat on your date ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . are you saving more ?
ye ##a . you should definitely hold off on buying a new car for now .
oh my god ! ! she must have been raised in a barn !
like a bathroom maybe ! some people really just don ##t understand manners .
ha ##ha , that ' s funny you mention that . i seen the same thing happen to a girl when i was at the grocery story one time .
yeah , it must be a pretty embarrassing moment . although it ' s an honest mistake .
you have one as a pet ?
that ' s great , losing a pet would have been awful .
yeah , i sometimes do that as well . but , as long as the bills are getting paid , i guess you can ' t complain .
true . but , you can ' t help stupid people from getting high paying jobs . i am a prime example .
is the first time that he ran away ?
then it is a little bit scary . did you try to find him ?
that sounds awesome ! have you guys been friends long ?
that ' s pretty cool . you guys must have a good relationship .
how ' d it go ?
i wish you luck anyway !
that ' s disgusting ! why are cats so rude ?
i hope that that was the last time you have to clean up any mess ##es ! sending my prayers !
really ?
i would like to come there and see it , how are you doing it ?
i haven ' t actually . have you ?
i ' ve heard good things about the navy and also how tough it is .
that ' s awesome ! good luck on your finals !
don ' t forget to get some rest though .
nice ! what kind of food do they serve ?
that sounds incredibly ta ##sty . i think i will have to go there .
that ' s so kind of you !
aw i ' m so happy for it . do you miss it ?
wow , that ' s pretty nice of her . i wish my girlfriend would cook for me !
yes she certainly does ! i guess she makes up for it in other ways !
that ' s awesome ! was it your birthday ?
they sound great ! happy birthday to you !
i think that ' s normal . what were you afraid of ?
must ' ve been really terrifying . what did your parents do ?
that is so sad . what happened to her mom ?
that is really said . i hope that she gets a new mom some day .
i am sure you did fine . did you study hard ?
it will be fine ! you ' ll be staring at an a before you know it !
oh my that does sound really relaxing . the weather was nice ?
that ' s great . i ' m glad you got to feel that feeling .
that is no fun ! i have been feeling lonely lately too , where are your fr ##ined ##s ?
that is lame ! what was their excuse ?
oh no ! does she have any applications outstanding ?
true . sometimes you have to lower your standards to something more realistic .
that ' s kinda sad . is he studying or something ?
yeah , pushing herself could end up to her having a horrible life .
i would ' ve been angry .
that ' s funny and also kind of a waste of pizza .
they sound very helpful and caring ! would you take their classes again ?
awesome ! that makes me glad that there are still teachers and professors that truly care !
why aren ' t you looking forward to it ?
i hope it turns out well whatever it is .
she is a saint !
i don ' t know how anyone could turn an abused child away . . it ' s not easy but they need help .
whoa that ' s terrible . did the police catch the robber ?
yes i would be too . i hope you catch them and i hope he didn ' t loose too much stuff .
that ##s a strong relationship , im happy to hear people like you still exist in this world
that ##s disgusting , then why even be in a relationship waist ##ing someone ##s time
nice ! was it ta ##sty ?
i love having that feeling . especially after eating a healthy snack !
oh lord , i bet ! do you start early and what is it ?
that ' s comical . most of us don ' t reach 90 .
that happened to someone else today too ! that is a bum ##mer but is she just a puppy ?
that is good . you are better then me . . i rescue but i would hate having that on something new .
that ' s kinda creepy . what do you think happened to him ?
hmm ##mm . . . maybe he just went on vacation ?
wow . where ya going ?
i don ' t think the polar bears are gonna let you near their coke , man .
that ' s really neat . what kind of dance was it ?
wow , sounds pretty impressive !
oh no . what happened ?
how long ago was this ?
where did they go
oh . . do they visit often ?
your car door ?
was it parked at home ? that sucks
was it tax free weekend ?
ah . . that sounds like a smart move .
wow really ? that ' s interesting . and yet he still teaches ?
i guess he really does do it for the passion of teaching then .
that ' s good to hear . what ' s going on ?
it ' s good to reunite with them again , hu ?
that ' s pretty awesome . do you usually run marathon ##s ?
glad your hard work paid off . was this marathon for a good cause ?
that ' s a really good idea , smart thinking !
well hopefully nothing bad will happen and you won ' t need to use it .
oh no , do you know what caused it ?
oh god . i ' m guessing they didn ' t take responsibility ?
oh wow . . do you think they can handle it ?
that ##s a good idea then if she can manage it
sorry to hear that ! losing pets is tough , it ' s essentially losing a family member .
i hope you find the peace that you deserve and know your pet loved you !
wow ! that is awesome !
will he be in school this year ?
that is nice . how old is she ?
that is awesome .
oh , pity . speak with them daily .
i ' m away from my family for the past 10 years .
that ' s good to hear . have they been there for you in the past ?
that ' s so kind of them . i ' m glad you ' re repay ##ing their kindness .
were you able to make it up ?
oh good luck !
what . are they still viable ?
will you get a ref ##und ?
i hope you did a really great job .
that ' s all you can do at this point
that was so nice of her ! what kind of food ?
wow , that ' s impressive . a very exotic dish for sure !
tennis ? i am terrible at that game
well if you were playing me you would definitely win
that sounds like fun . do you not go out with them anymore ?
hey being single isn ' t that bad ! you ' ll find your soul ##mate one day when the time is right .
i would feel the exact same way , how come it did not work ?
that is a little ag ##gra ##vating , i would be pissed too
it is a great time of the year
i agree .
o ##oh , cool , what are you gonna do while they ' re away ?
nice , sounds like a relaxing weekend .
sorry to hear that . what were you upset about ?
a c is not too bad . i know how you feel , i hold myself to a very high standard as well . it could have been much worse though !
oh no that ' s so dangerous . are you okay ?
yes , i would be too . that was so ir ##res ##pon ##sible of them !
that ' s very nice of you . i hope you guys have a great time !
i ' m sure it will go well ! what are you cooking ?
sorry to hear that . sounds like sleep for you might not be in the cards tonight ?
i ' m hoping for a miracle for you so that you can get a little bit of shut eye !
that is nice . do you take them frequently ?
that is a good surprised .
oh no ! i hate to hear that ! have you found another place yet ?
well i think you ' ll be able to sell it for a good price .
its funny what one saves , i saved a mickey mouse that was given to me while i was in the hospital things like 20 years old lo ##l
good times , you got to hold on to the memories
that ' s why they are being replaced by machines lo ##l
i thought i had seen every episode of lock down . i haven ' t seen that lo ##l
oh no ! i hope she ' s ok . have you taken her to the vet ?
i hope she does too . maybe spend extra time loving on her tonight she she ' ll feel better .
i hope so too . stay inside just in case .
i hate lightning . it makes me jump every time .
what are you going to do ?
won ' t you visit ? 4
oh man , that always leads to trouble for me lo ##l
they probably changed their crust or something , they always do that mess .
i know that feeling
i know right . i was never truly explained the world of " bills "
me too , but i had a long day at work and right now im just relaxing in the cold air for a little bit longer
that sounds like a great plan honestly
that ' s wonderful . it always feels good to pay off debt i think .
yes , you must be very proud for accomplish ##ing that .
what ##s goin on ?
that should be fun . i have to work this weekend . i need to hang with friends before i go crazy
bed ##time ##s can be really hard for the kids and the adults too . lo ##l
oh no , i have to take her side now . summer ' s are made to break the rules .
6
the place didn ' t fall apart did it ?
well , that has never happened to me . i never think about work when i ' m not there lo ##l
yeah that ##s annoying , its happened to me before
i used rope from the warehouse once as a belt
that ' s how it works , for most of us lo ##l
if only they had told us sooner .
did you usually visit them ?
that ' s cool ! are you gonna go all out with decorations and things ?
are you nervous ? i ' m sure they ' re gonna love you .
then throw the whole dude away and get you a new one ! you deserve the best !
that is a real bum ##mer . i hope you got a security deposit . they won ' t be getting that back .
make sure to leave feedback on their profile . hopefully they can ' t get any more rental ##s .
i am sure nothing will happen to you .
i understand . sometime , i become also super ##sti ##tious .
did you flip out ?
that ' s true . were the questions even important ?
from you drinking it or someone taking it ?
i think it ' s time to hide your drinks from them . it works . that is what my mom did when i was a kid .
are you concerned about ao ##met ##hing ?
think positively . stress ##ing yourself out can definitely cause a problem
that ' s always fun , the kids always love it so much
probably so but they ' ll remember it in the future and have fond memories .
oh no ! are you okay ?
it ' s okay , everyone makes mistakes sometimes . i hope the other driver is okay .
oh no , about what ?
oh no , i ' ve been there done that too many times .
oh no
you won ' t believe how many times that has happened to me
that is really fun to do , wah ##t did you buy ?
i really like going once a month to buy something i really want helps with my anxiety
oh no ! i can only imagine how that would have felt ! how old was it ?
aw ##w that ' s so sad ! but it ' s good to know she will be remembered
ya ##y ! i am excited for you , have you known her long ?
ha ##ha i see i see , that ##s good ! i hope it goes well and you fall in love
don ##t we all : )
seems one would know where that kept such precious things
i never got into the pokemon cr ##az ##e
well that will be fun for you guys !
oh no , i hate to hear that . did he have a good reason ?
i have been thinking about it too . its hard out here
i know right . especially for women .
awe i love weddings ! were they having a big wedding or a small one ?
you will when the time is right and it ' ll be beautiful .
i love it when i something takes you back to yesterday . it ' s just so nos ##tal ##gic and that can be a great feeling .
so true . whenever it happens i just close my eyes and embrace it .
well that was really nice of you to do . you sound like a great neighbor .
i ' m sure she really appreciated it . i know i would .
what song was it by chance ?
that does sound terrible
i don ' t know if i should laugh or cry or both on the one lo ##l
i ' m sorry , i didn ' t mean to be rude . hopefully his demise showed someone out there that drinking is bad and made them change their life .
alright ! is that a big money promotion for them ?
that ##s great ! did ya ##ll go out and celebrate ?
did you cry ?
well it looks like you survived !
do you mean that literally or are you just ready to move ?
don ' t give up . i know it can be disco ##ura ##ging when your trying so hard . but it will happen .
how did it go ?
im not sure if that ' s good or bad .
i am so afraid of coaster ##s .
that is very unlikely . that ##s what they say .
would you believe i have never seen one episode of that show ? how sad that it ' s ending before i even got to watch it !
well don ' t tell me what happens , i might just go watch it all now lo ##l
stuff like that makes me wonder if they had been talking to each other the whole time
i feel you , but you will find someone better and he down ##grade ##d lo ##l
i ' ve never seen that but i love a good tear jerk ##er !
i ' ll have to check it out this weekend . anything about the holocaust makes me cry .
that ' s a smart move ! good thinking !
that ' s so nice of you to help them out ! i ' m sure they ' re really thankful .
where are their parents ?
call the police . i would .
well . hope you score high .
yeah , it is !
oh really ? and why is that ?
wow , any reason for that ?
i hate that feeling . are you still feeling that way now ?
well i ' m glad you found your friends , that ' s a terrible way to feel . i ' ve been there before .
that was a crap ##py thing to do . better get a handle on it now or it could become a big problem .
they probably deserve it but you know the old saying two wrong ##s don ' t make a right .
oh no . is that a good thing ?
my daughter will be 14 this year . you just made me feel old lo ##l
oh man , honey bun ##s are the best snack cake ever !
i ' m the same way . i ' ll eat them in the car on the way home sometimes lo ##l
wow , nice ! congratulations that . you must have worked hard .
i hope it was all worth it for this moment . good job !
that ' s sad , are you throwing them a going away party ?
well i ' m sure they ' ll like that and i bet they ' re gonna miss you too .
who chose the place ?
cool . i love italian . real italian .
that ' s because you worked hard and never gave up ! i ' m proud of you !
one day you ' ll be able to . just keep your head up !
someone was recording him from the shadows
i wish i could do one
they make me sad too . i wish i could heal all those sick kids .
it makes me feel better knowing that they get such great care at st jude ' s and the parents never get a bill though .
you must have been terrified . did you see it happen ?
that is so awful . was he a the victim of a crime or was it some type of accident ?
i would have been so scared . what did you do ?
did you ever find out who he was ?
oh ok , i hope you are enjoying it . why only one receiver ?
well that was a good choice then ! it will save you some money too i ' m sure
it ' s about time then . maybe now you will be able to get the back payments too .
it ' s hard to depend on it . don ' t figure it into your billing . that way if he doesn ' t pay it can ' t hurt you .
i could never do that .
you couldn ; t stay at work until the next day . my job requires security to walk females out when its late .
wow , you didn ##t want to be around them that bad ?
lo ##lo ##l that ##s actually hilarious , i guess that ##s why its ex now lo ##l
uh . maybe its not something that important
oh . i get it . that ##s good then
those are so much fun . family or school ?
that will be great . take lots of pictures , you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make .

that was sweet . did you eat together ?
she sounds like a keeper
how do you feel about that ? are you ready ?
oh i see . speeches always make me a bit nervous too . . . but once you start , it gets less wo ##rri ##some i think .

i know right ! they keep going up in my area its crazy !
that would be amazing ! you could skip al ##ot of traffic
i keep all my photos online .
i can not even imagine how that would be .
good for him . what sport do they play and was it any of that state level competitions ?
seems promising . what position does he play ?
wow , i would be quite upset , at ##lea ##st let me know before you do that !
wow , that ##s unbelievable . did you let her know it upset you ?
oh man that ' s actually hilarious i hope he was a baby . . . ?

oh my god , are you doing okay ? what ha ##pen ##ed ?
oh my god . i hate when people are so careless .
that would have to stop immediately or that shovel might be used for something else .
if he won ' t stop you may need to take a picture of him doing it and then contact the authorities .
yes , life moves so fast its truly hard to believe some times .
i couldn ' t agree more , sometimes it feels like i was a little kid just yesterday .
i know what you mean , i don ' t even bother at this point .
exactly the same for me . don ' t let it bother you too much .
awe that is sweet , was it a special occasion ?
that is good ! just a reminder that you have a father that loves you .
yes ! that is the worst , i feel like my time is being wasted .
i say just keep putting yourself out there , can ##t give up .
what was the big day then ?
oh cool , i hope it goes well !
that ##s pretty cool
wow that ##s crazy
i would say that is one of life simple joy ##s , not a care in the world .
i try to do that as often as i possibly can .
that is not cool , what where you guys planning to do
if he had other things to do it is ok , but i hate when people cancel just bea ##cus ##e they are sleeping ha ##ha
i have no friend at all .
maybe try a bar with food !
what did you do with the money ?
what was it ? was it clothing ?
yes ! life is a blessing , and we need to make the most of every day .
god is good to people . he is always there for you .
i would have thrown up !
i would have left the entire house !
did you take any medicine ?
they want you to take their medicines ?
maybe try and watch tv or play games .
maybe go outside and try and eat dirt .
i guess because they are healthy and don ' t taste that bad .
really ? must be some bad peas .
maybe they found a lover to share life with .
that changes everyone ' s life .
it ' s a good feeling when you are successful after you have worked so hard .
the way you felt should be motivation to keep up the good work .
oh really i bet i would be too
ye ##a i know what you mean
that is the most beautiful thing iv ##e ever heard
that is a great plan !
i would cry if anyone i know died .
that actually sounds super sad .
that must of been scary .

that ##s a good plan . did the snow and ice come ?
like the boy scouts - always be prepared .
there is not enough money to get me to do that . my sister likes those kind of shows and i watch with her sometimes .
om ##g ! were you grossed out ?
oh that ' s terrible . was he busy with something else ?
ah i see . must have slipped his mind while he was hard at work .
do you know who did it ?
did you call the police ?

what do you write with it ? do you write a letter or a book or a shopping list ?
why is that ?
i am not american so i am only vaguely aware of them . they are an american new channel is that right ?
what a lovely aunt . you must be her favorite nephew or niece
maybe she tried to bring some warm strings in relationship with you
oh no . it happened to me recently . but , i take the ##4 view that things like that happen for a good reason and you ' ll end up in a better position down the line .
i am in exactly the same boat . i ' m still searching for a new job . it ' s tough . but stay positive - it might not happen !

make sure you dress nicely and bring a positive attitude .
yeah no problem . make sure to do a mock interview with a friend or family member to practice what you will say .
is this your first job ?
what ' s wrong with the job you have now since you have been there for 21 years ? must not be too bad .
what were you expecting
ha ##ha ##h . . . that ##s too funny

wow ! 17 cat ##ago ##ries ! ! that ##is a lot !
when is it ?
how old is he then - 3 ?

you should not tolerate that discrimination . i think you should complain to hr .

maybe the baby is feeling you : ) and knows that you two are related
hm delicious . do you feel proud of yourself ? !
good work . make some for me too !
oh my go ##sh ! really ? that ' s terrible .
what did the manager say ?
how did it come out ?

scary . did you investigate ?
ph ##ew ! that ' s a relief !
hm that sounds suspicious . where do you think it went ?
do you feel afraid that there might be a ghost in the house ?
nice ! well done . what is the occasion ?
does she know you are going to be better groom ##ed though ? maybe she liked that sha ##gg ##iness !
that must be so annoying . you should ask for a pay raise .
i see , time to switch companies !
oh no . were you alright ?
i know . maybe get a cab next time !
i guess that ##s because he ' s in a higher position of senior ##ity ?
that is ag ##gra ##vating . you should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work !
amazing . was there any scares ?
that ' s cool . you live in te ##h future now .
that ' s a nice thought . your wife i take it ?
i wish i could fi ##d ##n someone like that
that ' s great , what ' s in the package ?
oh , i guess you got a new boy ##fi ##e . chocolate ##s are most often used to show love
they are really cool looking animals !
are they friendly or al ##oof ?
really ? no - one ? why not ?
i understand that . did you send out invites ?
oh sorry to hear that . how come ?
i am sure he / she understood you were just nervous . you should make it up to them .
i would have also . we always want to give our kids the best
yes , unfortunately it happens
how did that happen
ah well that would be a good reason then
nice , do you feel nervous about it ?
so you must have prepared well for it . i hope you get the job !
amazing . is that even legal though ?
that ' s cool . were you scared ?
yeah - do you think it went well then ?
good . i hope you do . when will you find out ?
oh that ##s a good friend
that ##s cool
why his pay was so big ?
then clarify this with any senior
what happen ##d after that ?
wow . for some candy ? harsh
you must be feeling kinda lonely . have you tried joining any meet ##up groups ?
good idea . check to see if there any groups on facebook of your interest .
oh wow that ' s kind of gross
i don ' t know if i could even eat a squid if it was fully cooked
that ##s a great father !
you ' re the favorite
oh my , do you know where the dent came from ?
sorry to hear that . i hate when people do that and not even leave a note owning up .
i can ' t answer that ! you seem lonely .
i hope not . try to have an enjoyable life regardless

ok
why did you sell them ?
scary ! did you figure out what it was ?
wow i ' m glad it wasn ' t something scary lo ##l
do you have a new job ?
wow . big step .
ha ##ha i ' ve done that . she was probably holding in a far ##t , too .
everyone far ##ts , man . it ' s ok .
that ' s crap ! do you know what caused it ?
sc ##umb ##ag . will it be expensive to fix ?
what happened
im sure it wasn ##t as bad as you imagined it in your head unless other people watching the movie told you to hush
why is that ?
i know how you feel . you don ' t have to let go of them because the value you place on them can be carried forward for generations and that will make them price ##less
that is good , so you must have prepared well for it .
i hope it goes well for you . hard work tends to pay off !
i didn ' t know they still toured . i saw ko ##rn years ago .
me too
expecting something special ?
that is always a great day ! ! !
i would have been too . how did it happen ?
that has happened to me before . so ag ##gra ##vating !
what ##tt ##tt ##tt . . . . . . . why did he do that
im sorry to hear that . . . hopefully he gets help to deal with issues
really ? in what way ?
nice . i suppose you get what you pay for .
don ' t think about it , what is done is done , just anti ##ci ##pate that they will call you back , the universe have it ' s way of helping if we believe
yes that ' s the spirit : )
it
it is always nice to have someone by your side when you need it
really ? why the delay ?
so sorry about that
i would have totally screamed ! were you alone ? what did you do ?
i bet it did . i ' m glad you were able to figure out what it was and hopefully you got some sleep afterwards .
who was there ?
so you just went back to sleep /
what did he do ?
that ' s too bad , did you at least find your dog ?
why not ? what did she do ?
oh my , have you found her or is she lost ?
really ? cong ##rat ##s
that ' s a good one
that sounds like a plan ! who said that , might i ask ?
words of wisdom from him . will you follow his advice ?
do you think you might get it ?
than i think you have little to worry about .
how did it go than ?
of course it was , but next time you ' ll handle it better .
ha ! do you feel guilty nor or what ? !
exactly ! but its okay to cheat a little every now and then !
oh no ! what happened after ?
wow i ' m sorry you went through that . not your fault , it happens
because nobody taught them how to live right .
government ? no way , it is interested in quite the opposite my friend .
that is really good of you . hopefully he doesn ##t decide to stay at your house forever !
nice , i wish i had a friend like that !
did you just start the job ?
i would also feel lonely
man that would have scared me too , was it an actual intruder ?
that is too funny but i have done things like that before as well
did your younger brother let it out or something like that ?
yes , this things happen , but as long as you find your dog after , it ' s alright .
why ?
cool
ou ##ch , i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are ok ?
what happened ?
well , i think you should get a new one
you can ask your best friends if they have a spare before spending money on a new one though
that ' s great ! it ' s good to be supportive of your partner
she sounds like a great person
oh wow , are you paying for her classes ?
i have 2 daughters myself and hope that they get scholarships
and did you ?
sorry to hear that . unfortunately lottery winning is a very small probability .
sometimes you need to go against the grain .
ah ye ##a . . well that ##s a good reason
wow . i have always wanted one myself ? what model ?
what color ?
oh goodness , what was it ?
oh , that is so annoying .
well , just stop here , and all should be ok .
try to promise yourself you ' ll never do that , it should help .
oh no , what happened to your dog ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that , i hope you find it .
w ##ht did you do
ye ##a i can see that
did an unexpected expense come up ?
oh , that is un ##fort ##una ##ta ##e
i am so deeply sorry ! how are you holding up ?
hang in there . . . . and remember it ' s okay to express your feelings
that ' s great , good for you for taking charge of the situation
i think it ' s so important to not let things like that bother us , i ' m really pleased for you .
good job ! you must feel so proud of yourself !
you should go out for dinner and celebrate !
i agree , are you sure you ' re buying the right groceries ?
why is that ? may i ask .
why is that ?
i know how you feel , you don ' t have to sell it buddy
special package coming today ?
wow that ' s awesome ! i am the same way . as soon as i hit " complete order " , i am counting down the time
i bet . how long will he be gone ?
maybe you could invite some of your friends over to ease your mind a bit .
oh that sounds so scary !
oh thank goodness it wasn ' t serious .
im glad the pup ##per was returned
i hate seeing dogs alone in the streets
oh no , did you catch them ?
that stink ##s
what is friday ? ! ? !
aw ##w ##w man ! you are lucky ! that sounds amazing !
did you go into your basement ?

i ' m sorry , is it because their guitarist died ?
at least they are making an album , that ' s cool .
i ' m sorry to hear that . . . don ' t blame yourself
hopefully he opens his eyes soon and realizes what he is doing
i think it ' s time to call the animal protection unit
i believe you will be fine
what job did you apply for ?
do you work for the government now ?
what was it ?
ye ##a i can understand that
that ' s good . it means you will be on vacation and having fun
oh ok . it ' s good to catch up on old times with foreign friends
i am not married , so i am not sure .
where do you go to meet women ?
no way ! i ' d be so upset . . . . how did she react ?
that ' s horrible
ou ##ch ! sorry to hear that ! are you mad at him ?
i bet he does ! but it was just an accident so hopefully you can forgive him .
that is so cool , how does that make you feel ?
yeah , those cars are really price ##y .
oh poor dog ! i hope he is okay !
i am glad to hear that . i hate seeing animals suffer .
that isn ' t good . have you spoken to him about it ?
you should talk to him . i am sure he will pick up if you do .
i can understand that , it is scary .
oh that must have been traumatic .
i would have been pissed too !
i hope so too !
oh wow . . that stink ##s
hopefully you had insurance
that is very nice of your friend .
that sounds like fun !
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that
same here . . . it really sucks
oh no , is your dog okay ?
i hope your dog is found safe .
did he catch you
well at least you were unharmed !
i bet that must have taken you back to the good old days ?
any particular memory stand out that you care to share ?
glad to hear it . did you get to relax at home ?
oh that must have been nice . it always cheers me up when my kids visit from college .
oh no ! ! did she find out about it ?
that is such sad news
that is so sad . did you comfort him ?
that is so caring of you ! good on you for being a good sam ##ari ##tan !
ah ! that must be so frustrating . you should speak to him about this .
i would be too . i want my paper on time !
that ' s terrible , what did you do ?
i hope that never happens again .
that ##s gross
wonder how it tastes
why were you scared ?
yeah , the woods can be scary at night .
that is so cool . you are so lucky to have been able to experience that .
i hope you enjoyed every minute of that . it sounds like a once in a life time experience .
nothing like mom ' s cooking !
that ' s when you know you had a good meal lo ##l
that must so inc ##on ##ven ##ient ! are you having trouble falling asleep because of it ?
oh that ##s a blessing . as long as the baby is asleep , all is good !
why were you scared to go home alone ?
that must be really annoying and scary .
those were the days !
this is true .
who ##s mom ?
im sorry to hear that .
really ? that is cool
why did you ?
those are some good cow ##or ##kers !
it ' s nice to work with people who care
i ' m sorry , i hope you find it .
i think you will be fine .
congratulations , you will be spending time with your loved one again
i hope you can propose marriage to her when you meet with her
you must be quite confident in your abilities !
good to hear . but don ' t get too over ##con ##fide ##nt !
oh my , did they let everyone else leave early except you ?
i would be upset if that happened to me . i hope they let you off early next time .
what did you do
oh that ##s good . . dan ##g kid !
that sounds like fun !
i hope you have a good time .
wow that ' s horrible . . did you confront them >
i would be too
really ?
tell me about the fun things
oh really ? how ' d you find out ?
well at least you found out easily .
i love cats , they are the best .
yes , cats can be difficult to take care of .
i can understand
i though you went earlier to impress a girl
wow ! that ' s amazing ! i ' d love it if my parents got me gifts like that ! !
i could imagine . maybe i should drop some more hints .
that is good , its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves .
he must have been very passionate about teaching his students .
oh man , where customers upset with you ?
sucks how customers blame employees like it ' s their fault
i hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it .
hopefully it wasn ' t something time important
oh did he pass ?
that ' s great , congratulations
did you look all over for them ?
that ##s good . . . they are usually always in the last place you look .
oh my goodness , that sounds absolutely terrifying . do you think they would ' ve hurt you if they found you ?
you ' d probably be having even more nightmares . i ' m glad you ' re safe , though .
that ' s a unique experience to go through . does she have a nice location picked out for it ?
cool ! that sounds really special and personal . i ' m sure they both will really enjoy that !
that is very nice of your sister !
yeah , maybe you should get her a gift of some sort .
i ' ve never actually watched that show myself . but i ' ve heard so many good things about it !
i tend to like shorter shows that don ' t have these super long ongoing plots . so i do have a bit of interest but i ' m not sure if it ' s really for e .
i ' m sorry to hear that . . . it sucks being in a " team " where no one wants to do anything
i would confront them about it to avoid it happening again
that ' s really exciting ! do you have any special plans for this weekend ?
well that does sound like a rest ##ful and relaxing weekend . i love traveling on my off time !
do you have room ##ates ?
mine does the exact same thing ! i hate it
aw ##w that had to be a little disappointing ?
yeah that can be life changing money ! maybe next time !
i am so happy for you !
old houses are the best .
as a kid ? that ' s the best !
did you go often with your family ?
oh , what is it ?
that must be so exciting !
oh no what did she say ?
i would have laughed lo ##l
you must be so proud . that really is a great accomplishment that he has made . is he going to college ?
that is so awesome . does he have a major picked out ?
was it an expensive one ?
aw ##w ##w . . . still that ##s upset ##ting
oh no ! that ' s so scary
ha ##ha silly cat !
yeah , you can really get in major trouble for doing that .
i would just not do it again .
i ' m sorry to hear that . do you know why your neighbor does that to you ?
i think you should just continue talking over your neighbor . maybe that will get your neighbor to stop .
who does she talk to on the phone regularly ?
so why does that make you discontent ##ed ?
i can imagine that would be a painful waiting period . why do you bel ##ive she is un ##fa ##ith ##ful ?
i can see the why you would feel that way . i would be worried too .
the good news is the chances of actually getting hiv is relatively low . you should not have to worry about it .
i can imagine it would . you don ##t need that stress in your life .
oh no , did it not turn out the way you planned ?
that ' s awesome ! hard work always pays off !
don ' t be so negative about it . maybe you ' ll really like the person .
so then just let the person know you can ' t make it . there ' s no reason to waste that person ' s time .
that ' s very good of you . i would be proud of myself if i can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it
i hope he or she rewarded you though
that ' s great ! what kind of car did you get ?
wow , that is a sweet ride !
oh no , what are going to do ?
i hope they can fix your glasses .
i hate when they forget the cheese
i would have been too . . i love my cheese burger ##s
that is nice to gave a friend that can help you in time of need .
that is not good but my mistake happened .
sounds pretty inc ##omp ##ete ##nt to me . have you found a new one yet ?
it seems hard finding a good doctor these days .
cong ##rat ##s ! it ' s great to pass your test . though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique .
that ' s good . i try to study well in advance . but i find it hard to actually mo ##tiv ##ate myself .
ha ##ha that ' s funny !
i ' m glad you survived lo ##l
that must be quite nos ##tal ##gic .
i miss the old times .
is it a newer model ?
i would be too
i ' m sorry to hear that . it ' s really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second .
there ' s always scalp ##ers outside of concert venues . that could probably work .
wow , what a forward woman .
yeah , i ' m sure you were .
lo ##l . . . that ##s harsh ! are you ?
ha ##ha ##h . . . that is natural
that ' s great you have that kind of confidence .
that is very responsible of you .
first of all my condo ##lence ##s for your friend , and i know how hard this is for you both
ya it feels so weak to be in that place , but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation
you can do it , i pray that you both overcome this situation with peace .
that ' s awful ! maybe you can pay them back ?
oh wow that ' s tough . hopefully they don ' t know it was you at least .
that is bad . i hope you will find something interesting to do .
i understand . probably , watching a new movie could be good idea .
oh ye ##a ? why is that ?
i wish there is a way we can make people care more about the environment
oh no , im sorry to hear that
it happens . . . but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions
that sounds so disgusting !
i would have done that too .
why she want to divorce ? did she tell you ?
that is terrible . how did you find out ?
yi ##kes , did you miss a payment ?
it shouldn ' t have , maybe you need to call customer service and question them as to why .
i am sure you are beautiful too !
i wish you had a higher self - esteem .
wow ! i can imagine how joy ##ous that feeling must have been !
cong ##rat ##s ! that would be really stress ##ful . i ' m happy it all worked out for you .
oh , no that isn ' t good . i " m sorry
did he just freeze up on the test or was it different then the stuff you studied ?
i hope all goes well . was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done ?
always good to check if in doubt
oh no i am so sorry ! i bet that must have been scary too
wow they should care more that your ##e safe !
i love pizza . what style pizza does the place make ?
yeah , that sounds very exciting .
uh ##oh i hope you didn ' t get in trouble ?
well you can use that feeling to make sure you don ' t do it again !
that is terrible . what did you do ?
well that is a good way to look at it .
that ' s great , trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships .
of course , we ' re not meant to lock ourselves away alone for our entire lives .
that is bad . did you go to a doctor ?
then nothing to worry about .
i do too . it always brings back so many good memories .
yes it is . sometimes i wish you could just go back to that time .
i am sorry to hear that . thieves are really crap ##py people .
i hope they catch the person and you get your laptop back .
oh wow ! are you okay ?
that is insane . thank god there was someone there to intervene .
oh why is that ? do you play ?
ah , yeah my husband is the same way . he is very excited .
good for him ! that ' s a very valuable skill to have , good on you for teaching him so early .
does he seem to enjoy being in the water , or does he resist you a bit ?
oh i know that feeling actually . . . did you ever make up with your friend ?
that ' s good to hear . it ' s all water under the bridge now , as they say .
that sounds like fun , what kind of movie will you see ?
nice , i love those . i have seen a preview for a shark attack movie that is coming out . i think called meg , i hope to see that sometime
i love eating there , the food is always amazing .
i am glad you had such a good meal .
i hope it wasn ' t a close friend that lied .
that is sad . liar ##s and thieves are just the worst .
i don ' t blame you . a friend like that isn ' t a friend at all . i ' m sorry that has happened to you .
that ' s embarrassing , but also funny . how did your date react ?
that is awesome that she didn ' t make a big scene of it !
why ?
i understand . it could be little bit scary at first but it is fun .
aw ##w : ( what did you end up doing instead ?
you could ' ve always come on here and chat with other cool people like you : d
oh no , are they going to be okay ?
oh , that will be so fun !
oh my , i hope she is ok ?
i would be too ! was she at fault ?
wow . it is very un ##su ##al to see that .
why ? do you want to do like him ?
that is so sweet of your child .
he must be very smart !
that ' s annoying ! did you end up eating it anyway ?
sorry that you had a bad experience !
wow , what ' s the special occasion ?
yeah , that is going to be a lot of work , and hard to transport to your job .
aw ##w was it your birthday or something ?
o ##oo kid rock that ' s one of my friends favorites !
i bet , its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like . where do you work ?
that does suck . i work at ta ##co bell making burr ##ito ##s .
you must be very proud of your new set of teeth
cong ##rat ##s you can smile freely now : )
what preferences do you mean ? you shouldn ' t have to say your truth to anyone .
there ' s nothing wrong with that and it ' s a shame people even question you about that .
congratulations ! when is the wedding ?
i ' m happy for you , i hope everything continues to work out !
oh no ! that is so sad for you . how embarrassing .
how sad . i am so sorry you had to deal with that .
oh no ! did you manage to avoid a stain ?
don ' t feel ashamed . you ' ll be able to laugh about it soon enough !
how did it went ?
that is terrible . what are going to do ?
oh god that sounds terrible ! are you okay , is everyone in your house okay ? did anyone get hurt ?
i ' m glad to hear that no one in your house got hurt . gang crime needs to be stopped !
i ' m sorry that happened . do you still have contact with him ?
cl ##iche as it is , time heal ##s all wounds and what ##not . i hope you can find somebody just as great as him or learn to be content on your own !
that is horrible ! do you think it is really true , or she was trying to just make you angry ?
you can always try to get a dna test .
are you worried and nervous ?
i hope they do and everything is ok
that is terrible .
who fault it was ?
sorry to hear that . is the feeling mutual ?
that is awful ! hopefully things work out for the better for you !
oh my lord , i would have been terrified . are you okay ?
i am glad to hear you are okay .
i feel you ! summer is great and all but i miss my classmates and the work i ' m studying .
i hope you have a successful semester !
how did you do ?
congratulations , i hope you get a raise .
oh . i hope you get it !
that ' s a pretty substantial raise !
oh no ! what happened ?
wow ! i would have been sp ##ook ##ed about that too . what did you do ?
are you ?
that ##s true .
how fun ! how did you all celebrate ?
that ' s really nice of you . catfish sure sounds good to me right now !
yeah , i remember mine as well . they were always a great time .
that sounds like so much fun , too bad those times had to ever end .
wow ! cong ##rat ##s ! was it hard contest ?
you must be very smart !
nice ! what kind of car is it
you ' re pretty lucky to have a boss like that ha ##ha
oh goodness , that is terrible .
yeah , delivery services have really fallen off .
om ##g ! how nasty !
did he at least offer to share with you ?
i ' m sorry that happened . maybe she was tired from working all day .
oh , i understand . have you talked to her about how you feel about it ?
i have never had greek cuisine
there aren ' t many restaurants where i live . only fast food .
that is great , she will fit right in !
what an excellent way to start school !
what are union me ##m ##ners points ?
oh . maybe they should lower the fees or up the rewards
sounds fun ! what movie are you going to watch ?
oh . well that ' s lovely . . i suppose . lo ##l . maybe you should amend the movie night rules with a different theme every time so they are more constrained to what they have to choose from ! ha ##ha !
nervous ? that ' s interesting . has anything changed recently ? what are your thoughts on why it ' s happening ?
i see . i ' m sorry you ' re having trouble with that . have you thought about therapy ? maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something . or perhaps you just need a simple routine change , with some exercise and more time outside . i hope you find the answer , whatever it is .
that was rough , how long ago was this ?
i ' m sorry you had to endure this .
that ' s pretty nice . i ' m in college , and i ' ve had three different roommate ##s so far , having to move three different times . starting to get old . you truly luck ##ed out !
i hope you guys are able to keep in touch . with that kind of experience , it sounds like it could be a good friend for life . as we get older , we let those kinds of people slip through our fingers . try to maintain it as best you can .
that is too bad . what are you going to do ? was this your first time gambling ?
that is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way . i am sorry .
it ' s nice that you tried to comfort him . i ' m worried about my parents , also . it ' s hard to be worried about something like that in your family , knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen . it ' s sad .
agreed - it ' s very stress ##ful . i live half a country away from my parents , and i ' m worried i won ' t be able to help when either of them need it .
i feel for you . my girlfriend is in the same position . luckily we don ' t have kids to com ##pl ##icate things , but her job wears her out and it doesn ' t seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it . kids just make it so that you feel you have to do it until you die , no matter what .
at least it sounds like you ' re giving it a lot of thought . you sound res ##ili ##ent . most people would just quit or get fired , or not even realize the negative impact it ' s putting on their children . you seem very self - aware , so i ' m sure you will be able to figure out the best decision for everyone involved . good luck !
what did he do ?
that stink ##s . i ' m sorry about that
om ##g i was about to say that is so mean and rude and i would be so embarrassed but i know it was a honest mistake i dislike the auto correct .
lo ##l i hope your friend understood and they can still meet up or communicate and if things work out it ' s a funny to tell in the future .
what happens on saturday ?
that sounds really cool . have fun !
i think it ' s about time you lay down some rules !
is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids ?
oh my yeah i would have been pretty irritated !
yes it stink ##s when things just don ##t work out , but keep your head up , im sure you will find someone you like that will be a big help to you !
nice ! six months is a long time to be car - less . i ' m sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while he ' s at work now .
that ' s funny - true . hopefully the good part out ##weig ##hs that , though .
well that still makes you a great friend !
sounds like you all should stay away from bars lo ##l . but if it keeps you acting good at home , then so be it . your friend sounds like he needs a crack too
that ' s cool . what type of supplements
that sounds pretty healthy . have you always been this health conscious
have you had trouble lately ?
i hope things go well for you too .
oh really ? i hate winter though ! i don ' t want that to arrive : )
i prefer it over the winter if i have to make a choice
it ' s nice that you have a meaningful item from her . it ' s a pretty bitter ##sw ##eet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone .
that ' s nice - it ' s nice that you have memories like that . i only have a couple of items from my grandparents , and i treasure them .
that would take such toll one me . just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe .
might have to bring them to the park and tire them out . school should starting up soon .
that ' s awesome ! it ' s always pleasant to have a good day .
little surprises like that really bring a new meaning to life !
oh , i hate it when that happens : ( have you looked on places like mer ##car ##i or e ##bay ?
yes ! i get makeup i need more than half off on those places
i find this context hard to believe .
oh gee ##z ! really , that is interesting , but why would they want too !
are you a cop yourself
dan ##g whereabouts do you live man ? i ' m in south texas sometimes cops are like that here too
well that is kind of you . they must really be going through something .
that would be a lot to deal with . i hope things stay good for awhile .
oh god ! i would be so ticked ! do they have cameras ?
that is awful ! my mom had that happen too - an old guy hit her at ##the gas station and sped off ! seriously not fair ! !
oh man that sounds horrible . i would probably faint .
it must have hurt so much .
that ##s amazing , i am sorry for your loss , but at ##lea ##st you have a constant reminder of him .
that ##s so sweet . he is probably looking down happy you are wearing it !
oh no ! , did you ever end finishing it up in time ?
that ##s good , i just finished studying for a final , and i barely finished in time !
oh no that ' s terrible ! are you going to apply again ?
i understand . maybe apply at a different bank this time .
woo ##w . that is terrifying . are you alright ? do you live in some rural areas ?
thankfully . hearing your story , i am terrified now to even walk in my back yard anymore
yes , that always sad ##den ##s me too . i see them now and then .
yeah , there should be , but often there is not really a good option for them .
good for you . being honest is important .
sometimes that ' s the best way to learn
the note is for what ?
well , expect my note too , though it would be a soft copy
what country ? if you don ' t mind sharing . . . i ' m in south texas and loving it : )
i ' m sure you ' ll meet some cool people if you find a good ph ##o restaurant !
wow she must really fancy you . you should ask her how she found you .
what a random surprise . just make sure its not some creepy stalker .
oh that is so gross ! i hate bugs too !
i hope none of them found a way home with you .
wow , so close to graduation ! what does he want to do after he graduates ?
oh no ! i hope you ' re able to . i know its hard for kids to look at the longer , bigger picture of life sometimes and just what he ' s going through now . i took my ge ##d early at 16 and graduated so maybe he wants to do that and start something else sooner .
budget for what ?
you mean you have a budget for life ?
what ?
maybe she has too much on her plate ?
mistakes happen ! i am sure people aren ' t too upset . i have numb hands so i drop things all the time
that is true ! but it ' s part of life , stuff happens . not the worst !
feeling a bit scared about the weekend .
i have a hard time with my anxiety sometimes and i will be alone a lot this weekend . i don ' t like free time , i like to stay busy so i don ' t think much .
i don ' t trust a lot of people . i do like being alone sometimes but if not then i just want to be with someone i trust - they are not always available .
that ' s annoying . so , does it still work and it ' s just hard to use , or does it just do nothing in general ? deals are always tricky like that , as sometimes they ' re too good to be true .
yeah , especially since customer service is usually where companies ski ##mp and don ' t try to hire or train employees very well . well , i hope it has a good resolution in the end and something works out in your favor . i ' m a clean freak , so i ' d hate to not be able to clean properly when i wanted or needed to .
that is just sad of a dad to be that way . kids need a lot of un ##con ##ditional love . . but parents aren ' t always perfect and sometimes don ' t know how to love their kids like they should !
still doesn ' t make it okay . i hope he gets some therapy and learns to be a better dad
oh gross ! they should have street cleaner ##s taking care of that . poor animal .
i bet . i have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too . i can ' t stand seeing injured , hurt , or dead animals . hope you ' re feeling better now .
i bet you are proud !
good i wish him all the best !
i agree . i used to be a dead ##beat but now my life is do ##pe . are you talking about a friend or family member
yes you can lead a horse to water . . . but you know the rest
definitely not a sucker ! if she helped you a lot and you wouldn ' t be here without her , then yes ! why did she block you ? were you bad to her ? sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few . . . i was there for them but had enough and i have had to cu ##it them out too -
that is hard . . i have been abused and burned . . . and sometimes you just can ' t go back . . it ' s like the story of a the girl with the feather pillow . . once you say something . . you can ' t ever get it back and it ' s so hard to repair . its hard to ever trust someone once they have broken it . . i am there myself and don ' t know if i could ever trust or live with that person again . life is hard but i am very glad you have learned and will treat others better
that ' s always a weird situation . you ' re excited about the offer , and you ' re worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else , or as good . but you also don ' t want to be tied down to a bad place . what were some of the red flags , if you don ' t mind me asking ?
that ' s a really tough position to put yourself in . you would know better than most . i ' m a cautious person . . if i felt like there was even a 50 % chance of being able to find something close to decent , i ' d turn them down . but if you think it ' s a desert out there and you can ' t find something to come close , it may be worth grit ##ting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on . i hope it works out !
that is tough . i would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just un ##wind . maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after .
i see . i would maybe only bring it up if she wants to discuss . it a hard position to be in .
anywhere else ? lo ##l - you do not have a lot of thai places in town ?
everything to me lo ##l ! sweet and sour chicken is the best
that sounds like a fine day to me . do you have many birds ?
ha ##h i know how you feel i love to feed birds and watch them outside my house as well .
oh no ! i am so sorry - turtles need a lot of care to thrive
actually they are , that is why so many die in captivity . . they need proper lights and diet etc . . i guess if you know how to take care of animals then no - but so many just don ' t care when they have a pet who relies on them
what happened to the first one ?
i ' m sure it will be fine . did you buy a good brand ?
yeah occasionally stuff breaks during shipping .
so sorry , you never really can tell with these things can you ?
i wish you good luck .
me too . i can ##t take this heat anymore . it is so mug ##gy outside . its so annoying .
same here . the humidity is just the absolute worse .
is there anything like free cash ?
i had that nothing good come easily
oh nice . what type of presentation
you think it will be a big success ?
that ' s awesome ! any new changes lately ?
that sounds fun ! i ' m glad your ##e more comfortable now .
can you have it repaired ?
yes , i ' m sure you ' ll be very nice to her .
i am so sorry . i know that must be a difficult time .
i hope you can find the positive in the situation and move forward . focus on yourself .
that should be fun . where does the cruise go to ?
the bahamas is beautiful . i am sure you will love it .
they really do make you stronger don ##t they . it may not seem like it right away though .
that is a great way to make the best out of the worst . good for you .
good luck ! hope you do well
i ' m sure you ' ll get a good grade if you prepared well
wow , that ' s gr ##ate . are you also a musician ?
complete family with so much talent
that makes you a queen .
what ' s that ?
wow ! that would be an awesome surprise to come home to !
i would love to have that happen for me ! you are lucky !
oh you did ? what kind of job ?
are you a st ##yl ##ist ?
that ' s great ! how can you tell you are on the right path ?
cong ##rat ##s ! that ' s awesome
that is good , i hope nothing went wrong
you should be proud of them . nothing like family
i hope it works out for you then .
well stick in there and you ' ll go far .
wow , that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it !
excellent , hopefully you will share some of your wealth with me .
that ' s great . she sounds like a passionate and independent woman .
i wish her and you the most abundant blessings and wealth and success .
that was nice of him . what was it ?
that is great ! were you able to help pick it out ?
what kind of weather is that ?
ya ##h , safety first .
what kind of fun did you remember having there
wow quite a long time
he should be fine if he has prepared . i hope he does well .
that great . im sure you are real proud of him .
oh well maybe you ' ll get your blessings in a different way you didn ' t expect
it ' s cool , i got fired from my old job 5 months ago . . . only to upgrade to a self - employed lifestyle , making 2000 a week and hot chicks coming in and out of my apartment every night lo ##l
its sad but true , people don ##t want to see others doing well ! got to be ready to protect what is yours !
just keep working , learning and trying new things , can ##t go wrong like that i think !
sounds exciting !
well i hope you have fun and i hope she does well .
i bet that was frightening and nerve rack ##ing .
at least you made it through all ##right .
did you play there a lot as a child ?
well , i hope you can recover from that as time passes .
im sorry to hear that . how long has she been sick ?
absolutely ! i would do anything for my kids too .
because she wanted to give you a surprise present
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha ##h , i like the suspense , she is good at giving surprises
horror movies give me so much anxiety . i can ##t watch them late at night .
maybe watch a comedy tonight . that might help out a little .
that is amazing . those moments are wonderful and price ##less ! how old is she now ?
i love when they are young and it so fun to see what they learn and discover each day . when they say enjoy every moment , they are so right !
it is the start of their learning journey , be excited !
definitely , i wish them the best
oh no , have you made adjustments to ensure that won ##t happen again ?
i bet , kids need a lot of eyes on them , but its a catch - 22 because you do not want to be too over protective
oh no , is she ok ?
i ' m so sorry . do you have a good support system ?
how much is that ?
oh wow , that will help you out immensely .
the quality of driving is going down and down .
yeah , i agree . we ' ve have to drive carefully .
did you want to go to new york ?
maybe you will win something else !
oh no ! was it a big one or not that big of a deal ?
oh good . well , at least its a big deal to you because that means you ' re taking things seriously and concerned about your work .
oh no , did people make you feel bad for the accident ?
that sucks , if everyone pitched in to help it probably would ' ve been cleaned up in record time .
yes all it takes is cutting back on some things you maybe don ##t need . i know it can be hard to do though !
yes ! even $ 5 a week helps !
oh that ' s terrible ! what did you do with it ?
good choice . can ' t mess with a brown rec ##lus ##e .
do you think it will be good news or bad news ?
very exciting . i hope you get it .
awesome , do you plan to go early to try and get auto ##graphs ?
enjoy yourself , if i may , refrain from recording it on your phone , just be in the moment !
i personally have not , you must have though ?
that ' s amazing . you sound extremely confident !
oh no , did you get angry with him ?
that ##s a fair punishment , they have to learn somehow
oh how exciting , to the big island or somewhere else ?
take advantage and make a lot of memories with your family !
oh no . i am so sorry . i have been there and its devastating . how is everyone doing ?
it will take time . allow yourself to gr ##ie ##ve and also doing something to remember your pet can help give closure . take care and take a day at a time .
that ' s cool . what does she want to do there ?
that ' s cool . i have worked in a hospital as a nurse before .
what role did your child use .
awesome , i am sure you are proud of his individual effort .
do you have something exciting happening ?
that ' s great ! i would be pumped !
is there another class you can apply for ?
that is a shame , keep your head up and hopefully you can get into it next year .
oh that ' s really lucky ! what happened , did someone run a light or something ?
that stink ##s , but i ' m glad he ' s ok ! that must be the scar ##iest thing !
do you know what kind of spider it was ?
did it get you ?
oh yeah ? what kind of activities ?
oh neat . i love those kinds of games .
what exactly happened ?
could you call the police ?
uh ##m ##nn ##n ! so what then happened after that ?
so how did you respond to that ?
i haven ' t , though i ' ve stepped in other po ##o . is it similar to others ?
dog mostly , cat once or twice . possibly human , but i ' d rather not think too hard on that .
oh good . i ' m glad you were prepared . how did it go ?
perfect ! nothing better than being prepared and accomplish ##ing something well ! great job !
that ' s exciting ! how do you feel about it ?
that sounds great . i hope it goes well !
oh i have always wanted to live at the beach , i bet you will have a blast
best part about it is you will never have to leave !
i hate parking tickets ! what a rip off . how did it go ?
sounds like you were prepared . did you get it dismissed ?
the company must be doing well then ?
ah ##h i see what you are saying . maybe ya ##ll will get bonuses .
just show them what you have accomplished this past year
just be confident in your ability !
congratulations ! what degree did you get ?
awesome ! i bet that ' s a really versatile degree , you should be really successful !
oh man ! that was so nice of him ! you ' re lucky to have him
hopefully you can pay him back in some way !
are you fully prepared for it ?
great , good luck to you !
why do you think that is ?
yes , do you ever remember playing in the ocean ?
oh man , kids can be terrible about things like that . they just have no filter . what did you do ?
well , that ' s the best you can do , is teach them what ' s appropriate and what isn ' t . i think you handled it well .
so did she accept your proposal ?
that ##s nice to know , hope you find happiness together ?
how proud of him were you ?
just keep admiring your child .
that ' s pretty good . you know what they say , " c ' s get degrees " !
i know i sure didn ' t in college . did you get a job in your desired field ? that ' s what really matters .
have you thought about telling the store ?
to clear your conscious
that ' s great ! what will you do with all the extra time together ?
sounds like fun to me ! enjoy the time .
those two years must have been tough . but this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you !
good luck in the final stage . i hope you get the job .
they ' re super creepy . did something happen ?
i understand that . they just give off such bad vibe ##s .
can you go to a shelter ?
stay away from the windows just in case .
that is so wonderful that you have something of hers . i ' m so sorry you lost her . that is so difficult . did she love cooking ?
you still have her right there with you ! its wonderful to know that you ' re keeping her food and memories so alive !
ye ##a that is kind of a weird situation . i am sure she would want you to have a good time though .
i wouldn ##t let it ruin a good time . just don ##t mention it anymore maybe . im sure you feel a little guilty .
are you glad you watched tv all night or did you wish you ' d done something else ?
oh , i know how that feels . i ' ve done that myself nearly every night .
that ##s really sweet of you and i bet it means the world to those people . its great to show kids compassion and being nice to people
i remember being scared the first time i went to visit my great grandmother in a nursing home . but once you see that they are just people it makes everything alright
that must be hard having to be happy for someone that has what you wanted .
it ' s normal to be jealous . it is a product of goals not fulfilled .
camp ##ers are awesome , have you tried social ##ising with him ? maybe ##e he can invite you to see it from the inside
ha ##ha ##ha ##h i bet he is a nice guy and will let you see it
i ' m right there with you ! i hate pine ##apple on pizza , it doesn ' t belong !
it throws off the flavor of pizza completely .
that is sad , but maybe you ' ll make new friends at school . is it your first year ?
i ' m sure it ' ll be fine . everybody will be in the same boat . i hope it goes well .
that ##s great ! at least you found it
i would do the same if i had something special like that
that ##s unfortunate , maybe she will learn eventually though
she will be fine then !
oh no , were you driving in it , or were you actually outside ?
was it a thunder ##storm ?
what did they do to sc ##am you ?
what was the opportunity ?
did you put money on the reno ?
ha ##ha , that wasn ' t very wise .
that ' s great ! are you excited about school too ?
oh ##h wow ! well good luck and i hope you have a great time with your friends and school
wow , that is horrible , what did you guys come down with ?
wow , i hope you guys get better if you already haven ' t . that ' s really a bum ##mer to miss out on a family vacation !
that ' s wonderful ! i know how important that can be ! our family of 4 only has one car so you need it to work ! what happened to yours ?
awesome ! i know , isn ' t that crazy how much repairs can cost ? its ridiculous . well , happy travels !
oh yeah ? what ' s happening on saturday ?
congratulations ! i hope you have something fun planned to celebrate .
what is it about ?
the sounds very interesting , i am sure you could find others like it as well
did you do it on pour ##pus ##e ? and if so did you feel bad after ?
but it was an accident on your part so don ##t feel so bad about it
was it yours ?
e ##w ##w . im sorry about that . that would have ruined my lunch quickly
they must be a very good insurance company to be able to keep your business for that l ##no ##g !
well that ' s always a plus . having a good relationship with the company or someone at the company can go a long way .
that is amazing . most of those guys have been training for years for that level of eating . what kind of pie ##s were they ?
he really should . some of those folks make really good money just to eat a lot . pretty sweet gig ! ha ##ha ##ha .
oh no ! sorry to hear that . can you get it fixed ?
wow that ' s expensive ! i hope you can find a reasonable used car .
that ' s cool , i ' m not too familiar with it myself . is it pretty interesting so far ?
it ' s always nice to get lost in a good book . one of my favorite ho ##bbies .
oh no ! that is always terrible when technology stops working well . what did you do to fix it ?
that ' s awesome ! you are talented ! maybe it ' ll go for another year so you can save .
congratulations ! if it helps at all , my wife and i have two young boys and both of her deliveries with very smooth ! she said it wasn ' t as bad as she expected .
i think those types of situations are rather rare ! the medical field has come a very long way . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine and it ' ll all be worth it in the end .
im glad you were not harmed
im sorry , im sure it wasn ##t your fault
that ' s great ! i love to design websites
that ' s neat ! i learned in college so i ' ve had time to del ##ve into it quite a bit and it is very fun . you choose great !
that ' s no good ! sorry about the rug . is she still a puppy ?
i ' m sure she ' ll learn quickly , and she ' ll be a good dog then !
disneyland is awesome , i went there twice as a kid ! what did you have to eat ?
that ' s true , it ' s like a whole different world when you are inside the park ! very magical .
so do you hope to do there ?
can i join you ?
where are you headed ?
wow ! well i hope you enjoy yourself and pray before you go on the plane
im sorry to hear that . how did she die ?
oh wow ! that stink ##s . how are you holding up ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that ! my sister went through something similar last year and i can tell you that it will help a lot to spend time with her as often as you can .
stay strong ! hopefully in the future she can have a healthy baby and be able to move on from this tragedy .
aw , that ' s never fun . my husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely . i ' m glad she won ' t be gone too long . i took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned .
wow , you ' re on top of things ! being apart does make the heart grow fond ##er . : ) make ( or carry out ) her a romantic dinner when she gets back . go out with a friend while she ' s gone !
did you do everything right ?
well that stink ##s . that happens though . sometimes you do something right and it doesn ' t show the same result as its supposed to
why didn ' t you sleep well ?
i am sorry . you should get some sleep now then
oh no , why ' d you have to cancel ?
maybe you can plan for another time ?
holy cow ! that ' s amazing ! cong ##rat ##s !
that ' s really amazing . how generous .
i hate when that happens . in my case it was a dog , i caught him on camera ! maybe you should invest in a security cam ?
i hear if you sp ##rin ##kle red pepper all over your trash area it can help ward off some animals .
oh no ! that would ' ve made me so mad . i let my kids use my computer too but always say , no drinks by it and wash your hands . kids always seem to forget that .
it is a hard balance because they need to learn and it should make you mad , but people do make mistakes . so hard to know how to act really but things are too expensive to not treat them well . i hope you ' re able to find an easier way to fix it .
did you not go ?

i think that can affect even the best of us , i wouldn ' t let it get you down .
that ##s really sweet of you to help her out .
ha ##ha , ye ##a that ##s a good way to look at it . i never thought of it like that
are you scared you may want to in the future and it would be too late ?
it is never too late ! you can always adopt !
my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it
ha ##ha . it ' s al ##ot of work but it ' s reward ##ing

my thoughts and prayers are with you guys . i hope you succeed . make sure you keep practicing
that is awful , why did he do that
did you tell him the truth ?
i can imagine that was very scary ! i don ' t know if i would be that brave !
i guess it was a lifetime opportunity too . i ' m sure it was an amazing experience !
why do you feel that way
that does sound hard
uh ##oh . be careful , there are some bad drivers out there . especially with people playing on their phones while driving
iv ##e actually called the police during a situation like that . i was worried someone was going to get killed
do you guys not get together as much ?
i know that feeling , i have a brother i don ' t see as much as i used to .
dogs are the best
that was very nice of you
i love driving past old places from my childhood too ! they always seem much smaller than i remember
its great that you were able to go visit
that doesn ##t sound very safe . i hope you don ##t lose power
well stay inside and stay dry
that sucks . i know how you feel . do you have a day job ?
that sucks . i ' ve also been through that . among other benefit cuts .
that ##s pretty neat . i think that might be worth a lot of money
well that might make it more valuable to you then . does it still work ?
well . . . did you ?
ah too bad you ' re married . pro ' s and con ' s
u ##gh . those are the worst .
i wish people could be more consider ##ate on the road . its so annoying .

oh no , that is scary ! did his owner get control of him quickly ?
goodness , it was a good thing you were right there and able to usher them inside so quickly . i can ' t imagine the results had you not been able to get to them quick enough !
the unknown gives me so much stress
it get so bad i get severe anxiety
im sorry to hear that , is he going to the doctor for help ?
oh wow it sounds like he is doing great , i hope he feels better soon !
i completely understand
i feel for you and hope you have a way to manage it
i bet ! i would be so jealous , too ! maybe your neighbor will let you come over and swim ?
that ' s a great way to look at it - take advantage of their investment for now - and then later you can have your own pool !
wow ! that is cool , do you spend a lot of time with him ?
i hope you many more years of happy marriage !
did everything turn out alright ?
hopefully they can work it out
i bet that was fun
its nice to get a good sweat
that ' s no fun ! how long did they have you waiting ?
don ' t be too angry . they might just have been swamp ##ed with prescription ##s to fill .
it will be worth it though
i am sure you will be safe
yeah , i don ' t think anyone likes going . how did it go ?
i am glad you got the help you needed , and i hope you get better soon .
ou ##ch , are you alright ?
i bet . did your work cover your medical bills ?
oh yi ##ppe ##ee ! what kind of puppy ?
i bet . dogs are amazing . we have a big ole mu ##tt who is 75 lbs of lap dog love
oh wow , that would be nice
it gives you something to work for
yeah that ' s sad , i hope it found it ' s owner somehow .
yeah , you can ' t always help everybody and everything though .
try not to be . focus on yourself and your goals . use their judgment ##al looks to push you workout to the max !
i hope it helps !
bosses are sometimes unaware it seems
i would hate working there
i have a pet rabbit . that makes me sad
sometimes on my way to work i find deer , sk ##unk , cats , mis ##c other dead animals and it makes me so sad
why do you say that
well that is what makes life fun
wow that ' s super lucky ! so you have no idea where it came from ?
that ' s a true blessing . i am very happy for you !
that is so funny , but i know exactly how you feel . sometimes vacation ##s can get too long . did you leave town ?
that sounds like a heck of a trip !

kids can be annoying
screaming is never good

i am a saints fan , so i am excited too ha
i read it today , he is a different kind of guy for sure
that is a great attitude to have . i know it is hard to go through periods of struggle . do you have hope that things will get better soon ?
that is phenomena ##l ! in hard times it is easy to di ##sta ##ce ourselves from god , but i believe it is important to press in and cast our cares on him .
oh really ? actually i think that is a good thing . how ' s is going ?
i think that ' s a good decision by your and your wife . and i think your wife ' s grandmother is going to recover well .
they will be good again

yeah , i do agree . sometimes it seems like people are just plain blessed .
i get that , but things are still better for those around you , so it feels bad still
i get that , but things are still better for those around you , so it feels bad still

just thinking positive thoughts
its good to have faith
ok , if that ' s what you decide to do i believe you have had time to think it through

i ' m sorry that happened . you deserve better friends than them anyway .
oh boy , sounds like a terrible time ! did you drink water ?
that ' s great that you got it repaired . else your house would ' ve been a sa ##una .
my dad used to play hand ball . it was very fun and interesting watching them play when i was a kid
yeah . it needs more exposure
oh man that is the worst feeling . did you have to wash the dishes ?
well at least you didn ' t have to walk out without paying . good decision .
that sounds lonely . why did you go alone ?
that is really messed up . was it at least a good movie ?
that really sucks . did you get in trouble ?
aw ##w ##w ##w , that ' s terrible . i hope you find him !
are you going to be able to get that money ?
i hope everything works out for you .
are you having desperate times ?
i think you need to go and talk to someone , your pastor may be the best place to start .
i hear you ! i am in that boat too ! it can be very hard to be alone a lot
those are not friends
what savage ##s ! did you tell the drive through guy ?
i ' m not sure , but i ' m not liking where society is heading these days .

teach him a lesson !
i would be mad too . did you find the cu ##lp ##rit ?
that really sucks . are you going to get it fixed ?
wow that ' s great !
i hate when that happens . . . so many channels , nothing to watch
where are you going
that sounds fun
oh , that ' s so cool !
that ' s a smart kid !
that sucks . did you catch the cu ##lp ##rit ?
i would be too ! did you buy a new one ?
run !
grab your gun and take names .
sounds like you were pretty well prepared . how ##d it go ?
awesome . great job . what kind of job is it ?
happy early birthday !
are you going to have a party ?
that ' s no good . did he ever repay you ?
what a jerk . i would take it to judge judy .
that seems like a nice memory
it ' s nice remembering the good times
aw ##w ##w ##w , that ' s sad . why is it your last day ?
well , i suppose it ' ll be a different experience . i am sure you ' ll meet a bunch of new cool people .
i ' ve never been there , did you enjoy it ?
i think i need to go there , everyone seems to love it .
i feel sorry for your friend .
that is such a terrible story .
that really sucks . sounds like a regular ole fide ##l castro .
true . kids always get up to no good at night !
o ##ops ##ie !
maybe she is sick
do you hon ##k your horn at them ?
that is true . it is always better to be safe than sorry .

that sounds horrible . . . i ' m sorry that happened to you
e ##w no way ! lo ##l
nice ! what are you planning on doing ?
sounds like the ultimate plan to me . i think i will do the same .
what was the instance ? something bad or good ?
whoa that is not cool . i would be so ticked off .
did he turn around there and go and pick that on up ?
you should inform the local police , they will def ##inate ##ly pick that person up !
did you punish your dog ?
that ' s good . your dog will learn .
nice ! what color is it ?
yeah , they aren ' t too hard to put together . they ' re really fun too !
oh no ! is it a puppy or perhaps sick ?
perhaps she had an upset tu ##mmy or something . sometimes with dogs it ' s hard to tell .
that sounds like fun ! where are you taking them ? the junk ##yard ?
aw , that ' s sounds like so much fun ! you sound like awesome parents : )
i love madden , i can ' t wait to play it !
i am so jealous !
whoa , is the other woman more attractive ?
how long have you been married ?
my crocodile always does that
get a pro ##st ##hetic . i can ##t spell
what a tragedy ! did anyone say anything about it ?
i am sure you did , but at least you don ' t look crazy every day like i do .
ha ##ha that sounds just like my husband !
well sometimes men tend to get lost in their video game world
that ' s awesome ! you must be a hard worker to be so confident !
oh well in that case , i ' m sure you ' ll get it ! he must have confidence in you too .
i am sure you will do well !
just stay positive and everything will work out .
how do you think you did on it ?
i am sure you did fine on it . and besides , if you did poorly , there is always the good ole local mcdonald ##s .
i can understand that - i think all of us , at one point or another , did something we were ashamed of .
i know that feeling , kinda sick to your stomach can ' t get it out of your head kinda thing . we all have to have a method to overcome it and move on .
aw , that ' s nice . did they get along ?
oh god , that is ho ##rri ##fying ! i would ' ve wanted to hide under a rock too !
i know what you mean , i long for the day when mine grow up and go away to college .
they can be ram ##bu ##nc ##tious , mine drive me up the wall sometimes .
i know that feeling
im sorry . it will happen til someone else soon enough
oh man ! which one was it ?
i saw that movie too ! one of the scar ##iest i have ever seen .
are you prepared for it ?
absolutely , that ' s the spirit !
aw , why is that ? is it acting up ?
why is that ? the military isn ' t so bad . the pay is really nice if you stick around for a bit .
how do you think you are going to do ?
i am confident you will do well !
well that ' s great ! has she practiced enough to get her actual license ?
oh yes , definitely . it ' s other drivers you have to watch out for . people halfway pay attention to what they ' re doing on the road !
that was very nice of you ! i wish more people would react the way that you did .
and that ' s all we really can do honestly , if more people did that this world would be a better place all around .
i love pe ##can pie . my grandma used to make it
they can make their own pie ##s
yeah i know how that is . my kids eat me out of house and home .
well kids do need to eat . they grow up so quickly .
that sounds revolt ##ing ! what did you do ?
poor frog . may it rest in peace . i will pray for it tonight .
are you going to get a new one ?
do you live near the rockies ?
that is good of you to support her .
you have a great family !
that is just gross ! did you say anything to him , like " dude , what are you doing ? "
well , if you ' ve ever seen friends , rachel makes a tri ##fle with whipped cream , bananas , jam , and ground beef and peas ! !
is there some good news ?
that is such a heart ##war ##ming story !
do you feel as prepared as you can be for it ?
well that is a great attitude , i bet you will do amazing ! !
oh no ! that ' s terrible
how did it even roll ##away if its that huge ?
oh yeah ? that ' s pretty nice that you would help her out like that .
wow , that would make me mad too . what a devi ##ous sc ##amp !
that is really sad and devastating .
i am glad to hear he is doing better .
that ##s great i hope you get it !
money is always good , and you will be near your son hopefully he does not find it embarrassing , u know how kids are
damn you are the mvp . i have only eaten two in a day . i am jealous .
well maybe they should think about emi ##grating south . i heard the charter schools there are sub ##par .
well , kids eventually grow and become independent . maybe you can try and go fishing with them or something ? or a family picnic ?
that would work too ! or maybe a good meal ?
that ' s really not good . did you feel bad about it ?
maybe you should see a counselor . or just get out of the relationship .
so what did you do ? did you confront him ?
i can ' t find words to describe my laughter right now . you are the best
what did you do for you ?
that is such a bold move to make . congratulations !
do you enjoy cooking for others or for the event you are taking it to ?
i bet it will be great - i ' ve always loved a good tuna cass ##ero ##le !
that ' s fantastic ! was anyone around to witness the glory ?
you deserve a purple heart for the bravery you showed today .
that ' s awesome , congratulations !
you must be so proud of her
that would scare the heck out of me ! how did you find out what it was ?
what a crazy night ! i bet you didn ' t get much sleep .
is your dog still a puppy ?
i ' m sure she will grow out of it .
oh wow . what for ?

o ##oo ##o i love gifts ! ! ! i know it ' s never " about the gift " but ok , it is so nice to get presents ! !
while i understand the motives behind your deception , i must caution that it may catch up with you one day . how did you do it ?
that ' s ok . everyone makes mistakes , just study hard and don ' t do it again in the future .
was it on a scratch off ?
that ##s awesome ! i need some of that luck

yeah it sounds like she did take advantage . that ' s a cruel thing to do .
i love pick ##les and i always order extra ! we must be twins !
6 ? ? how is that extra ? 12 - that would be extra - crazy ! ! !
it seems like a nice way to relax
i will try that when the weather is cooler
that really sucks . maybe you should force feed him some mel ##aton ##in ?
oh , well hopefully that works . wouldn ' t want you up all night !
nice , what was the occasion ?
that is a great thing . i wish i had a girlfriend like that .
that ' s really terrible . are you going to get a new one ?
that ' s a good idea . or i would adopt one . i adopted two from pets ##mart and it only cost me 15 bucks !
i ' m sorry , does that happen often ?
i hope they treat you better in the future .
oh no ! what did you do ? are you going to dispute it ?
well that ' s a relief ! wouldn ' t want the irs to seize your house !
i ' ve never used one . how did it work out for you ?
i can understand that ! it ' s crazy how scary things can be out there now - and the news does not help at all ! but i ' m glad you are safe ! !
i love horses ! has she been riding a long time ?
oh no ! i ' m glad she was okay !
did you get to try some good food ?

oh no ! i ' m sure it didn ' t do it on purpose
poor parrot

gotta put up with some discomfort to make dat bank .
monsters under the bed ?
i used to believe they were in my closet too
oh yeah ? when are you heading over ?

that is such a bizarre story .
i hope it gets resolved .
wow , who sent it to you ?
wow , you
that ##s really nice , are ya ##ll friends ?
oh i know the feeling . its good they are down to earth though
that has always bothered me as well . i mean , how much effort does it take to just wave as a thank you ?

madden is a fun game / my husband plays it a lot instead of paying attention to me .

you have a le ##mur as a pet ?
i am sorry about your situation .
what does she do that ' s so bad ?
yeah , she sounds terrible .
i don ' t blame you . i don ' t like giving out money like that - you just never know what they may do with it .
well , like i said , you couldn ' t be sure that she would use it in a good way . she could have bought alcohol , etc . . with it . what i usually do is if they are asking for money for food , i will go and buy them a meal or go get them some groceries that aren ' t per ##isha ##ble .
did you have fun at least ?
oh i ' m sorry to hear that
that ' s great ! is it a boy or a girl ?

i wouldn ' t let them borrow it . who has time for all that ?
oh my heavens , how long ago was that ?
it ' s cool that you experienced that . i love going to the movies !
oh no i ' m so sorry . i love cats
at least the cat lived a good life by your side
work is such a drag . the time we lose from it we never get back
people are just like that . our childhood is gone and we have to fen ##d for ourselves now

that ##s too far away
raising children is hard , to say the least . what did she lie about most recently ?
well that ' s a relief . it actually sounds fairly amusing !
oh no ! did you call your bank and file a fraud charge ?
at least you stopped it at $ 100 . i ' ve heard of others that have lost thousands until the bank could recover it for them .
that is such a noble gesture !
they will promote you someday , don ' t give up .
it can be scary out there alone .
that ' s too bad . i hope things turn around for you soon .
is that good or bad ?
well , as long as you ' re happy

i had a blast in high school . i wish i could go back .

i ' m sure it ' s not as bad as you think
sorry to hear that . it must make you feel very lonely

wow , did it scare you ? !
so am i , i would have freaked out if i saw it my bedroom .
i don ' t mind that - does it freak you out
but you survived .
yeah - the prices vary a lot
i ' m not sure . i think it depends on the dates you want
no , i ' ve never been there either .
i just google ##d it . it does seem beautiful online . maybe that could be next year ' s trip !
that ##s awesome
as you should
sounds like a pain ! do you know who did it ?
hm , i hope its not too costly to fixed !
that sucks ! i ' m sure it hurt your feelings .
oh , wow . i can ' t believe your friend did that to you .
i ' m sure it can be . maybe talk to him about it .
did it wake you up ? i would have been so scared .
ha ! just next time , make sure you close all the windows before going to bed !
oh no . was it a important speech ?
as king solomon in the bible would say " this will pass "
oh sad . what did happen ?
he shouldn ' t do this . is that your dog fine now ?
what was it
that ##s cool
that ' s really disgusting . i ' m sorry to hear that .

yeah . it ' s tough sometimes . but maybe taught her a valuable lesson ?
oh dear .
what type of job you looking for ?
cool
really ? that ' s awful . hopefully they understand ta ##ht you weren ' t really yourself .
don ' t be too hard on yourself . everyone makes mistakes .
sorry to hear that . were they busy or did they forget ?
you should not rely on her next time . she seems unreliable !
wow , you must have been so surprised ! your parents are so nice .
well its a nice shock ! i wish someone would give me a surprise for once !
i ' m very sorry to hear that . i ' m hear for you if you need someone .
i can understand the feeling . but being single is great that you don ' t have to constantly worry about someone else .
ha ##ha ##ha . . . iv ##e been there and i have done that . . . what kind of cookies ?
oh ##hh . . . fancy i don ##t blame you then . i would have eaten them all too
congratulations ! you must be very happy . have you met him yet ?
does he have a name ?
that sounds exciting ! will you be meeting your old friends there ?
really ? that would be pretty fun . i ' ve never heard about my high school having a reunion .
oh no that ' s horrible . did he even ask ?
that ' s awful . i ' m sorry that happened to you . maybe karma will come around on your boss .
what was in the parcel ?
that sounds delicious ! i wish someone would send me a package like that .
wow - i ' ve n ##ver been but would love to go .
definitely . and it never rains in southern california .
how come ?
i see , i feel like that sometimes too when my kids leave for college .
did he do anything ?
probably did the wrong thing . . up to no good .
excellent . how ' s it been going ?
great - i ' m glad
do you play soccer or watch it on television ?
do you have a favorite team ?
really ? what sort of package are you expecting > ?
oh that sounds like fun !
i would have been fine with that grade too . are you doing well in the class ?
i can relate to that . all that matters is you passed
that ' s very exciting . have you decided to get one for sure ?
yes , its good to be prepared . i ' m sure when you do get one , he will become a part of the family .
oh wow ! how were they ?
guess you won ' t be hungry for while
oh no - how embarrassing . what did you do ?
ph ##ew !
oh no . . is she ok ?
i hope all goes well
that ' s great ! dod you have any plans for the weekend ?
oh that ' s horrible . you can always watch a movie or something indoors .
that ##s awesome !
hard work pays off
cool ! that ' s great news . do you have any fun plans ?
sounds like fun ! i ' d love to be able to do that . but i get to work all weekend .
that is the worst . i am sorry to hear that .
those medical bills do add up . i wish we didn ##t have to pay so much to keep ourselves healthy
that is good to have new challenges .
it will be fine . switching jobs can be scary at first sometimes
well its not in your hands anymore so its best to stay calm and not worry about it now .
as it should , but a bad grade is not the end of the world .
oh wow ! i ' m really sorry to hear that . that must have been shocking . have you broken up now ?
oh i can understand the feeling . you should take some time for yourself before you try to do much else .
that is so nice .
good .
oh that ' s really disgusting ! did you still eat there ?
good . they don ' t deserve your business . you should report it to the department of health too .
sounds great
have fun !
oh i would be mad at them too ! do you know who it was ?
oh that sucks . you might be able to get the sc ##urity camera footage .
she shouldn ##t have done that without asking you . but maybe there is an opportunity here for you . . .
maybe you can experiment with other women with your wife ? could be fun
were they good memories or bad memories ?
that ' s a very strong reaction . still it must have been really pleasant for you .
oh do they scare you a lot ?
oh me too actually . they are too scary for me too
oh good luck on it ! are you studying ?
then i ' m sure you ' ll do fine . just try your hardest !
did you catch them doing it ?
i would be upset if that happened to me too .
oh no
hopefully it turns out well
you must have thanked him for it . he is a smart brother !
good on you . your brother should consider being a teacher !
yeah it can be tough to throw things out that remind us of special people . i still have some toys my grandma gave me when i was a baby .
yes i do . it can be one of the few remaining physical reminder ##s of the person .
oh that would be really frustrating . have you tried to do anything about it ?
i ' m not sure if you could train bees . you can get one of those protective suits i guess .
that is terrible . did you tried calling him ?
that is very bad person . you should forget about him .
you must be feeling so anxious , yet so excited right now !
you need to keep a cool head though , try doing some sports to relax your mind .
wow ! that ' s an amazing accomplishment ! you must be so proud of him !
that ' s really great for him . maybe he should try out for the olympics ?
that is great ! how did it turn out ?
i ' m sure it won ' t be long until your hard work is rewarded
sounds amazing ! are you going any place in particular ?
beaches are fun ! i don ' t even know the last time i ' ve been to a beach .
that could not always be a good thing
it is nice when it happens
yes that is incredibly annoying ! i ' m a quiet person by nature so that can drive me car ##zy quite fast !
yes i feel like yelling at them - but that ' s just something that i would never actually be able to do !
you must be so surprised ! technology has really advanced in the last few years .
yep , my son just got me an iphone 8 and i was surprised at how alien it was to me .
oh no , that must have been embarrassing . . . but it happens .
wow you might have gotten a little bit of trauma from it . but i ' m sure it will fade from memory eventually .
that is terrible . probably , he wanted money to buy drugs .
it could be a good explanation but he shouldn ' t have cursed .
what ! ? did they steal anything ?
that ' s no good . those windows are not che ##ep either . hopefully it won ##t cost too much .
it ' s exciting that you will be able to rec ##onne ##ct with an old friend . i understand that you ' re nervous , though !
i ' m sure once you see each other and get to chatting it will be like no time has passed ! have fun !
that must have been very scary ! did you investigate it ?
lo ##l yeah our minds can play tricks on us when we ' re nervous . i ' m glad it was nothing serious though .
get yourself some good food and watch a movie ! sometimes it ' s good to take some time for yourself
i get you , i ' ve been in your situation before
that sounds like so much fun ! i think you should . i love roller coaster ##s !
i ' ve been on so many . they ' re def ##ini ##tley worth ##while ! at least in my opinion !
i bet your chances are high . party at a friends or family ?
cool well i hope you get what you want
i ' m so sorry about that . that must have really been horrible for her . . . and you
wow that often . that must really be stress ##ful .
parties are so much fun ! are you celebrating anything special , or is the party just a get together ?
sounds like a good time ! have fun at the party !
oh good luck ! i hope you ' re able to win .
i can imagine . going through the process is very stress ##ful . do you have an attorney representing you at least ?
that is a nice surprise ! did you get charged more later ?
i wouldn ' t either . lucky day for you !
that really sucks . you can always look into new housing options .
well do you have enough room to bring in a room ##ate ?
oh no ! and you can ' t go with her ?
oh ok well she ' ll be back before you know it !
oh really ? that must have been very exciting to get !
that sounds really entertaining . i ' ve seen those fun coffee mug ##s with shapes at the bottom .
that sounds exciting ! i hope you did well .
i ' m hoping for you ! i always got stressed out waiting for grades too . despite knowing that i did well .
oh no that ' s annoying indeed .
i ' m sure they wanted to be there though . hopefully they are thinking of you .
oh no ! that ' s a terrible way to start your day . did you still go to work ?
well at least you managed to make it through the day . i probably would have just gone home .
that sounds like so much fun ! ! ! staying the night over the weekend ?
sounds even better than bc i need a bed to sleep ! lo ##l
that is always a bit embarrassing . did you blush ?
that is pretty funny , to be honest .
oh wow ! that must have been a really scary experience . what happened to the spider ?
it ' s a good thing that he was there to take care of it . i just saw a tara ##nt ##ula exhibits at the zoo . even through the windows that made me nervous .
oh no ! are you able to re ##take it ?
i ' m sorry to hear that
oh i ' m really sorry to hear that . was it a big lie ?
that ' s a pretty serious issue . you should punish him somehow .
like something out of a movie ! my god . did you nail it ?
i am sure you did !
am sorry about that , you could have reminded them per ##har ##ps
ya ##h , next time remind them earlier so you don ##t feel disturbed
wow that ' s funny !
that ' s nice . you guys can bond over it
excellent ! convey my cong ##rat ##s to her .
mo ##tiv ##ate her to participate in more competition like this .
im so sorry for your loss . did you have it long ?
you didn ##t keep it in a cage ? maybe you can get another and keep it more secure .
oh no are you planning to get another one ?
what kind of breed was it
i agree with that . every day is a new start
yes we all do . i really fell you on that
i love listening to oldies . music now isn ##t as good as it used to be ! memories right
yes they are luckily we will always have them !
lo ##l ! oh no , we ' re you able to change right away ?
at least it was water and not coffee or juice
ah that must have been nos ##tal ##gic . did you grow up with your cousin ?
i see . it ' s really good you got to catch up though !
oh really what was the ad about ?
that would be so fun i have always wanted to go but haven ##t had the time !
that ' s good to hear . did you sell the old one to help pay on the new one ?
well , at least you got a new car that doesn ' t break down .
wow ! that ' s a great achievement . you must really be proud .
that ' s great . sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her .
that could be an un ##sett ##ling situation .
i hope you had one . that is scary . are you ok ?
did you call the police ?
do you live in a house or an apartment ?
yeah that was good to helping others . it was a go ##9 ##d manner i loved it .
yeah it was quite app ##ric ##iated
do you have a topic to discuss ?
: ( fantastic . . .
i can understand that . it ' s usually either parents are happy they are out of the house , or sad that they ' re gone . i ' m sorry you feel lonely .
i can understand that . kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void . hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it .
yes it is . my youngest has been away all this week for his first summer camp . it ' s been both awesome and lonely .
oh wow ! what did you do ?
thank goodness for that !
so then what did you do ?
yeah that ' s pretty crap ##py for sure !
oh no ! hopefully there isn ' t a mess to clean up when you get back .
maybe next time you will remember ! ha ##ha .
oh no ! when i mis ##pl ##ace things , i try to re ##tra ##ce my steps . have you tried that ?
uh oh . . . i have a cat who likes to steal things too lo ##l try checking underneath the furniture .
that must be fun for them . our neighbor hood only has older people so my kids stay around the house .
see and i would have though the opposite , but i suppose if they are gone all the time it might get over ##don ##e .
yeah , i can see that being an issue . i guess your not as lucky as i was first initially thinking . im like you a home body .
that is crazy ! he must have got a loan .
he probably won ' t be able to ! time will tell .
what kind of problems ?
you mean torture ##s ?
it was good habit i like it
that was really bad
did you try to help them ?
there is nothing you can do then .
is that a prince album ?
well give it back : ) stealing is not right
what happened ? did you uncle drove over the speed limit ?
that is horrible . he could have even crashed the car by being drunk . how could you let him drive
oh that is quite strange , i hope nothing has happened to them .
ye ##a , i would find that rude as well , if he cares about the relationship he should apologize or make it up .
what airplane ? did you know someone on it ?
that is really sad . where was it at ?
what kind of car did you buy ?
did you get an insurance check ?
oh no ! that ' s a tough change , but i suppose you ' ll have to try to join clubs and make new ones !
it ' s harder as an adult , but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation . or , if you have a neighborhood club , joining that !
when will you show your boss the design ?
that is a smart move by you .
that ' s really impressive ! what do you like about it ?
that does sound really exciting .
that ##s just the best , i have to plan one of these this fall with my wife
i understand , it feels good but when you are away you keep thinking about home and the kids lo ##l
that ' s strange . did you ?
did he walk away afterwards ?
why ?
yeah i understand
oh god . . well i hope she left you and you ' ve learned that no one likes a betray ##er
that / s disturbing kidd ##o . . you lied and betrayed then you left . you have much to learn about life and how to treat others
oh cool , what was the research about ?
that ' s interesting , i ' m not sure i even knew there were different types of caf ##fe ##ine . is one type worse than the others ?
how long have you been with your boyfriend ?
that ' s a long time , so sorry to hear about your troubles .
wow so close to being out on her own are you a bit nervous ?
very sad but think of how proud she is going to make you in the good she will be just fine .
why do you say that ?
that is so true . i feel the same way . it ' s just nice to know that you work hard for your money .
i have been slack ##ing but that ##s only because i moved , i have to start back up
they are offering a free pass at my gym might take it up
it must be nice to have a house
i am sure it does
are you ok ?
i bet . that always happens to me . at least its gone now for you
really ?
so sorry about that
your child ?
you are excited about this or ? ?
why do you say that ?
i am sorry to hear that . i hope things get better for you
i completely understand ! they scare me and i become like a little girl ! the rat snakes are great though . . . i would never hurt them . . but i don ' t want them near me or in eye vision ! lo ##l
lo ##l ! om ##g . . i use that word , i didn ' t think anyone else did ! that is the perfect word for it . i saw a tara ##nt ##ula in the pet store the other day and my skin jumped off of me
wow so happy you got it all done , must feel nice right
that does sound like a lot of stuff going on at once
oh i bet . was it your first grand ##child ?
what a great day that must have been for you .
what will you do on vacation ?
will you stay in a condo on the beach ?
that sounds so relaxing ! you ' ll probably sleep great .
that is awesome what was the play about did kids perform ?
i heard of hamlet that ' s the one about the prince right i would enjoy to see that being played out in the future glad you enjoyed it .
yes , the cable company is in ##fur ##iating . do they eventually help you though ?
that ' s awful . that definitely is the worst . maybe it ' s time to change companies .
i am sorry about that . what kind of keys ?
oh wow ! that stink ##s . at least you got new keys
nos ##tal ##gic feelings can be nice ! i hope you didn ' t feel sad
that ' s great ! have you moved out of state ?
that would ann ##oy me so much . can you take it up with management ?
what a tough situation . just make sure and document everything .
what a great accomplishment ! i can understand why you ' d be happy about that .
you should be really proud of that .
what happen , did he make it ?
damn that sucks [UNK]
oh wow , why would she think you stole the money ?
would she have any reason not to trust you ? i would assume you have not done anything like this before .
oh god that is horrible ! look in too bitter apr ##ico ##t and also ch ##lore ##lla if she does radiation . . both have research done on them to help a lot with cancer .
i can imagine ! i have been through it with others . it is terrifying !
could you purchase one from a local store ?
i see , online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or don ' t work it becomes an issue .
a race with running or with cars ?
as long as you trained hard and did your best , that is what counts !
oh no ! have you had any luck ?
that must be so scary . i ' m really glad you have some good options to try .
well hopefully you are a guy ? i know how you feel , it feels great to lose weight !
how much weight did you lose ? i have lost over 100 ##lb before . does feel awesome
which rest ##aran ##t
oh i thought you were eating out
did your boss understand at least ?
that ' s true . i would be mad about that as well
i ' m sorry to hear that . have you had your cat a long time ?
i bet it has . they become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go
did you invite him ?
wow ! i bet you had a good time though at your party
will it start you think
i pay 34 but they are pro ##s
i feel you there ! i have two broken ones in my driveway ! what kind of car did you get ?
a new car is a new car : ) just make sure to get it tune ups and oil changes etc on time
i am so sorry about that . how are you holding up ?
i bet that ##s rough . i would be the same way if my dog died .
who ##ops , guess you were em ##bara ##ssed .
have you been back since ?
maybe she is getting older , mines a little gr ##ump ##y as well but i accept it
that ' s not too bad , maybe she needs more attention from you
try your local pawn shop for a cheap one you don ' t want a messy looking yard .
that is crazy maybe you should check offer up and that is crazy i dislike when people steal what is yours especially something you really need .
how did that go ?
that ' s great to hear ! i am happy for you
that was very nice of them , you must have worked hard to get that .
well , sometimes just following orders really well is enough to impress your superiors .
so annoying . where were their parents ?
what a pain in the you know what . i wish the parents could be punished too . ha ##ha
keep your head up and keep applying to other companies , something will come around for you .
it is , but you have got to keep grinding .
where are you vacation ##ing
om ##g my dream vacation
what were your favorite movies he did ?
that is a favorite of mine too ! he was so good in it .
oh . . take it back to them . . i have had so many take mine and it ' s not cool
that ##s sick ##ening . don ' t steal stuff or you deserve anytime you get stolen from
are you kicking them out for a valid reason ?
just make it short and sweet .
did you get into any trouble over it ?
did they get into trouble over it ?
i would be the same way . did the snake attack you ?
well , that ##s ok . did you kill it ?
not my favorite time of the year
when i was a kid the adults use to scare me so since then i have not been a fan but i will take my kids trick ##er treating
that is horrible
it was just a tire he could ##ve let it go .
i don ' t ko ##w anything about that . what happened ?
that ' s terrible . i had no idea
i see . i used to play this game along with battlefield in the past when in college . now , i only fifa only , others do not interest me much
good old days of playing these games all nights with my roommate ##s . now adult life is so different and boring
wow , how that happened ?
that is terrible . what did you do then ?
have you seen doctor
make sure you get them done
the lovely leaves fall from the trees .
yeah it really is
where are you heading
just keep your money close to you and your passport closer
its getting real old to see the teams who have the most money keep winning .
something has to change . its very annoying .
they ' ve just let me down one two many times .
it ' s really a long story , but i won ' t be going back .
okay , but i ' m pretty sure we aren ' t done yet .
oh really ? it ' s pretty hot where i live .
oh wow ! that is surprising
where are you heading to
i wish i was you
same here . sundays are so much better with nfl .
and this heat can go away too .
well , at least you passed . you ' re both on equal ground now .
that ' s great , it ' ll pay off for her over time .
it is frustrating to work with such people . they should be fired instead of keeping them there
see . they will only hind ##er the overall performance . you should talk to your manager
i am sorry to hear that . their is always next time .
i know . i always get that feeling when i don ' t win the lottery .
really already ! ? wow . . what year for you ?
everything new is always scary . i am sure you are going to do great ! good luck !
oh no , did you file a police report ?
that is good , glad it will get taken care of
you have an amazing friend !
well that ' s awesome ! i bet you will have a great time
i ' m not too sure about it really , but the candy ' s good ! what is it you like about it ?
aw ##w ##w , that ' s precious ! perhaps if i had kids it would be different . they must get so excited about dressing up and going out !
that ##s excellent news how reward ##ing !
im happy for you !
was that an issue for some reason ?
oh , okay . well then it was a nice surprise .
that can definitely get ag ##gra ##vating ! it always seems to happen at the worst time .
i understand , maybe you can set up certain times or something
i bet you are excited
haven ##t seen her for a while ?
amazing ! how old is he ?
adorable so happy for you !
we get really busy in the fall with a lot of extra ##cu ##rricular stuff .
i see , well hang in there . in about 5 minutes , they ' ll be older .
i love the cool breeze ##s of fall
we spend more time outside in fall than summer . summer is way too hot
i don ' t even know what that is lo ##l
sounds neat . do you usually cook korean dishes ?
oh man . are they still ok ?
that sucks . must hurt throwing all that away .
now is the time the real growing up starts
oh boy
oh , i would have screamed and ran . i hate snakes so much !
i don ' t care what kind it is . i will stay far away from them .
so am i ! do you have plans ?
that sounds good . i hope you get re - en ##er ##gi ##zed .
maybe she will be .
okay , then run for the hills .
wow ! that ' s quite the milestone ! any plans to retire ?
may as well keep going if you ' re healthy .
sounds like you ' re burned out . where ya going ?
the beach is awesome when the weather is good . hope you have fun !
i know how that feels . did everything turn up ok ?
could be worse right ? glad everything ended up being ok .
what was she hiding ?
that was probably us when we were little lo ##l , my little niece ##s are the same way and they are such bad actors too
will you have enough time ?
i hope so . it feels good when your day goes smoothly
that ' s terrible can you reprint them
that sucks
same here . i can sometimes remember where i was the first time iv ##e seen some to .
some have aged really well though .
seems to be the norm these days all ##over the country
i get here nearly ever ##day ( or ##l )
i miss that too ! i am always telling everyone to get off their phones and be present .
it is and it won ##t change not even in my house
it could come in useful but how often though ? is it worth it ?
you never know until you try or you can also do those online courses
i hear ya . i hate it when people check their phones when i ' m trying to talk to them .
i know what you mean .
i bet that was a great time .
that is so cool to have those memories .
that ' s exciting ! i hope everything will go good . just be you and i ' m sure they will love you
/ i love your confidence !
ye ##a he did some foul things to those people .
i am glad someone stepped up and spoke out about .
why is that
is he a nice person the manager ?
well , that ' s good . did she borrow money from you ?
perhaps she ' s turned over a new leaf . it ' s very good of you to lend her money , even if she is your sister .
it ' s surprising how people suddenly wake up and realize that perhaps they haven ' t been acting as perhaps they should have .
good ! plan and spend the money as you wish !
nice ! wish you get more bonus in upcoming months .
well i hope she gets in soon and you guys have a good time together !
well that sounds fun ! hope she has a good flight !
i hate other drivers . it seems like they are getting worse every day . did you hon ##k at them or anything ?
i would be too . i ' m happy you didn ##t get into an accident or even worse , killed !
oh man . must be feeling pretty guilty by now .
just try and be better prepared next time so you don ##t get tempted again .
that ' s really good . where are you flying to ?
nice ! texas is really nice this time of year .
that ##s great news . did you have to study or is this an area you are already familiar with ?
awesome , good luck on your test ! i hope it all goes well !
i love cooking . what did you prepare ?
that is tri ##via . when i am h ##ype ##d , i cook las ##ag ##na . i know that is hard to cook , but i mastered it all on my own
that is good , did you like your watch ?
does it have some cool features ?
what is the painting of ? it sounds lovely !
which city was it ?
i ' m sorry someone passed away . did you find a good photo to represent that person ?
that ##s very sweet of her . i ' m sure it was nice , although sad , looking back at those memories .
congratulations ! does it come with a raise ?
wo ##ah , that ' s incredible ! you deserved it : )
that ' s a long time to be away . are you going by yourself ?
the opportunity probably won ' t come along to many times in a lifetime . you should take advantage of it and enjoy yourself as much as you can .
you don ' t have friends at work ?
no partner at home either ? work stuff can be really dt ##ress ##ful
good for you . are you really close to this friend ? i wish i had more close friends
i am also single and there is no one to take me out just to soothe my inner emotional turmoil
that sucks . did he admit to doing it ?
yeah that ' s true . i don ' t let people borrow my car anymore . too big of an investment
congratulations on that . hope you have landed the job ? did you ?
what company have you applied to ? is it a big player in the industry it operates ?
will there be a next time ?
i ' m sorry to hear it went this way for you .
that ' s a good idea . there ' s a lot of preparation that goes into a good trip .
so true . i hate it when that happens .
no , but we are going on a cruise to co ##zu ##mel next spring break and i think that would be so much fun . have you ever been ?
that sounds amazing ! i bet it was so much fun !
what is your budget ?
you could buy a trailer ?
cong ##rat ##s ! you must have taught her well : )
yu ##m , sounds amazing !
oh boy , how did it go ?
cong ##rat ##s , that ' s a real accomplishment !
that ' s awesome , glad to hear , what are you most happy with ?
a solid and happy family life is the key to a happy life !
yes , i hear you on that one .
going swimming on sunday , relaxing and maybe grocery shopping on saturday .
om ##g i know ! it ' s impossible to sleep : ( i ' m sorry that happened to you .
those sc ##ound ##rel ##s ! how can they get away with that ?
that ' s a nice surprise ! when was the last time you saw him ?
aw , that ' s awesome , i hope you two have a good time together !
that ' s great ! keep it up . weight loss is tough
ha ##ha yu ##p diet ##ing is hard . all i want to do is eat delicious stuff all the time
wo ##ah that ' s nuts ! have you called to complain ?
that ' s ridiculous ! can you switch ?
that ' s awesome , i ' m with you , i always wished i continued to learn to play the guitar . it ' s always a nice skill to have .
hey , it ' s never too late to start up again . you can always do it as a hobby !
ha ##ha , right on . it ' s nice when they become a little more self - aware and develop parts of the brain that help them realize it ' s not all about them , and that it ' s good to be self ##less .
that ' s the sign of a good parent . you ' re re ##ap ##ing what you so ##wed , in a good way . hopefully it carries on when he ' s an adult and he becomes another good human being that we have few of
oh no ! can you do some gig economy work online to try to make enough ?
wo ##ah that ' s awful , those things are such a rip off !
did they help you ?
i ' m glad things worked out for you .
oh yeah ? why is that ?
that ' s awesome ! what instruments do they play ?
oh , that sounds ta ##sty have you eaten it yet ?
i know the feeling , it ' s too good to stop .
that ' s nice . i was never too good at spelling
that ' s even better . he will be correct ##ing you soon lo ##l
i lost a cat before . its a lot to deal with .
it get better with time .
oh wow that ##s quite a while
oh dan ##g iv ##e never really been in that situation before
wow that is em ##bara ##ssing for them ! maybe they had a crazy night and had no time to shower ?
oh go ##sh that is awful ! sounds like depression !
that sounds great ! you must have felt really happy !
it sounds like you were quite content and joy ##ful with you time you had with your daughter .
you don ' t like this dog ?
oh yes , i completely understand that . just get some snacks and watch a lot of movies : )
ou ##ch ! are you okay ?
i ' m so sorry !
aw ##w ##w what ' s wrong ? maybe going to the lake will cheer you up ?
that is a bum ##mer ! well , you can go next time !
you sound like me a few weeks ago with my relatives , since they have a bunch of kids under the age of 10 . sorry to hear you ' re going through the same stress .
yeah , even if they ' re not being annoying or bad . . . just so many people at once and all that activity . . too much . love to see them come , and love it even more to watch them go .
i had some one tip me a $ 25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locke ##t . i cried lo ##l
serving tables is hard . some days you can work your hardest and make absolutely nothing . i had to quit after so many years
do tell ! what upgrades have you given it ?
oh that ' s nice . what color did you change it to ?
that ' s a great color
i haven ##t done that in ages . how did you do ?
just gonna have to work harder for next time .
that sucks , if it had been in the coffee shop maybe it could have been replaced .
they have these new portable cup holders that attach to almost anything . maybe that can help in the future .
i can ' t wait til i make it that far ,
i am only a so ##ph ##more
are you happy or sad about moving ?
well , i hope you have a good experience in your new city and raise an amazing family !
oh , man ! that is horrible ! what can you do about it ?
if you can ' t , it may throw you off by a whole semester ! i would be really mad if i were you !
nice ! always good to be prepared , makes things a lot less stress ##ful if there is one .
florida gets hit a lot ! smart move being ready , but i hope you stay safe regardless !
what are you doing to improve your self ?
so you ' re improving your self by getting married ?
oh my god , so sad . how did that happen . feel so sorry for you
sorry for your loss
good job , it ' s always good to hit the gym and to stay in shape . i just started again as well .
just keep at it and i ' ll do the same ! we will be shredded in no time !
that ' s a good effective walk !
yeah i get that . i don ' t go outside for long periods of time .
that ' s too bad . don ' t give up though
there will be something you like
you must be so proud of her .
that is great to hear . sounds like she has good head on her shoulder .
cong ##rat ##s ! what will your new position be ?
that ' s amazing ! : )
i ' m jealous of you . i ' ve had a roommate the past few years since i ' m in college . first one i had battle depression and mental illness , and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal . this recent roommate seems normal enough though .
i ' m glad to hear it . at least you know you ' re good at being social in some ways . maybe you can make friends outside of roommate ##s , and then be able to be social outside of your apartment and be able to come home and have the peace and quiet .
hopefully it is just a sp ##rain . might not need to receive medical attention .
ou ##ch man . just keep it on ice for the evening and re ##asse ##ss in the morning .
i ' m sorry to hear that . have you called it ?
maybe its time for a new printer ?
that sounds fun . what are you most excited about ?
i ' ve never been dove hunting . it sounds interesting .
uh oh , whose vase did you break ?
ah man , that ' s a bum ##mer , hopefully she isn ' t too mad and will forgive you !
what job did he get ?
that ' s amazing , did he get a job at google ?
fun friends and good food . who is your team ?
boom ##er sooner !
ah , that ' s awesome , it ' s always a joy to see a new born baby experiencing it ' s first view of the world !
how old are your kidd ##os now ?
that must be nice . you can focus more on enjoying yourself while away .
that is awesome . they must really like you .
congratulations ! that is great , definitely will help your gp ##a . plan on doing the same this semester ?
that ' s the way to do it , you will be thankful you did in the long run !
aw , are they not anymore ?
lo ##l ! i hear that : )
that ' s incredibly sweet . that ' s like the best birthday gift too , since it probably tasted really good , but then showed your time and effort all in one . i heard once to make them taste like a professional made it , you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something
damn . . hope when i have kids that they ' re like you . that all sounds great . you ' ll probably make all of his friends jealous
oh my go ##sh that ' s disgusting ! ! ! i hate when there are flying things buzzing around soo annoying
seriously . i wonder where those babies would have been laid ? you probably saved someone ' s lunch from being a birth ##ing suite .
did you get a nice prize for it ?
that ' s amazing , how many people entered ?
huge win , do you plan on entering again next year ?
maybe if there ' s a hot dog one i can enter it too .
cong ##rad ##ulation ##s you must be very proud of her ! what is her degree in ?
i think that ' s great to hear . does she already have an art gallery started ?
i would love to but we can ' t share images on here : (
i enjoy watching art . maybe i ' ll ha ##pen across some of it !
what kind of lunch ##es do you like to pack for them ?
finger ##fo ##ods are always good kid lunch ##es . and i hate having to go to the dan ##g grocery store !
lo ##l ! that is hilarious . i hope you got it on video
om ##g . i love your mom lo ##l
that ' s never a fun thing to do
do you know what kind it was ?
what job did you interview for ?
that ' s amazing , you must be so excited right now
whoa . what happened ?
oh that is devastating . i hope insurance covers .
i believe there are things in life that are ir ##re ##pl ##ace ##able and price ##less ! there is no amount of money that can give you the true value of your grandfather ' s watch . i think you should pass it down to your grandchildren .
i consider this a family heir ##lo ##om and your children would be happy to share this story for years to come .
wow ! that is amazing ! i guess a little tough instruction and training has paid off ! no need to worry then .
that ' s fantastic . it sounds like she has tapped into her inner musical talent !
what is going to happen ?
oh boy , have a great time !
e ##w , what did you do ?
aw , that ' s disappointing !
wow , that ' s unfortunate . sorry to hear . were you close ?
i hope you are finding ways to cope with your loss . that can ' t be easy to deal with .
i hope that helps you and that you find peace .
i ' m guessing she didn ##t ask to use them ? has she taken them in the past ?
that would be very frustrating . hopefully she will learn to replace things as she gets older !
you worked hard , what are you studying in school ?
i believe you can do it , what do you hope to get a job doing after ?
amazing . i bet that was awesome . do you play yourself ?
i bet you were having a great time .
ye ##a that is really far . give it some time and i am sure you will meet some new people .
it takes time to adapt to a new city . get involved in some groups to meet like minded people .
oh , good luck on it ! what are you applying for ?
that ' s a great attitude to have going in . they really pick up on confidence at interviews .
aw , that is really cute of your cat to do .
it ' s good to have a pet in your life , makes you happy .
why not ? i love chicken !
oh no ! maybe the restaurant you ate from wasn ' t clean ?
its sad . how many rescues do you have ?
well i appreciate you .
i want to rescue but i have to wait until i move . no pets allowed here
oh no ! how old was he ?
what type of dog was he ?
that ' s gross . did you make the sandwich yourself or buy it from a restaurant ?
nasty . that makes me want to not eat there anymore , but i guess it happens sometimes .
i hope you got a ref ##und .
that is just the worst , who made fun of you ?
that ' s so disappointing . people should really not be judging others when they don ' t know how much effort was put in to the outfit .
hi are you still here ?
it did , what were we talking about again ?
i can understand that . i lost my dog a few years ago . what ' s worse is i wasn ' t around when it happened - - i was out of the state . i hope you at least got to say goodbye .
man . . i ' m so sorry . i remember when i was really young , i was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbor ' s cat driving home . they just ran right out into the street . she drove home and cried for a while .
who knows . they could have been like my mom , and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything . might not have noticed , either . or they were just bad people . hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you can ' t get answers to .
. . . then what ?
aw , wonderful !
well that ' s good ! what did you all do ?
we do something similar at our thanksgiving ##s . did you make a home - cooked meal ?
what sorts of pie did yo um ##ake ?
we haven ' t really done pie ##s in a while , but my grandma makes a chocolate roll and my mom makes some awesome pumpkin bars . do you roast your turkey ? we use a turkey fry ##er for ours .
that sounds pretty awesome . what did you guys grill ? was she over for a special occasion at all ?
i agree . i had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet . i really preferred that over a stranger . it sounds like you both had an awesome night !
cool
i bet . i miss my friends
that ' s good to hear . how old is she ?
hey , you can go out and not pay a baby ##sit ##ter .
that ' s good . were you nervous at first ?
well that ' s nice that you all get along . you ar actually pretty lucky
hmm . . what ' s that mean ? do you feel like you did something wrong ?
ah , i see . yeah , that ' s an easy habit to have . i would be that way too if i wasn ' t too cheap to spend money . i just try to do a lot of cr ##oc - pot stuff since i stink at cooking and am poor
oh no ! did you study ?
lo ##l ! english is a tough subject .
that is a very big problem to me ! however , if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right ?
well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year . with that in mind i hope you have more than one bathroom . i suggest you let him keep his po ##op in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him !
dan ##g , that sounds too good to be true . if you ' re 100 % sure that it ' s not a sc ##am , and then 100 % sure again that it ' s definitely not a sc ##am ( please really really check in every way possible ) , then i ' m happy for you !
w ##ha ##aa ##t ! that was cool of them . if it were me , it ' d be torture trying to figure out what to do . put it into stocks ? savings ? pay off debt ? go on a vacation ? i hate making decisions cause i feel like i messed up no matter what i choose . but maybe you deserve a vacation , eh
cong ##rat ##s . you are lucky
really ? wow
that ' s fun , do you think you will enjoy it ?
uh oh , well at least you won ' t be a lone when you watch a scary movie .
what was she doing ?
oh ##hh wow . i hope you were successful !
what did you get in the mail ?
that is awful , did you miss some payments ?
what ##s the reason ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , how is he feeling now ?
nice ! ! ! when are you planning on going ?
that ' s so close . have you gone jet skiing on that lake before ?
i know that feeling ! i have 2 dogs and 1 cat . love them to death .
yeah ! and they are so excited to see you and welcome you home !
why has it taken so long ?
sorry . . when i first read what you said i read it as grandparents . . i don ' t know why . my brain is tired from work .
oh no , how did you end up in that situation .
ha ##ha , that ' s awesome , at least you two made it out of it safely .
i would have been so excited lo ##l . what did it look like ? !
was anyone with you ? did anyone believe you ?
that ##s awesome though . i didn ' t graduate until i was 40 something
that really is quite an accomplishment . . the type that makes you cry at graduation ceremonies !
that ' s very sweet . i was just dog - sitting my neighbor ' s dogs last week . they were a little annoying at first , but i had to watch and stay with them the whole week , and i really grew to like them . they felt like my little sisters i had to take care of and play with
right , yeah , you just get used to their presence . i hated that they ' d bark so much at thunder ##storm ##s , but other than that , their little qui ##rks were growing on me . in fact , i miss them right now
have you been drinking more water lately ? or it ' s just happening for no reason ?
that would be a good idea , it ' s better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious !
oh my ! you must have been pretty embarrassed . did someone bring you gas ?
i ' m sure its happened to him before and understands .
awesome ! how was that ? do you think she will enjoy high school ?
i know that feeling , i ' m waiting for the college to start myself !
aw ##w , that ' s so sad . i ' m sure she would have wanted ya ' ll to keep having fun times together .
yes , it ' s good to keep bonding . i understand not being able to do it at first , though
oh , man , mine too ! it ' s so annoying .
sure does . i think they get a little jealous and just want our attention . they ' re also very curious about the world , which is a good thing !
is there not an upgraded version ?
oh . i know what you mean . i am like that with shoes . i always change my phone
i would have though that your crystal ball would have fore ##war ##ned you ? ; )
did you keep your receipt ? maybe you can exchange it or get your money back ? ; ) lo ##l
i feel your pain totally . i take an online class and i am a teacher at a new school this year
fun times ! makes you think back to being in hs . i am working in a hs this time .
nice ! i hate looking for apartments . i ' m in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years . it gets really old after a while , since i ' m on a budget and it ' s hard to find something cheap but not a rat ' s nest . glad you found what you wanted .
i live right next to my campus too ! the downs ##ide is it ' s a building made in the ' 50 ##s and looks terrible on the inside . but i can bear it since i ' m saving money . most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fan ##cier place because they don ' t care about money .
i hate that ! knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep . i would have done the same thing .
ha ##ha , while he builds back up his spider web .
l ##ma ##o . lo ##lo ##l . i pay 600 a month . you ?
see it can get worse ! lo ##l . . . i am paying cash for my classes now but i only take 1 at a time .
that ' s sad , well , happy birthday !
i sort of feel the same way , the older i get , the less i care about my birthday .
ah , so are you feeling pretty lonely ? that ' s interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip , but who am i to judge ! could be viewed as kind of cool that he ' s that close with the dog .
yeah , he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company , but some protection , too . but i don ' t know all of the situation so i guess i shouldn ' t say for sure ! hopefully it ' s not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio
aw , you shouldn ' t feel bad ! at some point you ' ll have more cash and do the treating . there ' s a lot of give and take in relationships .
i totally get it . i bet you think about it way more than she does , though i don ' t know if that makes you feel any better lo ##l
what restaurant is it ?
what kind of food do they make ? sorry to hear that ! that ' s awful .
maybe they could get funding from the municipality .
marked what wrong ?
did you speak with him ?
oh . well he will probably fix it when he gets better
i can imagine
wow , congratulations ! that is a really cool endeavor !
sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward .
i ' m sorry to hear that . hopefully after this project you can get some time off to spend with your family .
i ' m sure your family will understand . and look at the bright side , you ' ll cher ##ish your next visit even more .
that is always a good thing . is it free or a toll road ? where i live most of em cost money .
that ##s awesome . saves time and money .
nice ! school is starting next week for me also , hopefully we both have a good school year !
is this your first year working this job ? if so , hope it goes well !
she is most certainly going to enjoy that !
no special occasion then ?
ya ##y ! is it her first year or just excited to get some free time ?
oh wow , she ' s must be smart ! but yeah , that must be stress ##ful .
interesting . what is your presentation about ?
that ' s so cool ! is it like a best friend for someone who may be lonely ?
oh that sucks , i would hon ##k harder at him
yeah , some cities have a lot of people and some really bad drivers . they ' re rude and di ##sr ##ep ##ect ##ful to all other people even pedestrians .
i hope you good ##lu ##ck in the future
one day when you are successful , i hope you pass your good luck forward !
oh that ' s terrible ! if you don ' t mind me asking ; who and why ?
maybe he is trying to do what he thinks is best . i ' m sure it ' s out of love not just being mean .
why did you do that ?
so he was ok with it ? or ?
om ##g i am so jealous i love fishing . where are you going ?
fun times ! i did a little beach fishing not long ago at new sm ##yr ##na . i hope you catch some cool fish !
have fun for me !
oh , bless her heart . i hope you are nice to her .
that ' s really nice of you for being nice to her . i bet she is happy that you are her co - worker .
oh , well that ' s terrible ! hopefully , your husband was okay and nobody else was hurt . but , it ' s awful that anyone was .
yes , there are many times the emotional pain from tragic events are worse than physical . it doesn ' t make it easier that it was a person you knew , i ' m sure .
cong ##rat ##s ! what class ?
you deserve to be happy about that , that is not an easy class !
that ' s going to be a pain to fix yourself !
that was really shady of them to do that , wonder why they did ?
that ##s awesome , i have not purchased cds in ages lo ##l
i bet that brought back a lot of wonderful memories , from the good old days
when doe sit come out in theatres ?
oh i got you , what system is it going out on ?
oh no , i hope you was paying attention to what was around you .
that is really scary when you are alone .
oh my go ##sh , what a place to break down ! i was born in n ##d and i know the dark you are talking about . were you stuck for long ?
oh yeah , of course . i heard they are rampant up in those parts . did they keep you long ?
i hope they returned you with all your bits and parts . it would be alarm ##ing to find they borrow ##ers from you later !
oh man true ##r words were never spoken ! how are you gonna spend your free time this weekend ?
that ' s my thought process like every week . i think i might be getting old because sometimes i like sleeping more than being awake .
oh no ! all that work for nothing
did it at least taste good ? lo ##l
that is good that he had an air compressor . low tires seem to be the story of my life . i seem to always have to be airing up a tire .
they are very handy to have . we got a box that airs up tires and has jumper cables also .
they work really great . well worth the extra dollars .
awesome . is she going to university after ?
that ' s great to hear . she ' ll be flying out of the nest before you know it .
that ' s awesome ! not too many are able to do that !
awesome . i ' m glad that she has things going for her , and congratulations to you !
what type of food do you miss most ?
it sounds like you might be from down south . i would miss it there , too .
what ? ! are you sick or your family member ?
oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that , it must have been hard on you
how exciting ! who did you order from that gave you such good service ?
i would order again also , that ' s a good company .
that ' s great ! i went a few months ago and really enjoyed it
i hope you have lots of fun !
wow that ' s great your are so lucky to see it
how exciting ! is that your going to be your first time visiting ?
i hope you have a good time there . be careful in the interior , it ' s hot as heck there .
aw , was she stressed out ?
aw , that ' s no fun . i bet the constant construction didn ' t help at all
oh wow ! my dog passed away recently too so i can relate to your pain . i am so sorry for your loss
most define ##tly she was my constant companion . it will hopefully get easier for us each day
why do you feel that way ? has he enacted any policies that directly affect you or anyone you know ? for the record - i ' m not too fond of him either , just curious more than anything .
i agree that he has said some things to suggest that . however , i do think he has done some good and wouldn ##t necessarily be the worst president we have ever had .
that is very thoughtful . happy birthday ! what did you get from your partner ?
wow ! now that ' s one cool gift if i may say so myself .
what did it say ?
wow , was it ?
that ' s awesome . have you been going to school for a while or is this for first semester .
awesome . its great . helps keep down the student loans .
yes , mechanical engineering .
math and science is my strong suite .
what did you have in there ?
i love ve ##gg ##ies , do you know who did it ?
that ' s mean of them , they better give it back to you .
i ' d still sc ##orn them for their actions .
what ' s your favorite holiday ?
i love that pie ! ! ! it ' s delicious ! my favorite holiday is christmas .
that ' s good ! i think a lot of older people are pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic about the future , but i grew up on technology and am excited to see what new stuff comes out .
i think we need more people like you in society .
that ' s smart . you don ' t want to forget anything . are you planning a trip soon ?
what a relief , right ? where are you going ?
i did too . graduated high school in 85
well , that ' s different then .
pit stops can be fun . how did you do on the scratch off ?
no way ! cong ##rat ##s ! ! ! i ' ve never come close to that much on a scratch off . i bet your heart was racing .
ha ##ha ##ha , that sounds like fun
that ' s great ! i like to go dancing too
what type of work do you do ?
you must be getting a big pay raise you ole banker .
i hate when that happens . did they end up ap ##olo ##gizing at all or did they play it off like nothing happened ?
i would be too . its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time !
that ' s no good , how did you break it ?
no good , are you going to get another one ?
i ' d buy it off you after it ' s fixed , i love tag he ##uer .
i wouldn ' t maybe i could get some recommendations for a nice one ?
which chemistry class are you taking ?
yi ##kes . organic chemistry was the last chemistry class i took . yu ##ck reaction mechanisms . . . s ##n ##1 s ##n ##2 etc .
yeah i wasn ' t a huge fan of the class .
depends on what way you ' re talking about maybe physics 1 or maybe cal ##c ii . that ##s where things really started to come together for how things work + the math to understand how things work .
what are your favorite parts about your childhood ?
that sounds like a lot of fun . did you do this with friends and family or alone ?
i hope it goes well ! are you worried ?
then everything should go fine ! good luck , i hope you get a raise !
do you have a lot of experience baking cakes ?
sounds like fun . are you excited ?
oh wow i have never been either . try not to be nervous ! who are you going with ?
well i am sure you will have fun . just follow the instructors lead !
that ' s too bad , did they fit your style ?
well you saved some money at least ?
how come you had to cheat on the quiz ?
what did you end up making on the t est ?
where are you guys going ?
that ' s awesome what a sweet boyfriend , how old are you turning ?
happy birthday ! you must be excited
my favorite team used to the bruins , but then i moved
did you sit close to the ice ?
amazing , i love char ##a
well , that was absolutely terrible ! he certainly picked the worse time to do it . you ' re right , he was a jerk !
oh , well i ' m sorry , that is definitely an unpleasant valentine ' s day . but , on the positive side , at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed .
that ##s awesome ! i bet you were really excited !
you should go out and celebrate
maybe its time to ins ##till a little discipline .
how old are your children ?
do you think you ' ll be next ?
they ' d shut down then .
have you been through many hurricanes ? we stock up in case a tornado takes out the power .
i ' ve been through quite a few tornadoes . i live in missouri , but before that i lived in kansas . have you ever had to use your supplies ?
yi ##kes ! so far we haven ' t had to dig into the water or food . i do debate on getting a generator though .
aw that ' s so sweet . did you find one to make ?
sound interesting ! it ' s a cookie or is it cake - like ?
oh that must be hard . are you guys really close
man i know how that feels . when i go to visit my sister and niece ##s , i have such a hard time when its time to fly home
you have done such a great job ! you should be proud of yourself and not be afraid to do so .
don ' t be ashamed or set yourself short es ##pc ##ial ##ly since you worked so hard . if you feel scared or hesitant to do so than i would talk to her boss to possibly set up a meeting .
what sport are you talking about ?
i really do not like hockey , it is boring as hell
how come you ' re so angry ?
that is no good at all , how come you did that ?
well , i ' m sure you are super nervous ! of course , i have no doubt all will be well and a new experience for you !
yes , and worse case , perhaps you can carry something on board to help relax your nerves , just in case . there ' s always alcohol too !
are you excited ?
do you know if you ' re having a boy or girl yet ?
i hope it ' s a boy i love kids .
got to get him playing some sports for sure .
that sucks . did she say why ?
wow that ' s harsh .
find a new girlfriend . that ship has sailed . if you ' re really still want her consider trying to play the jealousy card . ( ie ; make her jealous )
you don ' t even have to do that . keep it class ##y . just show up with a pretty girl and have a good time and be a perfect gentleman . don ##t even bat an eye at her .
that ' s great ! how old are your kids ?
that ' s really when they start to come into their own . must be really neat !
can you send it back for an exchange ?
we all make mistakes , just send it back and have it the way you want it .
that ' s good you have someone that you can talk to about your problems and feelings . i ' m sure it helps !
it can be hard to find the right therapist , so it ' s great you have found one that really is there for you and helps .
i am sorry you have had a difficult time . what is ep ?
i am so happy you have someone so special in your life !
that ' s great ! is your position changing ?
oh more money is always good
i ' m sure they ' ll be delicious .
i ' m glad they came in for you .
well , work can be stress ##ful for many and do that . often , we can bring it home with us .
that would be very disappointing and frustrating i ' m sure . no doubt you wonder why they would do such a thing !
im sorry to hear that . how are you going ?
that ##s true . just remember that as much as it might sting now there are plenty of people out there and you want to find one that makes you happy all of the time , not just some of the time .
man that is really hard . i can relate however b / c my sweet riley ( dog ) just had to be put to sleep due to cong ##est ##ive heart failure
it doesn ' t . try hard to stay positive and remember he isn ' t suffering anymore
yu ##mmy ! that ' s great . it ' s always nice when you ba ##ke something and it turns out just right .
well , that ' s okay . i ' m sure it tasted fantastic .
you could always watch it online !
don ' t worry , i will tell hollywood to make new episodes for you !
a little jealous much ? maybe you should pick up a side job ?
maybe you can borrow them ?
good for you . you deserve to take some time for yourself . anything special on that you want to watch ?
sounds like it ' s going to be a good night . enjoy .
oh wow , you think you baby might be a little sick ?
i ' m glad to hear it . it ' s always nice to get a little " me " time to get things done .
they are very busy but if she made an appointment with you then she should be there on monday .
oh no , you are leaving the neighbors to terror ##ize some un ##sus ##pe ##cting people . that is funny .
om ##g . . you should get out fast as you can then . everyone can ' t be trusted .
oh no , i hate situations like that , when you still have to see people like every day , u ##gh .
don ' t show your anger at all or let her know it got to you .
that will bother her more i believe , lo ##l .
how old is he ? is he mature ?
i am happy for you ! i hope you keep being friends forever !
i bet she was really happy about that .
yi ##kes , that would drive me crazy .
it would drive me crazy also , she should be more consider ##ate .
maybe she will start paying on time .
that ' s awesome ! did it cost you al ##ot ?
well i ' m glad that it worked out for you !
i would feel the same ! heights are scary
lo ##l ! well it ' s ok , it ' s not like you need to do anything with heights - unless you have to fly a lot . i do . . but i don ' t like it
i feel you on that . that is awful . is there anyone above him ?
you want to make trouble ?
oh ok ! i see . well you ' re not making trouble any ##how , he is
why this happened ? is he bad at what he is doing ?
that is terrible if he blamed you .
it will feel good when it done though !
and your hard work will pay off !
sorry to hear that
what happened ?
cool . what did it look like ?
are you going to display it ?
well that ' s nice . maybe you can pass it don to your kids too
that sounds really nice . did you have fun ?
u ##gh , that ' s terrible . i hope you found the money !
sounds like you will ! you sound confident in yourself , and i ' m sure your manager is , or he wouldn ' t have trusted you to do it .
definitely . hopefully lead to a promotion for you soon !
why do you think you will fail ?
when is the test ? practice makes perfect ! fit it in !
how much did you pay for the new one ?
that is a great bargain , will you use it tonight ?
what things are you looking forward to ?
it sounds like your po ##sit ##ivity will bring about something good
how does she help you out ?
she sounds like a great girlfriend
i haven ' t played video games in so long .
i age ##e . i used to lo ##oo ##ove playing mortal ko ##mba ##t .
why is that ?
i get that , i guess you can just bring cleaning supplies !
why didn ' t you finish ?
oh . it ' s not too late is it ?
what has she been lying about ?
are you going to punish her ?
what does he ask about ?
wow . that has got to be annoying . i can never fin ##f my landlord
why didn ' t you wore them ?
that is sad . i hope you find them .
how ' d they ruin it ?
sounds like a mess , were they punished in some way ?
what are you going to do ?
oh , i hope you seek help for that
i am not a football fan . what did they do last season ?
that is super cool . i hope they win this one too .
how ' d she pass away ?
sorry to hear that
i used to play that game with my little cousins

wow that is impressive , how old is she ?
that is impressive , cong ##rat ##s on raising a smart kid !
that is impressive , cong ##rat ##s on raising a smart kid !
call of duty ?
i used to play
i might check it out . get back in the game .
how old is she ?
you didn ' t make them clean it up ?
very cool ! have you ever done yoga before or would this be a first time ?
cool ! i ' ve heard it can be tough but i think it would be fun to try out !
om ##g ! i don ' t blame you . i would be extremely upset also .
mine does also ! it seems like it just keeps getting worse and worse .
yes ! i hate it . i can ' t wait till this dark time in our history is over . hopefully a few people end up in jail !
i don ' t take death well either !
some act like it never happened . a lot of ap ##athy going around . you ' ll see her again someday !
that is certainly a blessing , good for you !
i get that , but i hope that continues for you !
are you happy now ?
well that ' s good . it will come it you work for it .
how many do you have now ?
oh , well there you go , good choice !
what happened ?
i probably would have tried to shoot him thinking he was an intruder
i understand . i had that problem when i was kid . now it is ok .
anyway , you can watch other movies .
why ?
you feel liked now ?
why did you not get driven there ?
wow , that is not safe at all for a kid though
that is great ! i bet you are feeling very good .
it takes a while to feel that great . i am almost there .
sorry to hear that
ye ##a i can understand that

what did you do to him after ?
what ' d he say to that ?
same here . i can ' t do it
i don ; t even try , i can barely watch suspense movies
why is that ?
their todd ##lers were in the street ? i feel like that is almost cp ##s level issues
did you enjoy it ?
what did you do ? sometimes i just sleep and that is enough for me
how did it work out for you ?
good luck i hope all goes well
i am sorry . maybe not focus as friday - sunday as the weekend , but as any other day . and do things you would normally do on other days .
that is a tough one . what do you normally do other then work on those days ?
is there anything else you do besides work ? a hobby you enjoy , video games , music , working out ?
healing is never easy . it always has the negative ##s . any sort of healing always starts with pain , a open wound , and it ##chy sc ##ab ##s , and the left over scar . i wish i could talk to you daily and help you get through it . i know its hard to go and do things alone . i recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down . it is 74 ##17 ##41 . i have used it just recently myself . it does work and is better then nothing .
( thank you for your words ! i have a mom to talk too , so it helps but loads of trauma , abuse and death are hard to even talk about . thank you ! i hope you feel better too ! ) i have had to talk to customers who were nasty to clerks before ! it ' s shocking .
i know right ? oh lord - the food industry is the worst , especially for waitress ##es .
oh ##hh ##h yu ##m ! what are your favorite topping ##s ?
that ' s what i get too ! i also get vega ##n cheese . . . its del ##ish ! hope you have a great time chow ##ing down tonight !

i hope you guys will still get to spend quality time together and of course , get some rest in .
how did you manage
ye ##a
why is that ?
oh , why did you go that way ?
wow that sounds scary and horrible . what was it ?
oh i see . i ' m glad the police came and took care of it . sounds like a scary experience .
if you go into it with a good attitude , i ' m sure at the very least it won ' t be bad . what kind of classes will you be taking ?
o ##oof ! best of luck to you , i ' m sure you ' ll be fine . math was never my strong suit .
why do you like the eagles ?
i understand . i hope that they will win again ,
what did you argue about ?
that is smart , sorry that is happening to you !
what movies do you like to watch instead ?
any favorite actors ?
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha , that is the way sum ##er is supposed to be for kids . did they at least do the things you asked them to do ?
oh ##h no , its worse than i thought . it ' s one thing to relax , but that ' s different . what are you doing to whip them back into shape ?
that ' s terrible . where ?
oh no ! that ' s really terrible .

that ##s awesome that it works for you
ye ##a i can see that
that ' s really good ! did you lose weight , or have you just not felt comfortable with yourself before ?

oh that stink ##s . does she live far away ?
i completely understand that . i ' m so busy i hardly social ##ize at all .
that is sad . do you have other children ?

why its okay to be differ ##nt
if he is rich then i am jealous of him too
that sounds upset ##ing . why were you scared ?
oh man well wear silver . that can supposedly burn them and scare them away .
that ##s awesome !
ye ##a that sounds like a plan
i feel you ! my two kids know all the rules and yet , they just go out the window when they want to take something or use something that isn ' t theirs . i always joke that you can ' t have nice things with kids .
seriously !
congratulations ! are you having a party ?
that ' s sounds nice and romantic
that game was fun to watch last year . do you live in philadelphia ?
i love it there . i don ' t normally like football , but it ' s always good when the patriots lose .
no one has ever given me a car . that must be nice
that very nice of them
what did they do to it ?
kids are like that sometimes , sorry about that
oh no , this is a classic office disaster story . how bad was it ?
ah heck , i hate that for you . hopefully it isn ' t as bad for you as it seems , but just know that that mistake has happened to several people that i know of , so you ' re not alone .
that sounds awesome . i barely remember 3rd grade . i think we just played games and had fun .
wow that ##s so deep . i can ##t imagine having to deal with that at that age . they must ##ve been what like 8 ? that ##s a lot to put on a kid
what did he say ?
why would he even do that ?
that ' s great ! i hope their marriage goes well .
well that may be difficult if you aren ' t married first .
cool ! what kind of business ?
wow that ' s pretty balls ##y nice job !
that is awesome . is she a doctor ?
how much longer does she have in school ?
really ? what you got going on ?
that will be so much mu ##sh . he is going to have a great time .
aw ##w that was nice of them ! !
lo ##l . maybe they all came into work early just to surprise you !
that is great , do you get to see them much ?
that is really good that you get to see them all the time . do you have kids , too ?
that doesn ##t sounds like a surprise
oh you just know that there ' s something going on . that ' s pretty cool
yeah that is pretty upset ##ting . i don ' t get what is so hard about throwing away your trash .
maybe the kids will see all of the trash and see that it is bad and grow up to not litter ?
oh yeah those shows can fascinating !
it ' s true , but i also can ' t help but watch . it ' s exciting to learn in any case .
who ' s car was it ?
what kind of car did she get you ?
that is amazing that you got tickets . what was your favorite part ?
that is awesome . how far in advance did you have to buy the tickets ?
that ' s exciting ! i hope he ' s doing well in school !

maybe you can swap toyota ##s for a day : d
yeah me too . some people have some amazing talents .
yeah magic is pretty great !
those movies are amazing . i loved the last one with than ##os . he was a cool character .
i actually started to understand where he was coming from . . . in a sick kind of way .
that ' s sad . what country is that ?
wow that is far . when did you come here ?
what is it like over there ?
yeah i can imagine it would be simpler there .
aw ##w ##w i completely understand . i remember that feeling . and mine is now a senior . time flies ! cher ##ish every moment with him !
i only have one . and next year he ' ll be going off to college . i wish i didn ' t have to work so much so i could have spent more time with him when he wanted to
ye ##a that would have been great if i could have done it . i ' m happy that you do !
it ' s still better that an empty house !
that sounds so sad . i hope he was ok
you have to be careful though . sometimes people can be really dangerous when they have nothing to lose
why did you want to do that ?
that makes a lot of sense . sometime that ' s just how it goes though .
oh wow , are you okay ? !
i hope so , and i hope you do good in the tournament : ) just rest that finger and let it heal .
oh no : ( i hope there ' s someone you can stay with
from me ? but why lo ##l ?
oh . that sucks i ' m sorry : (
w ##har happened ?
that is very nice . what are going to do with money ?
he must be a super hero , i would have offered to help him ha ##ha .
i wish i could have seen that sight , ask him for his workout schedule .
im so sorry . that ##s horrible . i can ##t imagine how you must feel
i know you can ##t ever replace him , but would you consider getting a new dog ?
yeah i stole money of my mom ' s dresser once .
wow that ' s really rough . it was only $ 5 but she was still really upset about it .
that is weird . did you say anything ?
well that is pretty gross .
what movie ? i can ' t watch scary movies anymore since having kids , they are too realistic now ha ##ha
thank you for the heads up ! maybe sleep with a night light on tonight : ) sweet dreams !
oh no ! extra work ##load is terrible ! did you make it through ?
i bet . did you relax when you got home ?
that ' s a killer end to a stress ##ful day !
why ? what happened ?
oh ! i thought it was something bad , i hate roller coaster ##s too !
good luck !
that ' s kind of sad . what makes you reluctant ?
well i ' m sure the odds are against him , but i hope he succeeds this time .
man , i wish i had the money to afford a boat , i don ' t know about you .
imagine days spent cruising around on the water !
you got this girl ! i was induced when i had my daughter a year ago ! i was scared too but honestly don ' t remember much .
just enjoy and rest on your last weekend before baby , it ' ll all be worth in when you are holding your little girl : ) don ' t listen to those scary stories , those are the 1 in a million chances it goes wrong !
that ' s awesome ! what kind of restaurant is it ?
oh those are great and a lot of times they make everything fresh ! what is your favorite meal there ?
did you find any ?
wow
that ' s super frustrating ! did you walk out ?
that ' s the bit i kind of don ' t like about restaurants . i get why they don ' t let you get your own beverages but at the same time it seems unnecessary to have to wait for someone to ref ##ill your glass .
wow , are you ok ?
ha ##ha ##ha , that must ' ve been pretty funny though . im assuming he / she helped you up ?
that ' s good , where was it ?
what would you do with friends ?
sounds like you luck ##ed out , make sure she knows how special she is : )
yes , don ' t let a night go by without saying i love you .
that makes a lot of sense . i wouldn ' t be happy either ! i hope that they have good insurance
wow ! that ' s awe ##ful . is your mom ok ?
man that really does stink ! hopefully the police will find some way to catch the guy !
what kind of tricks can you do ?
that ##s pretty cool ! i am fascinated by that !
does he have a bad back or was it just an enormous thing ? did you get to go over ?
oh my goodness ! that ' s awesome ! does that feel weird to know he ' s going to be a dad ?
those have got to be some good memories for you !
yeah life really comes at you fast huh ?
what ##s happening tomorrow ?
oh wow that sounds like fun , your a great uncle !
kids can be so annoying sometimes . i hate those shoes with wheels that they have . so annoying
i just saw a girl wearing them at wal ##gree ##ns tonight . i wanted to trip her lo ##l
what rides did you go on ?
i hate roller ##co ##aster ##s too !
sounds relaxing , being a mom i could use a day like that !
i hope it was a good day for you , at ##lea ##st you did something productive and got some laundry done ha ##ha
that ' s pretty gross . it happens though . did they com ##p you ?
great ! they should get a great review as we all have hair everywhere . it ' s bound to happen at some point .
how long have you been sick ?
wow , that ' s a lot . is it clearing up ?
wow ! impressive ! he must be beaming and you must be so proud !
i bet his face was price ##less when he found out ! those are the best times in life ! take him out for vega ##n ice cream !
i ' m impressed you didn ' t explode ! my wife would ' ve gone insane . she hates that kind of stuff . how long did it take to clean up ?
what i ' ve found is everything is salvage ##able if you really want / need to . i recommend looking on youtube to see how to remove the oil from the fabric . keep your head up , you ' ll be alright !
i know there will be something on there ! youtube has taught me more about life than my parents . in 20 minutes you will know how to clean your couch and take the engine out of your car .
oh those places are fun . its like dinner and a show . . was it expensive ?
that ##s smart . we went to one for my wife ##s birthday once and it cost a fortune !
are you moving ?
i went on vacation about 4 months ago , it was really fun . i went to orange beach , al
they are really bad especially if you have pets .
ye ##a . you have to be careful with flies , because they can lay eggs in your pet ' s food .

i have never tried it
wow , you must be proud ! how old is he ?
they grow up so fast ! glad he isn ' t scared anymore .
you got a day off ? man i wish i could get a day off
was it fun ?
how did it turn out
that ##s cool that you made it through
oh boy ! congratulations are in order then ? ! ! how many kids do you have then ?
i totally get it . if i found out that i was pregnant right now , i ' d pass out and cry for a few minutes and then be happy . ha ha . i pray for your wife and her body ! he he .
i would be disappointed in him if i were you . he sounds like a real low life . maybe you should kick that bum to the curb .
i don ' t , if it were up to me we would all be artificial ##ly ins ##emi ##nated and men would be kept like livestock .
what did he do ?
cool !
she ##esh that ##s a great deal !
how many packs did you stock up with ? lo ##l
why , what happened ? ! i hope your dog is okay .
oh man , i ' m sorry . my two dogs are my baby ##s , i can ' t imagine how you feel .

that makes a big difference . getting your feng shu ##i on the go !
$ 20 bucks ? i ' d try to do it too . how ' d it go ? ?
awesome ! he ' ll know not to challenge you next time ! $ 20 bucks richer !
is this her first one ?
that ##s good
where ' d everyone go ?
ha ##ha ##ha did you kick family or room ##ies out ?
that sucks . what ' s going on next week ?
i don ' t think anyone enjoys going to the dentist .
aw ##w im sorry . did they leave without you
that was really nice of them . you have some really good friends
that is so scary , what happened ?
wow , that is scary ! be careful .
oh ##hh congratulations ! i am sure you will be ok . is it your first ?
think of how many people have babies . if they can do it so can you !
did anyone see ?
oh well you lived through it !
really ? why was that ?
well there are some good safety apps for your phone that a friend can monitor you as you walk home . maybe you want to try one of those .
that ' s what mom ' s do ! i think it ' s in our blood .
that is true , not all mom ##s are that way and that is sad .
that ' s fantastic to hear !
how long have you been married ?
wow , must ' ve been scary
that ' s good at least
that ' s crazy ! i wonder if he ' s stock ##ing up or is cooking for a lot of people .
2 bags and i ' m already struggling .
make a plan to pl ##uck her away
dump the first , and go for her
that ' s really awesome ! cat ' s are like the best pets ever .
oh . . . i didn ' t know those were real .
did she pass away , or did something else happen ?
that ' s sad , one of my friend ' s dog died a few years ago . we were all very sad because he was such a nice pit
i don ' t really trust dealers ##hips . what ' s wrong with your car ?
ah you ' re getting maintenance done . that ' s good .
that is so exciting and different .
i bet so , that doesn ' t happen often .
i ' m sorry to hear that !
good luck . maybe a better opportunity will come around .
i can relate my brothers ex wife , uses all the child support money on her self and her crack head boyfriend , my brother buys my niece ##s close and toys because she won ##t
its horrible to hear , but i agree with you 100 percent some people should not have kids at all
that is some dedication . did he finally heal up ?
i ' m glad to hear that he is better now - you did a great thing by helping him .
oh no that ##s terrible . where do you live ?
oh yeah that could be dangerous !
that ' s really awesome that you have a great partner like her !
yes i am and my wife is awesome too !
sharks are definitely scary .
is where you went known to have sharks ?
wow , that ' s very nice of them ! someone taught them well .
yes , each kid has their own personality sometimes . i ' ve seen some families that had some kids that were angels , and one of them was a nightmare !
i am sorry to hear that . i hope she is comfortable at least .
do you have plans on how to spend these last days with her ?
oh man ! i bet you felt bad .
i am sure she understands it was an accident .
that is so good to hear ! what makes her so great !
you have a great wife for sure then .
do you have to pass the gr ##e ?
your husband could probably help you with the math portion !
got ##cha . . . bo ##ck bo ##ck chick ##a chick ##a

they sound like good knives
did he like it ?
they grow up so fast ! you must be proud of them though .
do they bother your stomach ?
oh goodness , so you have an allergic reaction to them then ? do you have to carry an ep ##i pen just in case some slip by you unaware ?
significant others can be hit or miss sometimes .
your husband sounds like a keeper . how long have you two been together ?
have you made an appointment with your doctor ?
i would just to be safe !
that ' s very true , but i ' m sure their both very smart and know how to avoid dangerous situations .
that will be great ! a little peace of mind is all you need .
that ##s awesome ! what college you go to ?
holy smoke ##s that ##s leg ##it !

my best friend just told me that they are planning to get a sex change . i had no idea !
he is planning to be a she as soon as she can get the operation scheduled with the doctor . i think i will take at least a few months .

oh that sounds good . the closest sub store we have is subway .
he must be so precious !
cher ##ish him while you can . they really grow up fast .
wow . that ' s crazy . what even happened ?
someone should definitely report him .
how do you feel about it ? honestly if someone is respectful to me i don ##t care who they like , that ##s the way my dad raised me
im straight but the way my dad raised me , he said to respect all sexes , and what ever religion i choose was up to me , i have never gone to church
oh no ! what happened ? ?
om ##g who was it ? what did they do ? ?

a hit and run . not many people are responsible anymore .
me too , people can be so cruel .
it definitely can be .
that is scary ! it happened to me as well so i bought a couple of guns
yep us too , its sad we have to have those
it ' s always nice to have people around you that care about you . they make hard times much easier .
how ' s the wrist feeling now ? any permanent damage ?

that is kind of sad . i hate it when places from your childhood close or are torn down .
yeah that is too bad .
oh ye ##a ? how ' d it go ?
oh no , how did mom take it ? did she tease you ?
i hate when that happens , especially when you have something else pictured .
are you able to send it back ?
i can ' t imagine . how old is he ?
yeah , that ' s a hard age to separate from a child . they don ' t really understand . i have to leave my 16 year old sometimes and he jumps for joy .
that is a nice surprise ! do you usually work every weekend ?
i am glad you got this one off !
ye ##a they grow up way too fast
ye ##a

hey i saw breaking benjamin a couple years ago at an un ##pl ##ug ##ged concert in nashville ! you ' re gonna have some fun ! !
e ##w ##w , that ##s gross ! poor kid needs to learn some manners !

my wife loves that name , we have a son that will be 2 in december . if we have another one his name will be knox
who are you going to see ?
that will be a fun concert !
it ' s nice to hear someone thinking about others . many people who luck out don ' t care what happens to others or are grateful for their lot in life .
sounds like you have a great family .
tell me about it . it ' s over 100 almost every day here and it ' s so humid it makes the air feel sticky !

you must be excited ! will it go on the whole day ?
that ' s still awesome . have a great time !
what are you playing ?
wow that is impressive ! !
sometimes that is good and sometimes it is bad . depends on how bad you need the money . i hope it was a good thing for you .

good luck ! need something bigger ?
ye ##a i feel your pain ! we will be buying a bigger home also

that always stink ##s , i hate being short handed
man that will be great , working long shifts ain ##t fun
fishing is truly fun . we occasionally go with my friends too . do you go frequently ?
that is bad . do you live in a place with high humidity ?
you ever cut it yourself ? or is it too big of a yard ?
ye ##a sometimes its relaxing to be out there cutting the grass by yourself
that ' s awful , i hope no one in your family was hurt .
luckily . in bad situations like that , it is always best to remind ourselves that things could have been a lot worse for ourselves .
that sounds like a lot of fun ! who are you going to see ?
awesome ! they play some good music !
whoa that ##s shocking ! how old is she ?
holy smoke ##s that ##s a huge gap !
we always do that , its so convenient
no way its awesome !
you ' re gonna be tired the next day .
too bad it ' s on a sunday .
that ' s great , how long was it on for ?
that is a pretty long time to have your leg wrapped up . how ' d you in ##jure it ?
ye ##a . after all that , i think it ' s definitely time for you to relax and have fun !
you should be proud of yourself really .
hey that ' s a good deal ! where was this ?
yeah that sounds soo ##oo ##o good right now ! i may need to go to chinese tonight ! !
oh no . what happened ?
oh no . can you go back ?
i ' m sure you ' ll do fine if you practice enough !
understand ##ably so , i get nervous during presentations too . take some deep breaths and you ' ll pull through !
what show is it ?
is that a play or music band ?
that is the worst , i hate when people can ##t park
i know the feeling , there are a ton of people like that too

wow , that sounds like fun ! she ' s so beautiful .
yes she does . she ' s very talented . i ' d love to see her live .
that is so scary ! people are so desperate these days .
i would have been , too . i am glad you are okay !

dirty 30 parties are the best !
what got in the way of your plans ?
that ' s such a shame , i ' m sorry to hear that .
oh no ! did anyone help you ?
yeah i can imagine
that is horrible . do you live in a city or rural areas ?
it is unbelievable to meet these wild animals in a city . you should definitely call them
bosses can be such ah ##oles !
yep if it deserves to be yelled at that ##s one thing
i ' m a reds fan myself . . . . . . . . i know the braves have a good chance of winning their division and i agree , probably not made for a deep playoff ren .
yeah . . . . i have no complaints with him . . . . . his salary is too big for the franchise but that ain ' t his fault .
you must have felt very lonely .
at least you were productive !
what did he tell you ? did he like them as well
when my brother loves the things i love , it makes me feel good like we are bonding
that ##s a shame ! did he get any of it back ?
that ##s good , my house was also broken in to
hey , it ' s never too late . unless you can ' t exercise at all there is always a way to start .
don ' t worry about the cal ##ories for now . just start moving more , and maybe join an exercise class . you ' ll start to enjoy it , and before you know it the weight will just start dropping off !
it ' s not good to be stuck alone . i ' m sure you can make friends with someone there !
take it from me , you ' ve got to work on getting over that shy ##ness before it ' s too ing ##rained in you ! i ' m still pretty intro ##verted but i enjoy meeting new people now and it helps with my emotional state a ton .
oh no ! how are you handling the disappointment ?
that ' s a great attitude to have about it . but i understand that it still sting ##s a bit .
that is a big moment . are you a little sad ?
i would be a mess , my son is about to turn two and i am sad about that . time goes by so fast .

oh . maybe watch some cool youtube vi ##ds ?
that ' s awesome ! mine has been just fine , not bad

lo ##l dude is living the life
lo ##l he has no cares which is always good
that ' s great ! what kind of show ?
oh sweet ! i ' d love to go to one of their shows myself . i hope you have a great time .
good , credit and debt are bad things .
what you are saying is true . me too , i hate paying f ##pr interests .
take the knife and destroy it the next time it lands . that way they will learn a valuable lesson
kids can be annoying and such outcomes can teach them on how to properly behave
hey that ' s amazing ! ! what did you major in ?
that ' s pretty cool ! i ' m so glad for you ! i bet that was a lot of paper writing : d
what show ?

that ' s really awesome . your friends sound really great !
make sure you do something good for them in return !
i bet it was nice to have extra help .
your sister sounds pretty awesome
oh no ! i know how violated that can make you feel - did they ever get caught ?
i can understand that ! otherwise you are just wondering all the time who it is and if they will come back . i hope you were able to get some security systems in place to help feel more at ease .
yeah the new places are always really busy when they first open too !
yeah same here
where you going ?
nice , i have a friend who lives in florida hope you all enjoy it there
i know , right . i miss seeing the phone booths everywhere .
wow ! i haven ' t thought about them in years . i can ' t remember the last time i saw one .
my daughter is thinking about that career track . is it hard though when an animal doesn ' t make it ?
that would be the only thing that would keep me from it . i admire those that care for our animals , so thanks to you for being you .
that sounds like fun . how do you feel about it ?
that sounds like a great time !
what beach are you going to ?
i was born in savannah !
i don ' t know much about baseball but i went to a braves game a few weeks ago and it was fun

awesome ! i ' m sure they will all do their best !
those don ' t sound like friends . i ' d be extremely pissed off !
yeah , don ' t let them lie to you . i don ' t know them , obviously , but that sounds like an excuse to me too .
what were they looking for ?
i can ' t imagine how anxious that must have made you . i am glad it turned out to be benign .
i ' m sorry to hear that . that ' s a pretty common response to break ups . a lot of people go through it , so you ' re not alone ! i hope you pull through soon .
that ' s great to hear ! i ' m sure you ' ll find someone better soon .
hell no it does not , these people out here stealing that is exactly why im afraid of buying from e bay , a lot of bad reviews
i would be really upset too , i have received defective merchandise too and its upset ##ting , waiting for the product for 1 week and checking the mail every day , only to get it broken
oh congratulations ! that ' s wonderful news .
i am very happy for you . i wish you all the best !
yu ##m i love buffet ##s !

you know what , i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and i hope i will one day
oh no ! have you spoken to her at all since she left ?
that is so sad to hear ! perhaps after she cool ##s down a bit ya ' ll will be able to work it out .
yes it is . it ' s like you turn around and 10 years has gone by .
wouldn ' t that be great . think of all the changes we could make .
that ' s incredible ! you must feel on top of the world !
i ' m sure all the hard work and effort you put in to it really shows . i am trying to get in shape myself , and your story is inspiring !
i
i ' m so sorry to hear that do you try and ##sp ##end a lot of time with her so she doesn ' t feel that way ?
that is great to hear now she has to build even more memories with you and your family so the lo ##osing of your dad can get better for her .
what ' s happening next month ? !

nothing like mail to bright ##en up your day ! what was it ?
what a great gift ! i have always wanted a polar ##oid instant camera !
did he arrive back early ?
i bet you were extremely happy . a year without seeing a parent can be a very lonely feeling .
that is so sad . i am sorry . losing a pet is so hard . they are family .
i know the feeling . the thought of replacing them seems impossible . only time will tell if you are ever ready for another .
that is so awesome and a great accomplishment do you plan to write more in the future ?
science was never my strongest but i admire those who love it because they are super smart i hope your next article makes it into a even bigger news article .

it ' s cool to always remember those milestone ##s . helps to keep us motivated .

i don ' t blame you . it ' s so sad to know that you have to leave them there .
that ##s good , was it a 1 . 00 scratch off ?
i would be happy too , but i would probably buy 20 tickets after and lose in every single one with my luck

it ' s funny !
wow ! that is gross , did you kill it ?
i hope you lit it on fire !
such things are very rare if you use services from rep ##utable delivering companies . what carrier did you use for your delivery ?
it is very unusual . ups is very competitive company and they should have resolved the issue quickly
oh no ! did you get a police report and exchange information ?
it ' s always good to exchange the information to make sure that they follow up about that . hope your car gets fixed soon .
that is definitely something to celebrate !
do you have big plans ?
oh no , that ' s a horrible feeling
uh oh ! maybe time to move on
what is going to happen in september ?

well , that will be great ! where are y ' all going ?
we just got back from there 2 weeks ago , we stayed at mira ##mar beach . i ' m sure it will be a lot of fun and relaxation !
right . what is the purpose of going to movies if people talk there . un ##in ##formed people everywhere
you should confront them next time if it happens . they should be put in their place for improper social behavior
are you going to get it fixed ?
will she give you any money for the repair ?
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . it ' s very hard to lose a loved one , i know from personal experience .
yes , even though death is part of life , it ' s very hard . i hope things are better for you .
awe shu ##cks , what stopped you ?
well i do hope you get to have your hike soon ! i ' m sure if you keep putting in the work it will pay off eventually .

nos ##tal ##gic isn ##t it ?
that is terrible news . how did he die ?
i lost my friend to a heart attack . he was only 35 .
oh really ? i can imagine
oh that ##s too bad but i bet you will do fine
oh , well that doesn ' t sound good . but , maybe you have good reasons ?
oh , well , in all honesty , it probably won ' t last if he ' s a bad guy anyway .
oh no , how did that make you feel ?
it happens . but next time you ; ll be more aware
well that ' s very sweet of him !
i always love surprises like that . and a new laptop is a pretty big deal . enjoy it !
oh i didn ##t get a chance to see the game
wow that ##s insane
what did you do after they cut you off ?
did you at least hon ##k your horn ?
that sounds so annoying to deal with .
without a doubt , most drivers are total mor ##ons .
ah that bad ! ! . you need again to wait for ages ! !
when you see them again it will be worth a wait ! !
wow good for you man
dan ##g that is so awesome
did you make friends eventually ?
how did you get through it ?
i ' m not sure i ' ve ever used them . i think my earliest music media was cassette ##s .
that ' s cool . the history of them are as well , sometimes , it ' s nice to use something from the past .
that ' s awesome . how ' d he do ?
nice . i bet you were so proud .
you definitely should cher ##ish these moments .
how did your sister react ?
how did that make you feel ?
that ' s alright . she ' s family , so she will still love you . just learn from this mistake .
oh wow , why ?
damn , hopefully you ' re doing better now .
what went wrong ?
did you use tin ##der again ?
with trump in the presidency , it won ' t end soon . you can bet on that
you know nothing about politics , go watch soap operas
so you consider yourself total loser in life ?
it is pathetic and unacceptable . you should grow up and stop being so ir ##res ##pon ##sible
did it hurt ?
did you go to the doctor ?
ye ##a that ##s fair , iv ##e done the same thing
ha ##ha that might be too far
that was my favorite game ever
same , it was awesome
that ' s pretty good reflex ##es on his part .
so many of my friends have cracked phones so i guess mine are cl ##ums ##ier .
same ! that is why i never go outside and just be on my computer all day !
you got this ! fake it until you make it !
maybe you shouldn ' t go then .
hopefully nothing bad will happen .
ah so sad for you , where did he / she moved ?
oh yeah , nice pace though but you will miss him a lot i guess ! !
i imagine that was a big surprise ! did you ever mention to him ?
well , i can relate . my sister and i found some playboy magazines nos ##ing around too !
i am sure there will be another chance .
maybe you should buy him lunch to make a peace offering .
what happened ? is there anything specific that makes you feel that way ?
then why don ' t you go shopping ? is it because you have financial difficulties ?
i somewhat disagree . it ' s been so hot i ' ll be happy to see the end of summer .
that is a pretty good trade ##off .
is the phone working ?
did he get dirty when he dove ?
oh that must be scary
wow well good luck
i would think they are now . are they already closed down for the summer ?
oh , i see . well , they are a lot of fun !
what makes you think that ?
that ' s pretty much the same reason that i don ' t want kids .
i never use tin ##der due to that reason .
have you ever tried any other apps ?
yi ##kes ! did you study real hard for it ?
aw ##w . i think you will do okay !
that ##s awesome
that ##s so cool , good for him
how come . i can ' t imagine weddings without the presence of parents . you should convince her to come
but it is you who choose which girl to marry and which one not . you should try to explain it to her that old days are over
have you studied ?
you will do fine , i know it .
sounds like a fun event . what all is there to it ?
yes , that would be quite fun ! my children will not go to haunted house , no matter how much we try to bribe them lo ##l
that ' s so great ! most people aren ' t .
i know some people that eat healthy , but still struggle with their weight . so , that ' s great you don ' t !
wow , so far i ' ve just had a girlfriend for a week and got laid a few times .
true , though i just wish girls weren ' t so shallow sometimes .
that is good , you shouldn ' t even go on tin ##der .
that wasn ' t ever nice of her .
really ? i ' ve always wanted to see them ! when did you go
awesome ! so glad they ' re still rocking after all these years !
where do you shop ?
where is the trip to ?
oh that ##s really cool , good luck
seems like a tough sport
did you apologize to them ?
it ok , mistakes happen .
you should go out and meet new people .
do you have friends now ?
ye ##a i agree
they are important to the ecosystem but i wish they would stay away from me
when is the test ?
that is good , you must of studied a long time .
wow that must have been a huge moment for you
well good for you
uh oh ##h ! did you hon ##k at them ?
yeah . i ' d say so . i can ' t stand bad drivers !
oh man must ##ve brought back memories
wow that sucks so bad
you can at least phone them .
you can go visit .
nice association . do you have any memory attached to it ?
do you visit her often ?
that ' s so wonderful ! i had a very close relationship with my sister too . i always treasure ##d it and loved her so much !
that ' s so great . my sister was mine too . she passed away several years ago , so never take him for granted and treasure every moment with him !
oh wow that sounds really tough
well good luck with that
that is horrible news , so sorry .
how did he die ?
oh you did ? what was it about ?
dan ##g that ##s a bit low
did you pull over to help ?
that was nice of you .
what did they do to make you proud ?
that is good news . what kind of job ?
oh no , when did that happen ?
how old are you ? it ' s more rough when you ' re young .
sorry to hear that .
how did he die ?
is there a chance you won ##t ?
hopefully you get it
why ? must be something fun and exciting going on ?
oh , well no doubt that will be fun ! i like that it isn ' t fake , like wrestling .
that is great you have friends .
how often do you see them .
that ##s so cool .
that ##s great , happy for you
same here , he must make so much money .
i totally agree .
why was that ?
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
o ##of was it the cost ?
yi ##kes that ##s quite a sum of money
did you call a tow truck ? lo ##l .
did you ice your toe ?
that ' s great ! but , what is it ?
oh , okay ! well , i love some black ##jack . i like poker , but better at black ##jack . but , not on your level by any means ! good for you !
oh that sucks ! why did he / she make you work ? ?
yeah i ' ve worked for bosses like that in the past . at least you get overtime ?
that ' s cool . is he smart ?
what position does he play ?
are they ? damn i can ' t believe i didn ' t hear .
agreed , that would be bad ##ass .
what was the name of the film ?
i love that movie .
oh , well it happens sometimes and can ' t be helped . but , i understand why it would make you feel bad too !
i ' m sure it probably upset them , but maybe they realize it was for a reason . and i ' m sure they ' ve done the same thing .
that ##s so cool .
wow that ##s impressive
did anyone get hurt ?
did you yell at the other person ?
wow that ##s so horrible
hopefully well
wow , that is pretty cool
and when did this happened ?
that ' s awesome ! college or high school ?
that ' s great to hear ! what is his major ?
yes , i have many great weeks .
what happened to make it great ?
did you not study for it ?
hopefully you learned a lesson from this experience . if you want to do well you need to be prepared .
that was nice of her !
make sure to tell her that !
i could imagine . were you two very close ?
it ' s good to have that close bond with your siblings , though .
what is the issue ?
won ' t you still be able to see her ?
ah you used her . you should have filled . but however she will understand
oh mom ' s will be mom . she will forgive you
do you like it ?
which color is it ?
how many people entered ?
that isn ' t a lot of people but still a good job .
i don ' t think i know that band . but , i ' m sure you will have lots of fun !
well there ya go , i didn ' t know . the week ##nd sounds like a band , more than just one person .
anything in particular ?
you need to catch up .
your high school yearbook ?
how old are you ?
when do you think it will happen ?
you think so ? do you have a plan for the end of the world ?
oh ? what made you so mad ?
oh i hate that too . just let me buy what i need to buy and leave .
did you manage to get it ?
as long as you keep the gp ##a to what you need though
did you pass ?
i am glad for you
om ##g . . . how gross . what did you do ?
lo ##l . . . . i think that ' s when i would start crying .

thank you so much : d
that is kinda sad
did you talked to her after ?
e ##w , that ' s pretty gross since the floor is probably dirty as hell .
especially in public when people can see you do it .
lo ##l , well , they must have been very good then . we all over ##ind ##ul ##ge at times , so don ' t feel too bad .
well , it can be hard to resist sometimes . but , maybe just eat a bit health ##ier for a few days , and it ' ll make up for it .
oh yeah ! it ' s so painful . did you do that today ?
things will get better from here on out
they call that post traumatic stress disorder
i think you should
i ' m sure you ' re gonna nail it ! what is the job ?
have you worked in one before ?
cool . so you have some good experience . i ' d say this new job is yours ! good luck !
you ' re welcome my friend . it ' s their loss if they don ' t hire you !
every single one ? that ' s messed up .
i wouldn ' t wish that on my worst enemy .
wow , that is a good friend
nice , did you passed the test ?
that situation can make you app ##re ##hen ##sive . what would be making him upset ?

i would be too , so that ' s understand ##able .

ye ##a it feels so bad
wow that really sucks , im sure you will bounce back
is she sick or was it was one time thing ?
was it a new rug
sc ##umb ##ag ! how can we find out who ?

why are you so lonely ?
oh , you and your silly pigs .
that is so great of you .
i am very happy for you .
sounds scary
good luck with that then
why you say that ?
that is such a shame to hear , you could try having an imaginary friend
he sounds like a bad influence

i ' d hope so too !
wow that ##s awesome

why don ' t they eat lunch with you ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
that does not sounds good ! are you proud of him for standing up ?
i am glad for him . bull ##ies should not be allowed to behave badly towards others .
that ' s good , how old is your son ?
oh he is quite a grown man . i bet you wanted to catch up on old time growing up with him
do you have certain expectations for your son ?
that ' s something for which to be proud ! why don ' t you feel good about it ?
oh that sucks . what is it that she does ?
they ' re professional na ##gger ##s . it ' s just what they do .

oh goodness ! how did you react ?
wow , it has served you well
yes you do that buddy
you must have prepared well in advance to not be nervous !
good for you ! hard work always pays off buddy .
that ' s nice of her ! i bet you were shocked when you saw everybody !
that ' s awesome , it ' s nice to feel loved .
why ' s that ?
that ' s really nice to hear , i hope it goes well .
oh no that sounds really scary !
luckily you weren ' t hurt though !
it must have been a very hard decision for you .
i hope so too , it will take hard work but its possible .
i feel so worried about this its impossible to stay for 15 ##day ##s
oh , thank god you were escape you have to thank god for doing great things
oh ye ##a same
seems super cool
i ' m sorry to hear that .
i hope you are feeling better .
ye ##a i know that tilt ##s me so hard

that ' s good , think you ' re gonna get an a ?
yeah hopefully you do pretty well at least .
i was as well . what was it that impressed you most ?
definitely . hopefully the next world cup will surprise just as much .
why ' s that ? do you think people will assume you are stealing ?
that ' s terrible . i could see how that would stay with you .
wow that sounds like one tough cookie !
yeah that ' s nice but at some point you have to learn your own limits .
oh that ##s nice , it ' s a happy thing to expect a child
congratulations buddy
that ' s not too nice , did you punish him ?
hopefully this was just a one time thing .
i hate eating dinner by myself . what happened that you ended up eating dinner alone ?
i don ##t like being alone much either . what would cause you to have bad thought ? were you scared ?
i know the feeling .
it ' s hard to hold back the truth sometimes .
sounds like a lot of hard work .
i agree .
that ' s not acceptable even if he is drunk .
i hope you get to set him straight somehow .
you must be very happy now .
i hope you keep it forever .
that ##s good of you
ye ##a no problem
e ##w ##w , did you get angry with her ?
i hope you didn ##t abandon her .
i hate cats that throw up .
i am sure your shoes can be cleaned .
wow that sucks
ye ##a hopefully you find it
i know . it seems like i ' ve been up early every weekend for a while now . really wish i could sleep in !
what can you do when your body refuses to cooperate , eh ?
why were you so down on yourself about failing ?
that ##s not a great attitude as you at least must give a go . you only fail if you don ' t try .
to your partners , you mean ?
you should find a way to be satisfied with just one person .
that ' s a great gesture ! is this for your first child ?
definitely . congratulations and good luck !
why did you do that ?
yeah , we all were at some point .
that ##s disgusting
i would be to
i ' m sorry to hear that . have you tried to talk to a professional about that ?
that ' s terrible . i hope the situation sorts itself out .
that ' s intense , what for ?
that ' s awful , i hope she turns out alright .
you should be confident .
i am proud of you !
that ' s good ! keep it up . it ' s hard to follow routine sometimes
it ' ll pay off in the end
same here , though it is the summer for me .
i guess so , though i ' m tired so i want to sleep .
lo ##ool ##ll i ' m the same way i hate their lack of will ##power !
yeah at what point would you not look yourself in the mirror and be disgusted ?
i think people find a way to lie to them ##sel ##f , and convince themselves that it isn ' t that bad . body di ##smo ##rp ##hia .
so sorry , that must be devastating for you .
how long does he have left ?
why do you get embarrassed ?
i bet you are great at it !
yu ##ck that ##s disgusting , did you throw up ?

yes ! me and my buddy go camping every year when it cool ##s off .
yeah its been way to hot here lately to do anything .
that sounds so scary !
i ' m sorry , heights are the worst .
oh no ! i would have been run ##nni ##ng up and down the halls yelling .
did you find out who did it and publicly spray ke ##tch ##up all over them .
sorry to hear that , that ##s disappointing when people pull out last minute .
did you let them know how you felt ?
yes may very well be gay . nothing wrong with that . iv ##e had al ##ot of gay friends .
if you just stay confident and believe in yourself i know you can do it !
i am so happy for you !
enjoy your time there !
what did you eat ? was it delicious .
pizza is my life ##blood , along with beer .
were you excited or annoyed that the driver left them there ?
i know the feeling when you get the items you ordered . i think the anticipation os more exciting then actually having them .
yes they are so soft and fun to cu ##ddle to .
ha if only , if only people told you what they wanted like dogs do .
that is the case for me too !
yeah , i know that feeling .
wow that ##s a long time to wait for pizza .
did you complain ? or at least ask for a discount .
was there anything in the pockets ?
ha ##ha the best would have been the girls phone number
ha ##ha yes all the time , and its even worse when they speak .
u ##gh , yes like can ##t you tell from my body language i don ##t want to talk .
i bet they don ' t follow it
well ##l one day they will see you were right

i think it ' s fun to buy one every now and then , but wouldn ' t be my go - to for entertaining gambling .
yu ##m that sounds delicious . you ' re making me hungry .
you should just get a half vegetarian . no need to punish your self like that .
ye ##a tell me about it . . . im still paying off cc ' s from when my wife and i were dating : p
he ##h
why ' s that
oh i feel ya . no kids yet so i ' m soaking up all the freedom i can ha ##ha ##ha
that ' s great . practice makes perfect .
keep at it . maybe one day you can start selling those drawings for money .
congratulations ! how long have you been running for ?
it ' s a really healthy hobby to have ! they say sitting down is really bad for you .
he ##h . . it was ok but kinda boring in a theater
well at least you saw it then . . some people won ##t even try
i can understand . then are times when i want to get out of work too .
sometimes it is helpful to take a break and go home early . it allows you to kind of reset .
that ##s awesome . . how long did that take
ye ##a i can understand that
i hope it ' s paid too .
are you going somewhere for a vacation ?
i love fossils !
what do you like about them >
what ' s going on monday ?
yeah , i guess that will be like a vacation for you .
why would it be wrong ?
ah ye ##a it happens
oh no ! is it serious ?
well i hope that it isn ' t serious and your dog makes it through
cong ##rad ##ulation ##s . i assume it comes with a pay raise .
with a window ?
awesome . i ' m almost a little jealous
what do you mean ? did you get stuck somewhere ?
lam ##me ##e , did you at ##lea ##st finish up the file ?
did you throw him out ?
did it work ?
that ' s terrible ! i ' m really sorry to hear that , but even if you could have said something it doesn ' t just make it better .
is that what happened to her ? my mother was like that as well . it ' s terrible to watch somebody you loved turn into someone else because of an addiction .
that would be annoying . if there is anybody over him , you might try reporting it first .
lo ##l , maybe you could ask for another department
man i have recently been getting into shoes , i don ##t have nearly as many as some of my buddies , need to step my game up .
i just like the style , i want to show off with ever outfit .
oh hate when that happens . how did you know you acted a fool
you ' ll figure it out . i believe in you
why ?
i hate that . i ' m glad you ' re ok !
we all do stupid stuff as kids . the important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now .
i understand regret over previous actions , but you just got to move forward .
good for him ! the only time i ' ve ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game .
it ' s def ##ini ##tly a really hard thing to do . your friend must be really lucky !
sorry to hear that
i can see that
you and me both .
the power ##ball drawing is tonight ; )
car door ?
when did that happen ?
i just found one in my toilet the other night !
how bad was it ?
that ' s really cool that you have those awesome memories . do you ever go ba ##ack and see your family ?
well i hope you have a good time !
have you always had this fear of the dark
is there any specific reason why ?
have you ever been there before ? i hear it ' s great !
save up and sign up for deal alert ##s on ex ##ped ##ia and other sites . it ' s really amazing how cheap you can get trips nowadays !
oh wow , where do you get these pets ? from a shelter or off the street ?
oh wow , that ##s good of you to be able to bring in dogs off the street .
wow that ##s great , is that the one you got off the street ?
well i wish you good luck on that one !
oh my god . . i would be too ! no locks ?
oh . . . i have locks on all my gates and the companies have to ask for permission . that is terrible ! did you get your dog back ?
have you tried find a away to keep the sep ##erated ?
i ' m sure that it will get better . dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her i ' m sure she will get it .
oh my go ##sh ! it sound like she has a had a rough life . you are great for taking care of her !
i am bad with anxiety too but if you haven ' t done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and hope for the best . you never know - you could be getting a raise !
prepare then and you will feel better - either way it goes you will be prepared - so if it ' s bad - you will already have known and if it ' s not - then you will get surprised . either way it won ' t rock your world .
oh man ! well all you can do is prepare early as you just never know ! life is ##ful ##l of change .
that ' s pretty awesome . what breed
that ' s pretty generous of you to adopt an abused dog , especially a pregnant one . that ' s a lot of responsibility but i love pit ##bu ##lls too so i would ' ve done the same
well of course . . like all the drunk ##s and drug ##gies begging for money who won ' t work on my corner ? most people are poor . . and work hard !
poor people are the hardest workers in america usually . . it ' s corps that have a huge pay gap and the ceo ##s make ridiculous money while the people keeping the companies don ' t even make a living wage
oh no . i ' m sorry : (
pets are great but they sure are tragic .
that ' s good that you were prepared ! puppy ##s can be a handful .
man that does sound like a handful !
i hear you ! tell me about your family ?
why did you move away from home ? that is cool to have a brother in highs ##cho ##ol . highs ##cho ##ole ##rs usually aren ' t home much any ##how
oh my goodness ! that would be so hard ! !
you the pit ##bu ##ll guy ? ha ##ha
gal : ) ) what did you end up naming the pup ?
it ' s rare to have great parents it seems , i am glad you have good ones !
i feel the same about my mom ! wonderful ! remember to cher ##ish them daily , as we never know what can happen and aren ' t promised tomorrow
aw ##w , i hate to hear that . how long have you two been together ?
well , hopefully when it ' s all said and done it ' ll be be worth it . best of luck with it .
i have never actually had one of those ! we don ' t get very exotic fruits here in the midwest . what do they taste like ?
never had sun ##flower seeds . i love po ##me ##gra ##nate juice though . sounds interesting . do they taste anything like a water ##mel ##on , or more like a ras ##p ##berry ?
i love water ##mel ##on . . . gee ##z - i could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself . my complexion always looks better after water ##mel ##on too
lo ##l ! i know . . my sister hates them . . but i don ' t like most ve ##gg ##ies : ( rap ##sb ##erry ##s are a close second !
why , the odds are not in your favor
ha , its never bad to try though
so what was plan b ?
oh that sounds good .
when is it due out ?
who is your favorite marvel hero ?
that sounds really great and delicious !
oh ##hh ##hh ##h yeah that ' s no good . still that happens to me all the time so i wouldn ' t worry too much about it .
does anything awesome ever end up happening ?
that ' s what ##s up
who did they leave and where ?
wow that ##s crazy .
oh no , i hate that
maybe he comes back or you find him
that sounds creepy
i guess ignore it for now
sounds like a relaxing day .
is it your day off ?
well that comes in handy .
ah . . take it to the bank to find out
that ' s really awesome ! what are you going to be doing with your time ?
well that ' s good ! a little rest and relaxation is always good !
why ##s that ?
excellent
oh no ! where were you coming from ?
yi ##kes ! did you get home okay ? normally i weave different ways when i think that
i am sure tomorrow will be fine
i am sorry , i hope tomorrow is different then
that ' s great that you were so confident . i wish i could be like that .
that ' s great that you have that kind of personal growth
it made him a ton of money so i think that ##s all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap .
that was back then when he was trying to do something great , the drive isn ##t there when you have already done it
that was nice of them .
always good to have friends like that
what pet does she have ?
oh wow . don ' t think i ' ve ever seen one of those .
i get that . i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday . so it ' s hard to find sympathy from me
exactly . it really drives me nuts when people feel like they entitled to this or that .
hmm maybe it ' s not your time yet . . . i ' m sure you ' ll get there
i wish you abundant joy , success health and wealth in all areas of your life .
awesome . that ' s a whole lot ##ta pizza slices .
awesome i hope you enjoy it . don ' t get too fat .
i am so sorry to hear that . who is taking care of your neighbor ?
that ' s really sad . not being able to even know what ' s going on anymore .
i understand ! did you get in trouble ?
good officer for once ! that is good to hear !
oh no ! why was she starved ?
some people should not be in charge of another living being .
rainy ?
yu ##ck
that ' s true . what ' s going on ?
some people are only out for themselves unfortunately .
oh wow ! what does it look like now ?
going to miss who ?
that ##s a nice gift for a cat .
80 % wow that is cool .

that must be frustrating . what are you going to do now ?
i ' m so sorry that happened . what brand is the hd ?
that is nice .
yes . why did you bought that many popcorn kernel ##s ?
dan ##g that stink ##s , better luck next time .
that ##s good that you are trying !
do you know how it happened ?
that sucks . i hate people who do stuff like that and don ' t take responsibility .
that sounds like so much fun - - and like a break you ' re looking forward to , yes ?
have you been before ? it seems like such a great way to both play and get a workout ; - )
that ' s very nice of her !
your brother is a lucky guy !
i am not sure how anyone could like those things
i do not like them either though
that poor dog
that all sounds horrible
did they just not care ?
sometimes they are tired at the end of their shift . it happens
what are you saving up for ?
wow i wish i could be like you : )
why is he missing and is he home ? /
oh god , some dogs have to be watched a lot ! watch the shelters and put up flyers everywhere online
which part
hm that ' s pretty useful info right there . . . you must be quite the handy ##man / woman , i would ' ve probably just bought another one lo ##l
i know right ? i love the side hu ##stle !
no idea what that means but it sounds good ! lo ##l
where do you want to go .
oh wow that sounds cool
what ' s happening next week ?
aren ' t we talking about the kids going back to school ?
i hope the cat likes it
that is great , i am glad you got it
what happened ? was he honest with you ?
u ##gh ! did he offer an explanation yet ?
i think a lot of parents are !
were they a handful over the summer ?
is there anything that can be done to save it
what does she plan to do if she can ##t ?
it happens a lot
was it a long wait
that ##s always nice to have time to sit and relax
good for you .
i am sorry , any reason why ?
i am sorry you are going through that
some drunk ##s are funny , and some are unfortunately annoying as hell .
oh man , all your friends are the annoying drunk ##s ?
you got lucky . i don ' t ever seem to get warnings .
yeah no kidding . you caught a break .
i am happy that you think your interview was successful . i know they can be nerve ##wr ##ack ##ing sometimes .
i am glad to hear it . i hope you get the new job !

that ' s pretty awesome keep grinding
that ##s great ! you are reaching your goals then ?
more information ?
that is very sweet . family is important
i know that feeling for sure
ah man ! you shouldn ' t feel bad about trip ##ping . why do you feel bad about it ?
take it in stride . hum ##ility is a great feature to have !
i get like that , was there a particular reason or just don ' t like it in general ?
that can be scary . we live in the middle of nowhere so i really panic when i hear something . i totally understand
that sounds like fun . what amusement park ?
that is awesome . hope you enjoy yourself
i don ' t have a green thumb myself . what plants are you growing ?
wow . that ' s quite a variety ! those can ##tal ##ou ##pes will be delicious !
interesting . you gonna get new ones
what kind were they
some people don ' t realize it ' s just as easy as being comfortable being yourself to be accepted .
are you gonna have to see this person again ?
hr ##mm , did it grow legs and walk away ?
you probably need to think about setting up a search crew
i think we ' ve all gone through that . how many tickets did you buy ?
that ' s good . not much wasted then .
that sounds great . are you going to go get br ##un ##ch after ?
that ' s usually what i do .

saving money is so important
that is very smart to think about
ye ##a , you definitely need a break every now and then . is it vacation time ?
sounds like you ' re really tired . are you going to make it to the end of the year without a break ?
that is so cool . i loved the old school computers

i am sure you will get it eventually
i hope you do not have to do that
you are a great friend !
well , she ' s very lucky to have you during this tough time for her .
i can imagine . luckily mine don ' t go far when they do
i ' m sure it was a challenge getting him back home , at least you got some exercise ha ##ha
oh no ! why did it take them so long to get back with you ?
that ' s horrible ! did you already have plans made for the trip ? i hope you can work it out with them , but if not maybe finding another job that is a bit more acc ##omo ##dating would be beneficial .
do you mean the biology class was taken at a school ?
wow . that is pretty amazing . did you enjoy it ?
that is nice . would you be buying your cake there ?
i understand . is it close to your home ?
that ' s very kind of you . how long has he lost his job ?

texas . it was in the 90 ' s today .
oh man , that kind of thing would make me furious . do you have any idea who it might have been ?
yeah , i hate it . parents need to start raising their kids better .
i ' m sure they aren ' t though , ha ##ha ##ha ##ha .
i hope the one who doesn ' t want to return at least gets to spend more time with their friends .
you should probably go to the doctor
well it might help you get rid of them a little quicker or find the underlying issue
what ' s your plan ?
aw is he usually cl ##ing ##y ?
what kind of cake was it
i am glad , you deserve a treat every once and awhile

i have that problem too . most feel heavy and make me sweat . i really hope it ' s just right for you
great ! what kind of job and how good of a promotion ?
oh great ! hopefully a nice chunk of change : )
are you going to get the right part ?
i am sure you can find help online
cong ##rat ##s ! what kind of job is it ?
great ! what kind of stuff will you be doing ?
its instinct ##ive . they pretty much know what to do by instinct .
that ' s great to hear . i ' m glad it worked out .
i don ' t really follow players when they get so big that they seem like they are getting too big for their brit ##ches
i used to live in miami and that was a big deal when he was part of the white hot heat
ah yes its always nice to take a moment to remember the past
that ##s wonderful to hear ! take care .
why was it without you ?
well that can ' t be helped . what kind of trip was it ?

ah well in that case that ##s a good move .
what kind of pet was it ?
very cool lizards , i like their beard ##s .
oh wow , i ' m sure she will understand ! my send some nice flowers and a sorry card .

just be careful , i am sure you know what you are doing
i am sure you will be okay
i am glad you go ! what kind of church is it ?
what are they doing tomorrow ?
why did you have to cancel ?
i can understand that - unfortunately some times we have to do those annoying things in order to keep things level .

yes i can ##t wait for it to be over !
ye ##a we have the ac on way too much in the summers
what ' s going on next week ?
oh ye ##a , how could i forget that . how many kids do you have ?

it was in the 90 ' s today

your boss sounds pretty amazing . i want to work with you guys , ha ##ha ##ha .
oh wow , that must be confusing , scary and fu ##stra ##ting !
exactly ! no one is going to take the warnings seriously !
really ? can you explain that more ?
that ' s amazing . i really am impressed for your dog .
aw ##w , that ' s sad . i have been there more than i like to admit .
i ' m sure if he ' s a good brother he will understand . my family is always happy to receive food as a gift because it ' s made with love .
wow that is awesome that you were able to do that
everyone needs to get out in the real world to stay sane !
that is sad . what was the gift she wanted ?
wow , she is asking too much . every kid want a horse .
good life partners are hard to find . you hold on to him .
how long have you two been together ?

yes . be safe . call police in emergency .
oh no , what happened next ?
i ' m glad nothing happened .

that ' s terrible ! you are being nice to try and help her .
hopefully she can find something else quickly so she doesn ' t worry so much
wow that ##s a great score !
hard work pays off as they say .
i actually don ' t know too much about basketball , so i really don ' t have a strong opinion on that . is that a bad thing ?
i guess he ' s confident that he can do well with any team .
that ' s great ! do you have a traditional job or do you work for yourself ?
i know it ' s hard when you ' re not sure if you can make enough money . was there a change that made you feel better about it ?
o really ? how ' d she react to hearing that ?
i ' m sure something really frustrating happened first .
oh my were they able to take it ?
what a fool . where the cops able to catch him ?
that stink ##s . hopefully he won ' t try it again on you or anyone else for that matter .
me either . i ' m sorry you had to go thru that .
yeah that ' s annoying . welcome to the problems of having an at ##ta ##ctive mate .
take it as a compliment .
yes it is . its una ##vo ##ida ##ble though . people suck .
i ' m so sorry , it ' s hard to lose our animals , they become a part of our family .
the pain never really goes completely away , but it does get easier to deal with .
oh ##h , that ' s bad . i feel sorry for her
don ' t worry . she will recover . i will pray for her
why ? did he steal it ? ha ##ha
oh wow , that is low ! hate men like that , that won ' t support their children .
well that is very nice of you . is it a pretty big project ?
that is great . i sure they are very thankful for the le ##p
oh that ##s scary !
im sorry to hear that ! maybe next time it will be better or try another way to travel that is better .
why was she so late , that ##s terrible
i ' m so sorry . i hope she makes it up for her .
oh ##h that ' s nice . lego ##s was one of my favorite games , when i was a kid

he is pretty amazing !
oh wow that does sound scary ! are you okay ? any damage to your home ?
that ' s good ! i know insurance can be a pain to deal with !
wow . it is so nice of him . i am su ##pp ##ris ##sed that the pick up lasted 12 years .
that is a very solid truck that you have .
oh no ! did you have any sort of security cameras to see who did it ?
that ' s horrible . i hope you can find a way to rec ##ou ##p what was lost quickly and move on .
is that a movie ?
oh wow , that certainly sounds like a sad movie for sure !
cool . has it been taking a long time _
i hope to move into a house next year
ou ##ch , was it way worse then normal due to weather ?
that ' s scary , i hate driving in storms .
i bet ! hopefully you can take some time off and go see them soon !
i understand , i ' m sure your family misses you as well . maybe you can meet half way for the holidays .
my kids just started back th ##urs and my new semester starts then too . i definitely understand
i ' m sure it ' ll go fine . usually the ji ##tters are worse than it actually is
were they po ##ka ##y
oh well , i am sure they have moved on
oh ##h good for you . but why is that ?
oh ##h that ' s cool . i have never been there at such place . but , i am happy for you .

i like those as well , what are some of yours
oh that sounds so nice
what is 4 for ?
it was like monsoon weather here too . it ' s de ##pressing and my garden is suffering
that must have been an em ##bar ##sing situation but we ' ve all been there .
ha ##ha i ' m sure it ' ll be a good story to tell and hopefully you can laugh about it now .
that ' s a bum ##mer ! were you upset about it ?
yeah , i can understand that . maybe next time you ' ll get to go and he ' ll have to work !
it must be nice to be rich
i am sorry , just be yourself
o ye ##a ? what kind would that be ?
nice , i love th ##ign ##s like that , so important i feel .
that ' s sad to hear - it ' s hard to find a true good friend . how far away are they moving ?
hopefully you will be able to visit and vice versa - but it ' s never really the same is it ?
i am sorry . i am sure he appreciate ##s you being there for him
its good he has such good care
oh yeah , that was a great feeling to have , especially as a child .
it ' s the same with me and my fin ##ace ##e . we ' ll just go somewhere nice for dinner or something . that childhood magic was the best .
that ' s awesome . i really want to go camping but we haven ' t been able to yet
are you going somewhere local or going out of town ?
that is always fun . enjoy your time .
that would be disappointing . what will you do ?
that ' s too bad . good luck with that .
i bet you are proud of her
sounds like a smart girl
how sweet . what did they do on their special day ?
i get that . i wish we had children so my husband could do that .
in what areas ?
i hope that you all meet and exceed your goals . it ' s great to have goals to work towards .
that sucks , did they just study more or what happened ?
i would be too . well maybe you ' ll get a better grade than him next year
oh that ' s bad . i feel sorry for you .
but don ' t feel de ##jected . your time will come . i pray for your bright future .
i am sorry , are you okay
what kind of car
i bet it is so cute ! what breed is it ?
oh i love those ! well at least you can go over and play with it anytime you want without having to clean up after it lo ##l
is there a way you could go and see him ?
i ' m sorry you won ' t get to see him this weekend - perhaps you can have a nice long phone call or sky ##pe or something to catch up until you can see him again .
that sounds hard
that does sounds sounds to me
you don ##t like your neighbors ?
that is a nice feeling
cool . i haven ' t ben to ch ##rch in a while
i should make time to go though
well cong ##rat ##s ! is it kindergarten ?
mine are in 1st , 6th , and 9th grade this year so i know what you mean .
uh oh . i think everyone does that sometimes .
don ' t be too hard on yourself .
does your boss has thought it is you ?
hopefully , he will forget about it .
i hope that you will get the job that is going to be what is best for you . stay positive .
that is important . like my grandma always tells me " like attracts like " so be what you want to attract to you .
what do you plan on doing with your time off ?
maybe a quick shot to the beach .
what kind of school
i hope you do well
why not ?
that sucks . maybe you can go next weekend
well that ' s mighty convenient , was it delicious ?
what ! it ' s not even a salad without a ton of let ##tu ##ce ! i hope you called and complained !
that ' s great . so you are confident in the progress of it ?
that ' s a great feeling to have . a job well done .
rain can be annoying when it comes to that
hopefully it will be sunny then
how big was it ?
that
that must have been so scary , did you kill him ?
that ' s awful he might be in your house .
that ' s awful . how did it catch on fire ?
that sucks .
do you have home owners insurance ?
i ' m sure it will all work out .
did you enjoy it there ?
that is hard when you are young . my family moved around a lot until i was 13 .
good for you ! how was your first experience ?
i am really happy for you . hope i ' ll be a dad one day .
me too ! this heat in texas is killing me .

oh really ? was it pretty exciting then ?
that sounds like fun . i think you definitely got your money ' s worth .
oh no ! is it close to your house ?

that sounds like a classic car . did you used to ride in it with your dad a lot ?
ha ##ha that ' s awesome ! sounds like you had a fun time with it !
u ##gh they do that at my apartment too . you should put a can outside with a big sign that says " throw your nasty butt ##s here "

have you asked you boss ?
aw ##w , you must have been close to them .
that ' s hard to lose someone so close to you . at least their memory will live on forever with you .
maybe he wants you to work the weekend .
that would be a smart move .
i do not like pizza .
i just do not like the sauce and too much bread .
why not ?
it ' s not fair - but i suppose the opposite view is that if they make enough money then you don ' t need the support that ot ##eh ##r people do .
what happened ? was it that bad ?
i am sure she didn ' t like that .
i ' m sorry to hear that .
do you think there are any reasons for that ?

ha ##ha i know the feeling . is it in the job field that you would want ?
that is such a relaxing fun thing to do . are you going to see something that you ' ve been wanting to watch ?
luckily they have several options . i ' m sure you will find one that will be worth seeing .
oh that sounds scary !
i could only imagine !
was it your first time making it or are you a pro
oh is that something that ##s easy to make ?
what are you going to do with it ?
are you getting anything in particular ?
really ? were you ok in the end though ?
what did you do ?

i hope you are able to f ##nd one soon
you ' re not alone . you ' ve got me
good . i ' m fu ##l of beans
and they are a musical fruit .
i ' m preparing to watch lots of soccer on tv today . you have to prepare fully before attempting this .
where are you that the sun is up already ?
i was there many , many years ago . i ' m in florida now .
rain or high humidity . don ' t like the humidity . how is it there ?
i really liked scotland , the castles and the history .
that is so terrible !
i hope you feel better .
yeah . the times have changed
that is true . i wonder if things will be like those day
oh , no . i hope for nothing to bad .
court is scary i have gone before . do you have to pay a fine ?
why ? what happened ?
that sounds like a really bad friend .
any ideas why ? what were you trying to make ?
i ' m sorry it didn ' t come out well for you .
you sound excited . i can ' t wait for the college season to start .
i hope it ' s a good year for our favorite teams .
were your suspicions correct ?
that sounds amazing ! where was it ?
what was the weather like ?
oh wow , did anyone get hurt ?
yu ##ck , that sounds really gross .
did you ask him why he did it ?
that sounds so sweet !
he must be a great guy !
what kind of job are you looking for ?
have you applied anywhere ?
really what was it ?
that was kind of herr
were you not expecting the new house ?
don ' t you find it more better building your own house ?
why did you feel that way ?
i ' m sorry you didn ' t have an umbrella .
that is true
i missed those days too
yes i certainly have . i know exactly what you are talking about .
that ##s exactly what i was thinking about when you asked me this question . i had the same thing happen .
oh wow . i hope it ' s not going to do any damage !
i hope you ' re prepared for it .
oh , what was it ?
that is my favorite video game !
no , i don ' t have children . do you ?
yeah , it is weird . your son must be really talented .
from your house ?
why wouldn ' t he just go to the store and buy his own ?
oh my go ##sh , that crazy ! i have not eaten there since i was young and lived in texas . i don ##t think we have what ##ab ##urg ##er in missouri .
what a coincidence . i am from texas . soon as you said what ##ab ##urg ##er it brought back memories . im glad you were happy with your food ! ! !
oh no ! what happened ?
that ' s a bum ##mer . it happens to the best of us though !
college is so much fun , you will love it !
i wish you the best of luck !
e ##w ! that must have been so disgusting !
it must have tasted even worse .
that sounds terrifying ! how fast were you travelling ? how old was the car ? what happened ?
was it an old car ? were the brakes somewhat worn ? or was it an out of the blue brake failure ! ? that has to be one the scar ##iest things , i ' m glad you managed to use the emergency brake and stay safe !
4 years in october
mine cheated on me too . we ' re separated now .
were you ? that must have impressed you a lot .
i agree , we should strive to be like that person .
i know how that could be , an old trip down memory lane can make you reflect on so much .
that is wonderful . i think that i will take a look at a few of my photo albums and get that feeling too .
was it a nice surprise ?
i ' m pleased for you . did you go on it ?
do you feel like you are ready to drive in real time ?
i ' m glad you passed though !
what do you have to make it for ? are you looking forward to it ?
that ' s a bum ##mer . hopefully you can find some enjoyment in it .
that ' s so funny ! how did they react when you did that ?
i would ' ve been so embarrassed if that was me . at least you ' ve got a funny story to tell people .
i feel sorry for you , how did you reacted ?
this is normal , maybe you should take so time alone to think about how you really fell about the situation . anger can make you do things that you will regret later .
oh that sound like a lot of fun ! ! hope your date ended up being worth all that work .
confidence is definitely a good things to have when going on a date . i bet your looked great !
that ' s good . great teachers are always needed in this world .
oh no ! did you hurt yourself bad ?
u ##gh ! sounds like a problem . can you find out who it was .
well its best not to think about it too much . being angry will not help at all .
that is so nice of them !
you have some great people at work !
oh that can be annoying ! i guess in her defence it was a saturday night ? but still , it doesn ' t take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late ! i hope you were able to sleep okay .
yeah , like you suggest , it is the little considerations of the other person ' s needs that can make the difference between an okay and a really good flat ##mate .
that is so sad .
yeah , it will take some for the pain to go away .
oh no . i ' m so sorry to hear that . it must have been terrifying ?
i ' m glad you ' re ok
i hope you did well . was it difficult ?
what was the test over ?

that is so cute ! that must make you proud
how did it go ? did you get the job .
that ##s so awesome ! was it in the field you wanted ?
i bet so . i can ' t imagine the difficulty of having to enter a field like that .
division 1 is pretty prestigious . that is very cool , indeed .
wow , that must ' ve been awful ! how did it all turn out ?
that sounds really scary , i ' m so glad it all turned out fine .
it is so nice to have family be able to back you up in a time of need . have you been able to catch up yet ?
that is wonderful ! great wait to start the upcoming holiday season .
not cool ! why did you do that ?
as you should ! you should put back the money that you stole .
why did you do that ?
true , i hope you can fight those urges .
that must be so frustrating
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he stops soon .
oh my , how did you deal with it ? i hope you didn ##t kill it .
good on you . the spider is probably thankful for that . it didn ##t mean to scare you .
i am so sorry that you couldn ##t go as i can see this was so important to you . why did you have to cancel ? must have been something important come up !
im sorry you that happen ##d to you . do you write books ?
was your name on it ?
have you had issues with this worker before ?
oh no , what did it say ?
oh congratulations ! i am so happy for you !
were you guys married ?
are you serious ? that ' s so childish . i wouldn ' t let it bother you even though i know that ##s easier said than done .
good on you for taking that stand ! you must be very proud of yourself
its all down to hard work . you deserve to be there .
i don ' t really follow soccer , but it always cool for an under ##dog to do well .
i do , too . was it their first time to the final ?
that is so cool !
he must be a hard worker !
do you feel nos ##tal ##gic about it ? if they were good memories .
yep , childhood was the best time . its best to remember these things every now and then .
oh , no i " m sorry to hear that .
i would have done the same thing . some people have no respect .
yep those are the most exciting times of life .
it must have been the best feeling in the world . i am glad you felt it too .
that ' s great . is it very nice ? i ' ve never been in one of those before .
how many people does it hold ? i have five kids so we have a mini ##van .
she must have a lovely voice !
you must be a great parent !
did you have your alarm on
oh wow , i would have thought maybe an animal had gotten in
yes one time . i was feeling very hopeful that day . have you ?
oh my , sorry to hear that . i am sure there is another job out there for you .
how long were you deployed for . and thank you for your service .
in the medical clinic i bet quiet nights were ok .
oh my goodness , i ' m sorry ! i have a dog and two cats .
that says a lot about your spouse , when losing your pet is worse .
cool ! getting a new phone is like christ ##ma !
that is a pretty good girlfriend to buy you a new phone .
oh that ' s nice of them ! i hope you had a good time at the party !
o ##oo wine , a class ##y bunch of folk you are !
i seem you must be quite proud of her for writing on such a subject .
i agree , high quality work deserves to be read by a broader audience .
i sure hope so . why do you think that it will be a good day ?
yep , it sounds like you are starting your day off on the right foot . hope mine goes as well as yours seems to be going so far .
you must have been so impressed . they must have been quite talented .
i wish i could dance like that ! too bad i am only good with computers !
oh that sounds awful ! what did you do ?
at least once it ' s over , it ' s over . i would consider other airlines next time ! i would also write a complaint letter .
are you good at doing flat ##pack di ##y ?
cool
that must have been exciting .
i am very happy for you .
i have . it ' s definitely awful . it ' s much like losing a family member .
oh no ! what a horrible thing to happen . i ' m sorry to hear that .
wow , what a good moment you had . what did you take as your meal ?
ha ##ha ##ha ha ##ha ##ha , u can see that you like good things . i missed that with you .
are you excited about something ?
you must be very hungry
why would you do that ?
oh wow , have you ever thought about getting help ?
yes and it was the worst experience of my life . have you ?
oh my , i hope you don ##t feel scared living alone
oh , what is the race ? sounds like a lot of work !
i ' m sure all the work will be worth it in the end !
cool ! what style of music ?
ah i ' ve heard of them , they used to be played on some of the local rock stations . love a tour t - shirt , always means you might make a friend if you wear it out as other fans are bound to compliment you !
ha . was it ge ##ice ?
how much did you save ?
yes , it is terrifying !
oh thank goodness it was nothing serious .
that ' s frustrating . how on earth do you ever get something done ?
it would make sense . if you two are doing the same work job , it ' s only fair that you evenly divide the house ##work as well .
what type of work do you do ?
yes , it ' s like that all the time for me .
that is great . i stress myself out over things and i think by doing that it makes things worse .
that is very true . congratulations on passing your test .
oh , goodness . why did you do such a thing ?
maybe next time ask her . i hope you pay her back when you can .
ex ##cat ##ly ! i would love to know what they spend it all on
yu ##p , they cheat the system and then get a huge ref ##und back
that is terrible . are you going to take of her ?
why not asking her to move to your home ?
wow , that sounds intense . what were some of the features it had ?
that does sound scary ! i hope you at least enjoyed it a little !
yes cruises are awesome . i am sure you will enjoy it .
nice , hopefully you many good writers and keep in touch with them !
you must be excited !
nice . im sure you will have lots of fun doing it .
do you still talk to the people you went with .
where did you guys hike ? did you stay over night
yeah i guess that happens every once in a while . something you went through recently ?
oh that ' s too bad . i ' m assuming you didn ' t win ?
not particularly . i wasn ' t my best self at that time . i suppose who really is , though .
at least you had a good experience . i definitely feel you on the responsibilities part !
you must be really excited for it .
i agree , there are great ways to buy unique things
that was nice of them to chip in . it must have felt good that you had someone to help .
that ' s wonderful . it makes all the difference to have people you can trust , especially when you are not feeling well .
that is nice . do you like fishing ?
i am not a big fan but i go fishing once or twice a year .
that ' s great . how big is the bonus going to be ?
that would help me out quite a bit too !
oh no ! is everything ok ? i hope he didn ##t scare you
im sure your very worried . please get help and call the police . i know it can be nerve ##wr ##eck ##ing .
that sounds so good and the perfect way to spend a sunday .
are you going to a restaurant or making it yourself ?
yes , i loved him . have you ?
it must have been very devastating . but remember him for all the good times .
did you get tickets ? or getting ready for your li ##cea ##se ?
that ' s awesome ! good luck i ' m sure you will do great .
hopefully it brought back good ones . were you close to them ?
it ' s good you have those great memories , though !
no , do you have one really sick pet ?
did you to ##ke her to a vet ?
are you serious ? why wouldn ' t you pay him back .
oh wow , i would have called the police .
did he do something bad ?
it ' s a tough situation . did you call him after ?
that must have been quite the surprise .
that is so crazy !
that sounds like a smell ##y situation .
i hope you get that cleaned up .
was he a competition eater ?
that ' s pretty impressive . i don ' t think i could manage that . ,
oh man ! you must be sad . have you been bad lately ?
i can see how your frustrated . maybe you can talk to your dad about it .
a workout program ?
i ' m a division 1 strength coach .
its good to feel good about yourself
its a very confident attitude
no unfortunately . have you ?
i agree , but i also enjoy my independence .
football , soccer or american football
do you play on a professional team ?
oh no ! hopefully you ' re able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again .
that ' s quite a bum ##mer !
you must be excited . packing can be he ##ctic . thank god you are organized .
i agree . you should double check everything to make sure its there . it will help with the worry and anxious ##ness about it .
and what was this thing ?
i see , you must be very prepared and talented to compete in such a thing .
oh wow ! cong ##rat ##s , i know the process my husband did one . what is your on ?
yes ! what un ##iver ##is ##yt it it form
i ' m sorry to hear that . is it a total loss ?
are you going to replace it with a similar year / model ?
oh my , why can ' t they just set a time and commit to it ?
i agree , you should talk to your friend to be more committed to the plans .
well that sucks but at least it seems like you have a decent support system ?
yeah make sure he knows that !
did everything went as planned ?
i understand . did you planned it another time ?
wow that ##s amazing . you must be excited and full of joy !
i can agree how you can feel amazed about . maybe i will get one so i can be amused just like you .
that ' s awful . it ' s a shame that there ' s still racist people in 2018 !
i would have done the same thing .
yes , i lit ##ke that too . do you do that frequently ?
i understand .
that is awful ! you should file a complaint !
i would see if you can es ##cala ##te it . talk to the corporate level .
that sucks . i hope you won ' t be out of transportation
i bet ! they ' re really cool cars with personality
oh those definitely sound like some good memories ! at least you have some pictures .
i ' m sure they would enjoy that quite a bit . they can make memories just like you did .
i do like them but i haven ' t been on that many , unfortunately .
oh no are you alright ?
well , just never go back to that bar and make all new friends !
glad to hear you ' re feeling better again . how did you hurt it ?
that sucks . maybe you need to be a bit more careful until its fully healed .
i feel for you , but don ##t take it the hard way , its well
that ##s what you should do
i am sorry you have had back luck . there are some honest people out there .
i know , it is true . you just have to try to focus on the good , i suppose .
that is a really exciting time . you must be so proud .
i know it ' s hard when they first go off for college , but it sounds like you raised her well .
oh that ' s amazing ! is it a novel ?
how long did it take to write ? i always admire the st ##amina of people who can write a book .
oh i ' m sorry . i hope you weren ' t hurt !
that ' s okay . it happens to everyone !
i know it ' s a blow , but you ' re only human . everybody makes mistakes sometimes .
i ' m sorry . people can be greedy and une ##mp ##ath ##etic .
i ' m very happy for you , thank god you could get a job , that ' s good !
i imagine it was very complicated for you when you did not have a job , that happened to me once and i felt very distressed .
that is nice . how many brothers and sisters do you have ?
nice .
sounds like a real example of learning from the past . sorry you had to go through that . are you better now ?
sounds like your ##e in a good place . congratulations !
that ' s so funny , i was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday ! i love races - if you are talking about horse races . and good memories are the best .
did they used to take you ? they can be so exciting .
that ' s great ! that is wonderful luck !
that is wonderful . i hope you have a great time !
so you definitely believe in the old ada ##ge : fail to prepare and you prepare to fail ?
that sounds like a very sensible philosophy .
that is so nice of them ! what did they bring you ?
it sounds delicious ! what a good friend .
that sounds like fun . did you see any lions ?
what else do you see besides li ##oin ##s ?
oh my ! you must have been terrified about it ! did you get it fixed ?
im sure it was very scary for you . your such a brave person with al ##ot of courage to do so .
wow ! that is a very expensive car ! did they win the lottery or something ?
yeah . must be a smooth ride . lucky guy !
that ' s not good . can ' t you with ##hold if they refuse to fix the leak ? i would be really mad !
that is true about the waste . i would sue for compensation . i think the law is on your side regarding this issue .
that is great . that is a big worry off your shoulders i ' m sure .
i am glad to hear it . it is a lot more productive to focus on the future than the past .
that is great . they noticed you because you are doing a good job ,
good luck with that .
who felt left out ? i ' m con ##fu ##ed ?
that ' s unfortunate , what did she end up doing ?
what did u do with it afterwards ?
ok , that ##s a lot better
oh that ' s not fun ! i hope it cleared when you took it out !
it should have cleared it . i once left bread for two weeks when i went home for winter vacation .
that ' s so cool ! you must be proud . i ' m terrible at hu ##la hoop ##ing
it takes a lot more skill than it appears to !
wow , congratulations ! are you nervous ?
awesome ! i hope it goes smoothly and that everything works out great for you !

no . there ' s definitely something wrong if they won ' t call a pest control company .
that is nice . how many children ##s do you have now ?
congratulations .
that is great . good job .
nice .
that sounds frustrating , especially if they are inc ##ons ##ider ##ate and drain you of your funds . they sound kind of entitled .
oh wow , that must be embarrassing to deal with . sounds like they are going through a financial situation , but they should at least talk to you about it since you two are friends .
that ' s great ! i hope you have lots of fun and don ' t get too bitten by mosquito ##es
don ' t forget marsh ##mal ##low ##s !
wow . that was un ##cal ##led for . i am sorry to hear about that . sounds like she is not someone you would want to date anyway
do not let it get you down . there are plenty of people out there who are jerk ##s .
that is terrible . how much did it cost you to fix it ?
i understand . does the grocery store have outside some camera ?
oh no ! it can be annoying especially early mornings at work with no coffee . hope you stay away !
sounds fr ##ust ##era ##ting . i hope your next one is more depend ##able .
that ' s not good ! i ' m assuming they got it back on for you ?
i bet it was ! that ' s pretty quick for them to get the power back on actually . in my city it would take a full day .
i be you can ##t wait ! seeing exotic animals is so exciting !
this will be fun ! i bet your full of joy right now !
im excited for you ! enjoy your day !
that is so scary ! did they catch him ?
i ' m pleased to hear that , the security guard sounds brave . still , it must have been very stress ##ful !
that sounds awful ! did they fix the order ?
i don ' t think i would ever order from that place again !
yi ##kes , i would ' ve been freaking out . how did you handle it ?
ha ##ha i would have run too !
that ' s so nice . . . almost a decade !
very happy for you ! to many more !
awesome first date ! hopefully it goes well for you .
what ' s your favorite exhibit at the zoo ?
oh my . i bet you were a nervous wreck . how did you find your cat ?
i am glad he is back home and safe again . you must be relieved .
that ' s awful ! especially in the middle of summer !
were you able to afford it ?
that ' s amazing
i wish i can win like you , i have never won anything before
you have to give your spot to someone else ? what do you mean exactly ?
that ' s unfortunate but , an emergency is an emergency .
that is great ! are you nervous about whether or not you will get into med school ?
that ' s good to know ! i would be super excited if i were you !
that ' s frustrating ! we have cat scratching posts everywhere to try to avoid that , but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching
cats are always getting into things they shouldn ' t , but i still love them
what did you do there ?
that sounds like a lot of fun ! i have never been there
awesome , i love breakfast ! what did you have ?
ah , such a classic breakfast ! you can ' t really go wrong with that .
you must be proud . did her team win the game ?
impressive . is she looking forward to her next game ?
that is the worst ! did you have somewhere you needed to be ?
that stink ##s ! hopefully you are not to mad because of it . flat tires happen to the best of us !
that ' s awesome ! it ' s always good to catch up with an old buddy .
hopefully he hasn ' t changed too much and you guys still have similar interests !
that sounds wonderful ! i ' m sure you
i am sure you will get there , i meant to say . don ' t rush or settle and i am sure you will find something perfect . we bought our first house on friday !
great ! what was it about ?
oh how cool ! did you go alone or with your family ?
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that .
oh dear . well next time you are at the store , get two cart ##ons !
its always good to be prepared . i live in an area that gets hurricanes too . i ' ve even got a generator .
last hurricane i was without power for a whole month . it was miserable .
oh no ! i have had that happen too ! it was very embarrassing !
yes ! did you notice after a short time ?
oh , i ' m sorry you had that experience . when i was traveling cross - country , i used to face ##time or sky ##pe friends and family . would that work for you ?
that ' s very true . another thing i did was find a trader joe ' s or some sort of store and stock up on decent food . eating alone ' s no fun , but at least you ' re safe and no ##uri ##shed !
i would be so scared to sky dive ! how nervous were you before the jump ?
i ' m glad you didn ' t pass out ! i don ' t know if i would be able to go through with it .
congratulations on that . what are her plans now ?
i hope she would find one as it seems now the economy is really competitive
that ' s very sad . are you planning on going to syria to help them ?
it could end today if everyone came to an agreement .
you must have prepared yourself for this ! you will do great !
great preparation indeed !
that must have been scary ! how are you feeling ?
i wouldn ' t want to be either that sounds terrifying !
that is great . was it a scratch ##er ticket ?
i bet . that was a great surprise i am sure . enjoy your vacation !
how fr ##ust ##era ##ting ! have you brought it up to management
i can tell the fr ##ust ##eration in your tone . i would go above your supervisor since nothing has been done . otherwise you will stay frustrated and angry .
wow ! i don ##t know what else you can do . your at a dead end right now . how annoying !
i know how you feel . i would be fur ##ui ##ous .
are you nervous ?
i do too ! i ' m always worried i ' m going to throw up !
i hate when parents don ' t keep tab ##s on their kids , especially when they are mis ##be ##ha ##ving ! what did you do ?
at least you did the right thing and didn ' t yell at the kid yourself .
i wish you the best of luck !
there are many types of loans out there , so hopefully you get one ! it will also help you build your credit .
i bet your anxious to know what happens
wow ! i bet you were so happy for her . i can tell by the joy in your words
who says un ##real things ?
yes that happens but , i ' m not really understanding the context of your comment . . .
relaxation is very need ##ful
yes , its well deserved , very wr ##lco ##med
yeah its very ne ##r ##v ##wr ##eck ##ing . im anxious as well to know how it turns out .
yeah makes me nervous to know what and how it will turn out . hopefully everything will turn out good for the best .
that must have taken some preparation ! how did you feel afterwards ?
i wouldn ' t be able to move the next day ! i hope you rewarded yourself after all of that hard work !
an id for glue ? what ' s next , showing id for buying a greeting card ? she ##esh .
i can see that . i guess this is why we can ' t have nice things .
know the feeling . i had one job where i spent all day either playing cards or working online , just to relieve the boredom !
is there any way you can do something else during down time , or do you have to be available immediately if it gets busy ?
i ' m sorry . what type of job do you do ?
me too . my phone was a help to play online games if i was totally losing it ! and sneaking out for a walk helped too !
whoa ! that ' s awesome ! i ' ve never won anything in my life lo ##l
i bet ! what did you do with all the money ?
oh no ! did you ever find him again ?
i am sorry to hear that . maybe he will find his way back home some day .
why did you lose contact ? what happened ?
that ' s very sad , i ' m sorry to hear that
why alone
so where did you sped the time alone ?
that sounds like fun who are you going with ?
i am sure you will enjoy it .
oh that sounds like fun ! what types of food do you cook ?
food always makes the party !
wow ! how content you must feel about it !
that must have made you feel happy ! i can tell !
i ' m so sorry to hear that . losing family can be , and is , very tough .
that ' s all you really can do . i hope you find that you heal in time .
the irony that the internet bill could not be paid online is kind of funny . but i can see how that would be a let down and inc ##on ##ven ##ient .
that is good . i like to pay most of my bills online too
w ##he ##w , you ' re brave ##r than i am .
i hope it all goes okay for you . trust your instincts about doing it or not .
really , what happened ?
wow , i bet that was pretty interesting to look through and remember those days gone by . i hope the re ##mini ##sc ##ing was all good memories .
i ' m sure that is definitely not true . what makes you think that ?
those type of people are really difficult to deal with . i hope he is open to change .
being anxious is normal ! be yourself and you will be just fine !
you will be fine ! don ##t over ##thi ##nk . just make it a happy day .
im sorry to hear that ! are they trying to shame or em ##bar ##ras ##s you about something .
you seem like a trusting guy . there are not too many of those these days
were you embarrassed or what happen ##d ?
i know ! it can be sentimental at times ! you will grow along with them . enjoy the ride
oh no . what happened ?
he didn ' t punish you . . . he punished himself ! that makes no sense
that ' s great . what do you have going on ?
well that ' s good to hear !
oh no that ' s terrible ! i ' m sorry you had to go through that . pets are our family .
i ' m sorry . i hope memories of your dog bring you comfort .
do you like it ?
well , if you don ' t , you won ' t be the only one .
oh no that ' s bad . did she take any medicine ?
hmm maybe try some prop ##olis . that works for me , and i have horrible all ##er ##gies .
really ? that was cool
that is kind of them
that ##s so good , am happy for you
wa ##o , you are so favoured , are u back already ?
did you feel bad about it ?
sometimes we do things that we don ' t regret at the moment but do later on down the road .
oh no - what happened ?
we ' ve lost several with our girls over the years . i understand .
hopefully you do good on those and the doctor clears you .
you will be okay and get better .
what was a snake doing there ?
i don ' t like snakes either
what ? why would she say that ? that ' s mean
like what ? you think she wanna do something bad to you or your brother ?
you don ' t like reading alone ?
yes , i can understand that . i ' m sorry you don ' t have anyone to read with . hopefully that will change in the near future .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that , you seem upset about it .
oh wow , i misunderstood what cheating meant in this context . you can always bounce back and red ##eem your diet .
there will surely be mag ##go ##ts on that when you get home .
i ' ll never go to your house in that shape .
i agree ! especially the green ones .
my husband always says alcohol makes them acceptable . lo ##l
i would have cried for hours .
i hate spiders and frogs , and snakes .
i love pizza ! what is you favorite type ?
why do you say that ? it can ' t be that bad for you , right ?
i try to eat the most junk food possible .
i think i will most likely die before i am thirty .
oh no that is terrible . i ' ve had that happen once . did you find him ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i know pets are just like family .
did the vet fix the dog ?
my dog is also like family to me , so i understand .
that ' s funny ! i agree and it ' s worse when they aren ' t your kids .
to each their own . i have 3 and to be honest , i ' m glad they are getting older . babies suck .
i would have had a great time eating your food .
i do not eat chicken , but i would have loved the brisk ##et !
i agree , that was a really scary one ! i think it was much creep ##ier than average horror movies .
how long did it take you to not be scared around your own apartment anymore ?
wow , it really stuck with you a long time .
sounds like a good night . what movie was it ?
that ' s a perfect way to end the day .
that happens more often that you might think . just because it ' s expensive doesn ' t mean it ' s any good .
yep , probably would have been happier at some hometown diner .
oh yeah , i hate that too . it ' s so inc ##on ##ven ##ient to be closed when people have time to go there .
i agree . it ' s about time society caught up .
i ' m glad you ' re ok ! it ' s sunday , i ' m ok too !
totally . i ' m not working today . how about you ?
ye ##a have fun
ok you have a great ##e time enjoy
indeed . are you religious then ?
i was raised in a presbyterian church in scotland , but haven ' t been to church in a while . perhaps i should go . which church do you attend ?
i bet ! i wanna go on vacation too ! it ' s been a while . where are you guys going ?
i ' ve been to florida once . i went to universal and adventure island parks . so much fun ! i hope you guys enjoy your time there
wow - can you ask them to tone it down at all ? that would drive me crazy !
that is just crazy , they should not disrupt the complex like that .
that ' s good to have friends you can count on ! what kind of party are you having ?
nice ! happy bela ##ted birthday : ) i hope you had a wonderful time with your friends
that always makes it a great night when your team wins !
you should have placed a bet since you were so confident . you could have won a bundle .
it is always good to have a friend who can take your hand in times of need . i wish i had more of that type of friends
will you also have his back ?
i need to start saving more money honestly .
i like to spend money on food al ##ot .
u ##gh , i absolutely hate it when that happens !
it ' s so frustrating ! my dog is elderly so it ' s been happening more .
that must be very painful for both him and you .
that sounds better than i had thought .
that is not good . why do you think it won ' t come ?
that is true . i have lost packages in the past .
i wish i could afford a vacation like that .
one day i ' ll try one of those .
yes he will .
he ' s a beautiful reason to get up
is she still with you ?
she will always be with you .
maybe they just have better taste ?
you can get good looks for cheap ! look at second hand clothes , i ' ve bought lots of designer stuff used .
i would have cried right there .
i can barely walk much less imagine that .
so what do you have for example ?
oh , that must be pleasant to remember the good days with .
why is that exactly ?
i try to forget about how bad it really all is .
ok , how do u combine it ?
wa ##o , that ##s good , it s so refreshing
i am very confused , i hope one day they will .
keep talking to them and they will make sure you go first .
that must be very hard for you all , but i ' m sure it will be worth it in the end . what ' s the exam for ?
that ' s fantastic news ! congratulations to all of you - him for working so hard and passing , and you for being so patient and understanding .

good for you . is it truly your first time flying on a plane ?
one advice . don ' t freak out when the plane go through some turbulence . it is normal and will only last for couple of minutes
ou ##ch ! that is not good ! think of the bright side though . better opportunities may present themselves to you !
don ' t think that way ! there is always something to look forward to !
was your dog ok ? i hope it didn ' t run away .
that is awful and i bet your husband feels really bad . i would be really mad though .
you mean you stole it or they gave it to you ?
that ' s not good ! that ' s stealing . if you needed money you should ' ve just asked them for it . you need to tell them what you did
i would have screamed .
you should have checked the entire house !
wow , what a show off . would you say they are nice ##r by a large margin ?
okay i see your point , i think they make really eye catching shoes .
i ' m really sorry for your loss . at least they still live on through your memories .
that ' s really awesome . they sound like amazing people .
i don ' t think i know who rodney danger ##field is but hey , good for you ! it ' s awesome when people have a good sense of humor
i need to google him . i ' ve never even heard that phrase lo ##l
that ' s cool . do you have a photo album you keep them in ?
oh ok that ' s a good idea .
the gym always hurts my body when i go .
i hate that feeling so much .
well , it ' s time for a wash then .
come on , you can do it .
summer fly ##s by , i hope winter lasts a long time .
the winter is where i spread my wings and grow .
seems like you were well prepared , did you pass ?
that ' s a very complicated way to say november .
did you get out and kick them ?
i have bad road rage .
i am looking forward to trying to get pregnant by the end of the year
really ? we have been trying for 6 years so it ' s been difficult
i do not think that i want kids .
well i am sure many people do not want to have kids .
i ' m sorry . i know how that feels .
your previous conversation . no worries . i love disney haven ' t been in 10 years but i love it
how come what do you mean ?
confusion runs deep in me .
that ' s really great for you ! some people say that praying helps solve anything
that ' s very true !
i ' ll always talk to you .
i ' ll always be for you .
do you still have the cat ?
that ' s great to hear ! i ' m glad you kept him around !
i hate when that happens ! i stu ##b my toes all the time i ' m surprised i didn ' t break none of them yet
good thing is they heal pretty fast and you don ' t need a cast or anything like that
i wish you the best of luck , study hard and you ' ll do well !
i remember cal ##c ii , it can be difficult , but if you practice it ' s not so bad .
good for you . what class was it ?
i am not really good at chemical science and had much difficulties during high school . enjoy your moment . you deserved it
that sounds amazing . i haven ' t seen my family in almost 2 years
i do but they won ##t come visit and i can ' t afford to go visit
i ' m sorry to hear that . why don ' t you join some groups so you can meet some new people .
sometimes you just have to reach out to people . often ##time ##s other people are feeling the same way and you don ' t even realize it .
what happened to cause the change .
oh , okay . take good care of him and he ' ll always love you .
that is great , i " m sure you ' ve worked very hard for it .
i ' m so glad they are recognizing you for all your efforts . it feels so nice to be commended for a job well done .
heck yeah ! i loved that game on the n ##64 , we used to play it all the time in college !
i ' ll be sure to check this out ! my brother has a switch i can " borrow " !
that sounds like a lot of fun , will you be cooking stuff too ?
sounds like a wonderful day - long event , hope you enjoy it !
that sounds like a wonderful time . i wish i had the time for that !
that ' s very true .
i would feel guilty too if i was in your shoes . did you feel bad because you stole or bad because you got caught ?
then why did you do it ?
that is a great attitude to have and wonderful that you are so supportive of them .
some people get jealous when other people are doing well , so you are true ##ly a good friend
that ' s awesome ! i can say that it ' s ag ##rea ##t feeling to graduate .
yeah , but now you can go out and make your mark in the real world .
i bet , i get home sickness even if i ' m gone a couple day . i bet they are happy to see you as well !
hope you guys celebrate and eat something good for dinner tonight !
that ' s awesome does she live far away or just super busy all the time ?
are you going to dinner together or something ?
oh ? and hopefully they did not !
yeah , i can see that ! not much you can do though to prevent it . except for living as healthy as possible !
wow , how exciting . are you going to go ?
you can get the pills , the patch or that bracelet to help .
that is great ! what game did you play ? was it fun ?
what do you do in that game ?
that is nice . was the quilt passed down to you from her ?
that is great to keep things that remind us of our loved ones
i know that nos ##tal ##gic feeling . time really flies .
absolutely , that makes me want to go look at some pictures .
oh that sounds disgusting . have you talked to him about it ?
oh no ! i would be trying to find another place if i were you , or tell him to find one !
that must be stress ##ful ! \
well if you study hard i ' m sure you will do fine .
i can understand . ultimately you don ' t have to be rich to have a kid though
true . well , whatever you decide to do i wish you the best !
that is very ir ##res ##pon ##sible from your side . it is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure
that is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
i love physics !
no , that is normal .
i didn ' t go to the gym forever ! i know how you feel though
i know . i had an anxiety when i first started coming to the gym . i didn ' t know how to use a couple of machines so i stayed on tr ##ad ##mill the whole time
oh no , when did this happen ? do you think you ' ll find him ?
that ' s sad , i ' m sorry to hear that !
my family was over all weekend and we had a blast .
my family is my whole world .
that ' s really great ! i ' m so happy for you !
well i think you will make a great parent . congratulations !
oh wow , what team was you watching ?
oh wow ! personally i am a fan of the falcons .
oh my god . that ' s so scary !
yeah i can imagine . i would be moving out right away !
disgusting ! i hate rodents !
i hope you don ' t either ! if you do , you may need an ex ##ter ##mina ##tor , or a cat !
i love cats ! does your cat like to s ##nu ##ggle with you ?
that is so cute ! we have a cat too but he stays outside on the farm . he is best friends with our chickens !
so sorry to hear about your mom - i do hope she ' s better now . in my personal experience , you can watch and advise all you like , but they often won ' t listen - my mom was like that .
please don ' t be so hard on yourself . it ' s sometimes hard to remind ourselves that our parents are people in their own right and , while we care very much about them , at the end of the day they ' ll do what they think is right .
exactly ! you have to do your thing and she has to do hers . just by being there if she needs help , you ' re doing so much for her !
you are very welcome . i ' ve been there : )
that ' s great , it ' s very useful to have a friend who can bail you out in a time of need .
definitely help her out if you are ever able , if she needs anything !
that ' s great because you really grew as a person .
maybe later on you will be able to handle greater responsibilities .
lo ##l that ' s a really good thing to not have in a diet !
no ##oo you quit ##ter ! ! ! ! j ##k ##jk treat yourself !
did he give you a chance to tell your side of the story ?
he does not sound like someone who is good to work for . i ' m sorry to hear about his ignorance toward you .
that sounds so fun and relaxing ! did you enjoy yourself ?
that sounds so gross ! i am so sorry , i hope you got a ref ##und !
i ' m sorry that you are missing them . maybe you can go home and see them soon ?
yeah i really do too .
great to hear . i love the new car smell . take good care of it .
hope it lasts a long time for you . i am sure you will enjoy it .
oh no ! that ' s an extremely common thing to happen . did you recover ?
sorry to hear that . you ' ll get it next time i ' m sure !
oh no ! i ' m so sorry .
yeah , but i ' m sure no one else would remember it later .
that ' s great , you probably worked very hard so you deserve it .
i ' m definitely a bit jealous , guess i need to work harder .
awe ! was that recently ?
that ' s aw ##some ! cong ##rat ##s !
nice ! what kind of job is it ? are you going to be a manager ?
dan ##g ! hook me up with a job !
i boarded a flight to my destination , while on board i requested a particular drink , and it was declined
for fl ##im ##sy reason , it must be an attitude problem
who was not polite ?
hopefully you don ' t have to go through anything like that again .
that is great news ! i ' m sure you are excited ! congratulations to you two !
i bet you two will have a long and great marriage !
you make it out of wood or is it one of those aluminum ones ?
good for you . there ' s nothing quite like the sense of pride ass ##oca ##ited with building something !
ah , i ' m sorry to hear that , is it for work or something else ?
that does suck , well maybe you guys can work something out to see each other every so often .
i hope so , is your car in bad shape ?
just a month ? not that long to wait , but better be careful in the meantime so you won ' t be left somewhere far from help .
wow , heard that is a tough test , good luck and i ' m sure you are prepared .
good luck , and a future congratulations on killing it !
that ' s awful . where ' s she staying now ?
i ' m glad she ' s got you to look after her .
that sounds so relaxing !
i hope you enjoy it !
that ' s awesome , reading is my favorite past time as well . what book ?
oh i ' ve read that , that is a really good book , i even enjoyed the movie as well .
maybe you should talk with him about how you feel ?
well at least you can say you tried . sometimes teenagers need to figure it out on their own .
that is so , so sad . are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again ?
it is very difficult , but i ' ve see marriages recover from that position - but it takes years to build up that trust again properly . i wish them all the best
oh gross , you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick , so that you won ' t be around to help clean it up .
i ' m sorry , maybe a nose plug would come in handy
as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood
we can ##t win them all , but work always comes first
how ' d it taste ? and what kind of cake was it ?
well , look at the bright side - you got a cake for the anniversary of you becoming a parent to your daughter , and your daughter still gets cake . i kinda think everyone wins there !
that sounds really great ! what movie are you going to see ?
it really is ! i hope that you have a good time !
that ' s pretty sc ##um ##my , has he always been like that ?
you should have a talk with him and let him know how you feel .
no way ! that ' s gross
i hope they at least fixed it for you !
that sounds so fun !
that is great ! i ' m sure they will enjoy it like you did !
very good . you must be handy around the house - i ' m useless ! lana ##is are wonderful - and necessary in many places !
smart move . wish i could do stuff like that . you should be very proud of yourself : )
i think you should take the rest of the day of and relax in your new lana ##i . you can sit and bas ##k in the glory of a job well done !
is this your first ?
that ##s awesome are you having it ?
uh oh . what happened ?
that was a sweet surprise . is everything okay now ?
don ' t think that well ! as long as you are prepared , you will do great !
ah , yeah , i struggled with that too , but if you try hard enough you will get through it .
that sounds like a lot of fun . do you live in the country ?
awesome , you will have a blast . make sure to stay safe .
that is adorable ! i bet you were proud !
aw ##w ##w ! that ' s great !
oh no i hope she ' s ok ! ?
lo ##l pour water on it next time . always does the trick !
i ' m not su ##pr ##ised . i always did that as a kid .
yeah the only way he will learn is if he figures it out by himself .
aw ##w ##w , that ' s sweet ! he was lucky to find such a great partner !
oh no ! you can ' t do that to your friend ! you ' ll find the right single person in time !
the perfect person for you will come soon enough
stay positive !
yu ##m ! what type of food was it ?
i love burger ##s ! you ' re making me hungry !
i would be upset too . you need to sit down and talk to him about it
you ' re a good parent . keep up a good work
please call the police , its called noise abuse
that ##s what you have to put up with with the wrong neighbors
aw , can ' t fit any classes into your schedule ?
oh congratulations , you must be smart !
aw , that ' s awesome . the training paid off and i bet she feels really proud !
ha ##ha , i bet , when she becomes a pro you can say you ' ve been her fan since day one !
i hope you got a warrant ##y on it . new cars should not have issues for a while .
well perhaps you got a lemon . i would ask for a new car if it happens again .
oh no ! i hope that you are getting better !
that ' s awesome that you have such a great partner !
isn ' t it fun to think of times like that . when you were free of most res ##pon ##si ##bil ##ites ?
what year did you graduate ?
that is great that they are willing and able to help .
i bet that was such a relief for you guys !
oh wow i bet you were really proud ?
i ' m sure he will ! best of luck to him !
that ' s the worst , when they take forever . . have you called them up ?
yeah , i understand , they should at least give you a discount !
i feel jealous i didn ' t get the artistic genes my brother got lo ##l
probably ! makes me feel better now lo ##l
that ' s really awesome ! you are a really lucky person !
that ' s so awesome . i wish my god ##mot ##her did that !
that is awesome . i am sure she will do great .
and think one day she may be able to save your life ha ##ha .
oh i can relate , that happened to me with uber ##ea ##ts a couple days ago . its so frustrating !
yeah its the worst when they don ' t own up to it , makes me want to use the competitors service just to spite them . very annoying .
oh no ! at least you noticed now
yes and also explain to them you noticed you were doing it . they ' ll understand
how many slices did you ate ?
that ' s a lot for anyone , lo ##l
i ' ve done this before ! it can be very nos ##tal ##gic to see old friends that you haven ' t seen in awhile . did it bring back any particular memories ?
you could always make a col ##lage with your favorite pictures !
i sort of have . i worked like crazy to get a work visa for the us , so i could be with the person i wanted to spend my life with . it paid off , so i can kind of understand what you ' re saying .
scotland . it ' s quite a process getting in here , despite what some people try to tell you ! what happened with you ?
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
well stay focused and work hard ! you got this !
maybe you could get out and meet some new people .
sounds like a plan .
yeah arcade ##s are pretty sweet . i like that some of them have bars in them now .
i ' m not surprised . it also helps me play better !
congratulations and i ' m sure you will do fine . do you think you will enjoy doing it ?
it ' ll be a good experience at the very least , good luck !
who are you talking about ?
that is sad . why would he gossip ! that ' s so low
that could be so hard on you
just keep your mind occupied with other important stuff
cong ##rat ##s ! is this your first child ?
i think you will do fine ! you will be in love at first sight for your !
congratulations , she must be a quick one , i was always the slow one at the back of the pack .
wow , that ' s impressive , she might get a scholarship one day !
i imagine , that must be so awful . have you had that before ?
i hope the doctor can help you get the pain away !
aw , that ' s sweet , i ' m glad you love her so much !
that ' s good , no body should ever cheat in my opinion ! at least end the relationship first .
oh my god . that ' s awe ##ful !
well he sounds really ir ##res ##pon ##sible . i would make him pay for the damages .
tell me about it , they have to be in my top 5 things i hate the most .
plus they are so small it ' s harder to kill them for me . flies are larger so i have an easier time getting rid of them .
u ##gg ##h , what a buzz ##kill .
i ' d say that is definitely true for you now .
ok and how does that work
that ##s awesome but would you ?
ok , why would you do that ?
call her back then since you miss her like crazy
no way ! that ' s sad for the man but gross for you
wow that is disgusting
that ' s awesome ! where are you vacation ##ing to ?
i love the beach ! i ' m sure you ' ll have a great time there .
i hate spiders ! especially if you know there ##s one in the room where you are sleeping !
ha ##ha sorry , i ' ve been in that position and chose to sleep on the couch because of it !
that ' s really great that you have such a great partner like her !
i would be the same without my wife too !
aw , dan ##g , sounds like he is battling it very well though !
ou ##ch , i ' m very sorry for your loss ! you did your best , and i ' m sure he is in heaven now looking over you !
i can definitely understand how you would be worried about that . i think i ' d have to decline - lo ##l ! you are a good person for being willing to meet with him .
well , yes if there is a child involved , then you ' ve got to deal with him at some point . i hope it goes well for you though .
i ' ve never watched a single full star wars movie , just bits and pieces ha ##ha
thanks , i will look into it ! maybe get caught up before the new movie comes out !
you must have been surprised ! were you happy about it ?
sounds great ! what a good idea your mom had !
no way ! that must have smelled so bad
i can imagine e ##w ##w
aw ##w man sorry for your loss , those are the worst , its like losing your best friend . i hope he passed away peacefully and happy .
aw ##w shoot , i lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well . i miss that big guy , he was like a brother to me . hope you ' re doing good now , he ' s in a good place .
it ' s okay ! a cheat weekend every now and then can be well deserved when on a diet ! start right now eating healthy again ! you can do it !
that ' s awesome ! good luck with your diet !
cong ##rat ##ulation ! it is really smart to be as prepared as possible ! this baby will change your world !
that is good . it will make you quite happy . i couldn ' t imagine life without my kid now !
ou ##ch ! that ' s the worst , are they pretty damaged ?
oh well , shake it off and keep fl ##au ##nting that nice car ! : )
good for you ! it ' s always so satisfying to look back and see how much you ' ve achieved .
nothing wrong with sleep - along with food it ' s what keeps us going ! how many hours do you work ?
yu ##m , what is she cooking ?
yu ##m that sounds delicious ! i ' m a vegetarian as well , i will have to look into the recipe for that !
oh wow . no i ' ve never had to deal with that before . i hope your husband is ok !
that ' s awesome that you had such a great support network to help you .
umm . . did you mean to kick it ?
they are kinda like rats with wings .
aw , poor fellow , well i ' m sure he was close to his home .
there ' s always next time , forgive yourself and help the next pup ##per you see !
oh you must be so sad , i know i would be if that had happened to me .
that is great ! i have a dog that i adopted in similar circumstances .
oh god no , my heart would be racing . were you scared ?
damn , i can ' t imagine ever going through that . i hope it was something minor and didn ' t affect you too much .
wow that intense , we all make mistakes though hope your ##e doing better !
sounds great ! yes relaxing time is always needed and appreciated .
hope you enjoy your week off ! sounds like you earned it : )
i take the bus so i don ' t have to deal with the traffic , but man that sounds like it would really stink
wow he sounds like jerk !
i used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother , she ' d tell me all about when my dad was little . i love old stories like that .
what an interesting field - my husband would love to say that was his profession !
oh oh , so now you don ' t know where your enemy is hiding . sounds scary .
how annoying , but would be wise imagine it jumping on you while you sleep .
what kind of chair is it ? a lou ##nging chair , or maybe a computer desk chair ?
o ##oo ##h , that ' ll be really good . it aug ##ht to be really comfortable too .
sweet ! , must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer .
oh yeah , gets too cold . i ' ve always wanted one of those concrete pools . i ' m stuck with an above ground one for now until i get enough money for one .
so what would you do to halt that ?
that ##s thoughtful ! \
that ' s not good , do you think he will pay you ?
you can take out a loan , but good luck , i hope you get it !
and no one told you about it ? maybe no one noticed it at all ?
that is horrible ! i hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice .
oh my ! i hope is ok !
yeah that is a really suck ##ying thing to do to you .
so how does he afford such luxury ?
ok , he shouldn ' t have stopped ! other kids deserves it too
how so ?
hard work usually pays off . which exams are you taking ?
i hope she recover ##s soon . i know it is hard to see loved ones sick .
that is good to hear . i am sure she will be fine .
good for you ! you are a lucky person !
that ' s great ! i ' m a bit jealous .
yeah i ' ve been through that feeling before , i had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company . what show was yours ?
oh i ' ve heard of that show , never got around to seeing it though . that sucks !
that ' s really great . i ' m happy for you .
congratulations , it sounds like you ' ve really made it . i envy you .
i ' m sorry to hear that you couldn ' t finish it ! what couldn ' t you finish ?
hey you are being too hard on yourself . i ' m sure your boss would prefer it done well and not rushed .
yes ! i always cried when i watched it as a child .
yes ! my kids cried too
oh i love the thrill of a good roller coaster .
it ' s definitely not for everyone . you either love them or you don ' t .
i could imagine . dogs are amazing .
definitely . hold on to those .
that ##s great , family comes first over everything !
yep , they ' re always there for you no matter what
awe ! really i was planning on seeing it this weekend .
really ? what was the main disappointment ?
that ##s nice , hope you will host them well ?
uh ##mm ##nn ! never knew you had room mates
oh my ! were you scared ? what did you do ?
well , i ' m glad you ' re in one piece now !
where are you going ?
what type of trip are you planning ?
oh don ' t stress it , i ' ve done that so many times . it happens
yeah , or buy pants without zipper ##s . but don ' t stress it , i ' m sure whoever saw it didn ' t really mind !
oh that sounds exciting . i ' ve always wanted to go .
i ' ve flown but not much and never left the country either . i hope y ' all have fun : )
there ' s some decent benefits to doing things the old way .
got anything specific you like to be traditional about ?
yes , i ' m a pick ##y eater .
yes , i hate that . i usually end up going back and getting some more just for me .
that ##s awesome , i can ##t imagine not having ac in this hot florida weather !
yeah the heat isn ' t as bad but mix it with humidity and you ' ve got the worst possible combination . its terrible !
that sounds like such a surprise . does he have a disability that keeps him at home ?
that ' s great to hear ! my papa is getting older too . it ' s nice to be able to spend time with him .
oh awesome , what part of florida ?
oh that sounds really fun and i bet she will love it all . i ' m jealous : )
wow , try next time !
well , that ##s how fate would have it
i ' m sorry to hear that . what happened ?
i know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service . they should train people to do a better job .
that is so sad . i know how it feels to lose a pet .
i lost a gold ##fish once . she was my best friend .
bet you ' ll be glad to have some free time on your hands at last .
lo ##l - yeah i can relate . kids can be a real handful when they don ' t have structure - as in during the summer months .
why do you say that ?
okay now i understand . . . completely ! i deal with that daily ! i am ready to give up on ever cleaning again .
that sounds rather convenient . are you giving up anything for that ?
if it ' s too traumatic for him , you can always try to put him back .
oh my goodness ! what did you do ? i bet your heart was racing !
ha ##ha ##ha that sounds about how i would have reacted ! i once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room . i sat there frozen thinking someone was outside . then , i moved and the shadow did too !
that ##s awesome , i don ##t have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends . such innocent times .
yes it does , i wish her the best ! early adulthood is the best time !
i agree and it ' s full of commercials no one wants to see .
oh yes , i know what you are saying . i ' ve never been into got but i ' ve heard it ' s good .
i would be so mad . i can ' t believe people can do that and sleep at night
i hope so too . that is just not right . they could have left a note at least .
wow ! love birds , how nice , so where exactly are you headed ?
well , it would be a whole new experience for you
how annoying ! did she fix it fast ?
that would be frustrating . did it get corrected ? did you still have to pay ?
im sorry that ##s awful , i hope he makes a full recovery
i can only imagine !
that ' s cool , what is the position ?
don ' t wish , demonstrate . do something that reflects what type of supervisor you ' re going to be . people love preview ##s .
give me an example ?
i get it . it does seem like they are always coming out with another version .
oh , that ' s too bad . perhaps have the picnic indoors ? it wouldn ' t be the same , but at least you could share food and have a laugh !
i can imagine . that ' s the problem with planning outside events - we can ' t di ##cta ##te the weather . you should try planning something outdoors in scotland , where i ' m from - so ##ggy food every time ! !
who has cancer ? someone you know ?
well i am no cancer expert . probably should get a second opinion from a doctor .
lo ##l . . . . no sweetie , i ' m sure it ' s your dog again . didn ' t the same thing happen last month ?
oh sorry about that i thought you had a dog . well then maybe the noise the some type of cr ##itte ##r . have you checked under the bed today ?
i remember that . a lot of people were grossed out and didn ' t want to do it . were your girls one of them ?
ye ##a , it tends to be kinda gross . my teacher had us di ##sse ##ct fish as well and i prefer ##e that much more for some reason
i sure hope they are trust ##worthy .
it is so good to have someone that is trust ##worthy no matter what you tell them . i ' m glad you have a friend like that .
i ' m so sorry to hear that , my girlfriend ' s cat is going through the same thing right now . it can ' t be easy .
that ' s so sad . . . the best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count . i wish you all the best .
usually people want someone in their life . i guess that takes staying away from others .
some people prefer to be alone . whatever makes them happy i suppose .
i would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that
i hope you can share it on social media so that the whole world can share in the fun : )
i do too , its a shame
i am too , i hope we can make a change before it is too late
lucky for you ! i ' m at work right now ! ha ##ha !
no , its fine ! enjoy your day off , i definitely would if i were you !
oh , that ' s awful . were you okay , or did you have to go to the hospital ?
that sounds terrifying ! i ' ve never been in a car accident , and sure wouldn ' t like to be in one .
oh wow did it bring back memories ?
that is so fun ! memories are always a wonderful thing to have
well it is good to be thankful . we have to remember all the little things .
it is good to appreciate what we have , not op ##ine for what we don ' t have .
i hope you got it on camera , i would if i was in your shoe ##as
nice , buddy he will thank you for it when he grows up
aw ##w ##w good for him !
i ' m glad he ' s getting better with his speech and i hope he continues to improve !
i hate when that happens . i ' m so bad with directions .
what did you end up doing ?
i depend so heavily on my gps , i don ' t know what i would have done
oh that ' s great news . i bet he is having lots of fun .
that ' s great . some people can go through college and still don ' t know what they want to do .
that ' s a ton of oyster ##s ! i don ' t think i ' ve even ever eaten one oyster . what ' s a mixed plate ?
hmm it ' s funny how season ##ings and spices really alter the via ##bility of a food . was the buffet all seafood ?
that is awesome to hear , i bet the pays good too
if your happy there i would stay if not seek the better pay in a different town
oh man that had to be embarrassing . i know how you feel though b / c i once went to work with two different shoes on
well it will probably never happen again so don ' t worry about it to much
i ' m so sorry . i know that must be very difficult for you . it ' s nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together .
pictures are a great way to remember the past . i treasure every picture . each holds a special memory .
we all do it . i bet they deserved it .
they sound like my kids . i hope they start be ##ha ##ving better for you .
dogs can be so destructive .
poor thing had no clue why you were mad
ok , so are you gonna go ?
that ##s nice
dan ##g three times ? i hope you get that figured out !
yeah get that right . make sure you don ' t fail it four times !
how shocking ! i have got to know , are you keeping the pup ##pies or giving them up for adoption ?
good idea . i hope they aren ' t too much of a handful until then !
oh that sounds horrible . i hope it wasn ' t a long ride on the bus .
oh no , that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically .
i bet so . its a shame when people don ##t take care of their teeth
i wouldn ##t doubt it !
i have found that using al ##ot of online recipes with good instructions helps . cannabis also induce ##s hunger and reduced ad ##hd thus it helps me pay better attention , even more so when i ' m hungry af !
yes i always pay attention to the reviews and peoples personal comments , they can often be price ##less !
not that i can think of . can you give me an example ?
oh , i see what you mean . that ' s frustrating !
did you at least study for it ?
that is the best feeling !
oh wow , that really sucks . did you ever find the cu ##lp ##rit ?
yeah , i would ' ve definitely quit once i saw that .
i hate when they do that ! were you able to clean the rug ?
i bet ! time to get him trained a little better .
wow that is huge . he must have a lot of stuff to haul .
as long as he remembers to make wide turns . otherwise bad things happen ha ##ha .
has it ever been a ghost ?
yeah fears like that are pretty un ##con ##sol ##able .
that ' s so awesome ! what did he say ?
oh my . what a strange first word .
i ' m not quite sure i understand , did you go bowling by yourself ? if so that ' s so sad and lone ##some .
as someone who deals with lone ##some moments , i know how that feels . i would ' ve totally gone with you had i known you ha ##ha .
did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it
next time you go in , put the money of the candy into one of those charity cans
yeah me too ! are you going to go with anyone ?
nice ! i am sure it is going to be a ball of a time .
that is a real bum ##mer . maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life .
yeah , no need to talk to me about it right now . think about all the good times you had together .
that really stink ##s . have you gone to get some help on it ?
i am sure he will be able to help you . i hope you pass .
oh no . that sounds like a messy situation .
hopefully he ' ll learn that that ' s not the place to do that .
i am sure once you clean up your sc ##ruff ##y look you ' ll be able to land all the ladies .
nah , you can for ##go de ##od ##oran ##t . the media just tells everyone it ' s necessary since it ' s a poorly known method of government mind control .
he must be related to my dog . was it hard to clean up ?
you may want to check his diet . something in not right there .
that is so awesome ! good for her !
amazing ! i would be proud if i were you as well !
really , i can ' t believe you like it . are you sure he bought it and not his mom lo ##l ?
either way you have the perfect outfit to go on a date with your boyfriend right ?
oh no ! is your dog trained to go outside ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . just take some deep breaths , wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better . you can do this and you ' ll be alright !
yeah , i am the same way . incredibly unsafe to do such a thing .
i know . i don ' t want to die doing something incredibly mundane .
i hope you feel bad about what you did
as long as you can live with yourself , is all that matters lo ##l
that sounds very relaxing . what kind of book was it ?
oh i get that magazine too . i like it for the stories .
dan ##g . what did you by ? mountain dew and do ##rito ##s ?
a much better purchase than the neck ##be ##ard ' s staple . i hope you won !
that sucks , was it a nice rug ?
that ' s awful , put the dogs nose in it .
nice ! which one you getting ?
dan ##g ! now that is a sa ##v ##vy phone ! i have 12 of them .
aw how wonderful . she must have been really proud of herself and happy .
truth be told : i never learned how to ride a bike .
that sounds like an interesting life choice . it ' s probably very calming .
it ' s an important tool set to have !
have you been studying ? if you do that , i am sure you won ' t fail .
nice ! i am sure you will pass with flying colors .
you are the 2nd one today . was it a mile high ?
that must have been quite the workout . at least you should have plenty of fuel for the winter .
oh that ##s a nice surprise
that ##s really cool
shocking . does that not happen often for you ?
ah well better than me . i get it so much it doesn ' t even bother me anymore .
lo ##l owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point !
i hope nobody in your office is the easily offended type !
nice ! did you steal anything while you were there ?
well , at least you filled your stomach . next time , don ' t forget about your pockets !
congratulations , that ##s amazing . what did he say ?
wow , he ##s a pretty smart kid . he must be reading up on his history and the communist manifesto .
that ' s too bad . did someone cut you off ?
aw ##w ##w i would be sad too . did anyone go and get it ?
understand ##ably so . you must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal .
that ' s a great idea . no need to let go of the place you call home completely . i hope everything works in your best interests !
that ##s fair tho i wouldn ##t worry about it
good luck with that
that is a very nice friend . moving is hard work .
hope you don ' t have to move again any time soon .
i hate when that happens . i bet that smelled great .
my dog did that the other day . i yelled at her and told her that we don ' t po ##op in the house
nice ! did you fall ?
oh no ! well , at least it sounded like you and everyone had a good time .
e ##w ##w i know how that feels
i would be too
oh gee ##z ! i bet that was a catastrophe !
i bet . i would ' ve been sick .
lo ##l sorry for laughing , but that sounds like something i would agree to and forget , im afraid of heights too
sometimes when my friends are annoying me , i tune out . . . later o yeah we are supposed to do this today and blah , blah , blah
oh , that ' s a good point ! i never realized how much money i was spending for fast food until i started making a budget .
my go to lazy - sandwich are fried bal ##og ##na sandwiches . it ' s saved me a lot of money , that ' s for sure .
that sucks . are you hurt ?
i would be mad too . are you going to sue ?
that ##s so amazing
that ##s so cool
that is unfortunate . i hope it wasn ' t 1 or 2 miles high ?
that amount of po ##op really does things to a rug . i recommend getting a new house .
that sucks . did you ever find any worms in the apples ?
yeah , if only i could go back and have a crisp apple with some snake oil . . . all would be right with the world .
must ##ve been some good convincing . was it a robbery ?
ye ##a , my phone is pretty expensive . im not giving my phone to anybody
im not sure i think its just an old tradition
ye ##a i hate clown ##s too
where did you lose it at ?
yeah , that is a good thing he found it and not someone else . what are the odds .
they are so lucky . i would love to have a new car .
i would be jealous , because i drive an old cl ##unk ##er
oh no ! that ' s horrible . were you able to clean it up ?
i could imagine .
that ##s great , good job .
ye ##a i tend to have similar issues
happy birthday ! are you excited ?
i hope you have a great time
oh boy , did you em ##bar ##ras ##s yourself by getting real scared ?
that ' s something that ' s easy to laugh about after the fact but i bet you were running for your life when it happened ! ha ##ha
i know what you mean . its an easy cho ##re , but sometimes that smell is gross . its that sweet smell . yu ##ck
well now i definitely don ' t want to take the garbage out tonight . ill make someone else do it
oh really ? why was that ?
understand ##able , no one should have to go hungry
that ' s horrible ! what happened ?
that really sucks . i am glad you are okay .
that really sucks . maybe you should get another job ?
i am truly sorry for your lots . i am sure things will get better .
well that ' s great ! i ' m guessing he has a bad habit of doing that ?
i guess you ' ve been training him and it ' s paying off ? tell him he ' s a good boy and give him a belly rub !
oh that ' s so ag ##gra ##vating , my dog still has accidents but not many
that ' s terrible but the rug is replace ##able .
im sorry to hear that , my child hood friend died in a car crash , and it hurt me for a really long time , i still have dreams about him through out the years
his family must be going through some tough times right now , i hope everything goes well
i ' ve actually heard a little bit about cb ##d oil from my sister , but i never did any research myself or try it out .
oh wow , so it actually works ? i might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it , she has a lot of pain in her legs as well .
i absolutely will ! thanks for the suggestion .
that sounds like so much fun . what concert is it ?
don ' t stop bel ##ie ##vin . i bet you ' ll have a great time !
i wouldn ' t look forward to that either . what are you going in for ?
that doesn ' t sound grand at all . hopefully it is a pain ##less procedure .
that ' s super nice of her !
good parents are super useful !
that sounds like a job !
i wish you good luck with that !
why did you steal candy from the store ?
did you not have any money to pay for it ?
oh no ! is that the first time it has happened ?
may i recommend gloves ? thick gloves . and a lot of carpet cleaner .
wow , that really stink ##s . did you catch the cu ##lp ##rit ?
yeah , especially since i imagine that is a costly monthly expense . i would install some turrets in your garage .
that ' s always fun to clean up .
think of it this way . yesterday i had to clean up my dog ' s vomit , where it vomit ##ed up a used tam ##pon .
nice ! which game is it ?
sounds really fun ! i think i will pick it up today .
that ' s cool . what city ?
oh sweet . i hope he has a good time in college .
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that . how long did you have your rabbit for ?
i could imagine . i don ' t have any pets . but i understand it can be really devastating .
oh no ! we ' re you able to clean it up ?
yeah hopefully it doesn ' t happen again !
e ##w ! sounds like a disgusting job .
that ' s great ! good to hear you ' re saving some money !
i do too , but seems like most people are like that nowadays
i would be mad , we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived .
o ##ops . could you sneak it back in without him seeing you ?
depends how close you are and how mad he ' ll be . usually , i advocate honesty , but don ' t know enough about your situation to advise .
oh boy . i honestly don ' t know what to say . maybe ask him outright if he ' s cheating . if he is , do you really want to stay with him ? if not , it doesn ' t matter if he knows about the phone or not !
good luck ! but be nice - i ' ve confronted people before and totally lost it . i then regretted it .
that sucks , hope it didn ' t dry into the carpet .
that ' s pretty understand ##able .
that ##s great , good job
i know that feel
nice ! where is he going to school at ?
wow , that ' s pretty far away . how do you feel about him going all the way up there ?
dan ##git , i would have been pretty upset , not to mention the clean up
sh ##hh ##hh ##hee ##ee ##ess , that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage
that ' s so sad ! maybe you should give him a call ?
that ' s the spirit ! the loneliness should melt away !
oh no ! ! you must have been so mad !
that dog probably wouldn ' t be living in my house anymore ! ! did you have it cleaned ?
that is not good . did you sc ##old your cat ?
i can imagine . my dog used to stain the carpet too .
that really sucks . what kind of car was it ?
ah , i used to have one of those . those cars were built to last .
i think the opposite , honestly .
yeah i know , thanks .
what happened ? ? you did not studied hard enough ?
the best thing for you is learn from this and do better next time
that was nice of your neighbor ! i hope everything was still inside of it !
that ' s such a relief ! it ' s such a has ##sle to cancel all of your credit cards and get a new id ! you should give him a reward !
nice ! what grade is your son in ?
nice ! i am sure he is going to be hanging with the popular folk in no time .
ha ! at least you ' re confident in your skills . do you do anything special to it ?
that is all good to know ! i ' ll have to keep it in mind next time i cook it .
that is terrible , i am so sorry . was it of natural causes ?
you can just replace him that fast ? don ' t you need time ?
that ##s pretty brave of you facing a fear like that . how did you feel when the flight was over ?
flights are convenient though . define ##tly faster than driving somewhere
how exciting ! where to ?
i am happy for you and hope you have a lot of fun !
cong ##rat ##ulation ! that ##s awesome . i know how much work that can be
you ' ll get there one day . it takes time and saving
lo ##l are they still hold ##ig that against you ?
lo ##l . we all cheated at some point . they know that .
did you try to find someone to go with ?
maybe you should find some new friends .
mine did too - 5 minutes ago , actually . are you thinking about getting a new one ?
that ' s too bad . perhaps it would help you heal your troubles away .
hell yeah ! return of the king !
yu ##p , he ' s been through a lot
that must of looked really bad .
why not buy another gift ?
that ' s awesome ! sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright ! shows per ##se ##verance and a " never give up " attitude .
oh yeah . makes for a great game when it ' s close !
i am so happy for you ! i have been married for ten years and it is the most reward ##ing thing ever . but you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything .
thank you . well lets talk about the wedding , hopefully you have a wedding planner to help you right . i don ' t want you to stress out to much , you are the excited bride !
well good , let her do all the worrying and you focus on your big day !
oh wow , that ' s kind of rude .
have you brought it up to her ? maybe she doesn ' t realize she ' s doing it .
where did it go ?
i hope so , hope is still alive , and have you search everywhere ?
oh no ! how did you find out ?
ah , i see . i hope you find someone more respectful and caring
oh that is awesome ! even barely awesome employers are hard to find .
yeah they generally have a better chance at giving it more so than large entities .
oh yeah , especially when it is something you are really looking forward to receiving .
yep , but at least we have the internet to take care of those things .
did you try red ##oin ##g your steps of the last day ? to see maybe you left it at a friends house
i feel bad for you , have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it ?
what do you love about football season ? ( they ' re football right ? )
wonderful ! good luck , i hope they win .
what are they repeating ?
i hope you can provide them with some help .
it ' s awesome . sometimes i also try to find solutions in youtube .
yeah , you ' re right .
that ' s terrible . did you guys clear that out ?
people must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that .
oh my . how did you handle the situation with your todd ##ler ?
they can be pretty crazy at that age .
i bet your so excited ! i just got one last month too and it makes my life so much easier !
ao ##l slow lo ##l . . i certainly know how you feel ! i would have ex ##ped ##ited it to me !
where did he go
oh sorry to hear that
i ' m assuming they didn ' t leave insurance info ?
that sucks , man . are you gonna get it fixed ?
yi ##kes , high risk investment ?
is it something that can recover over time ? i hope so
a lot of marriages also end in divorce , when they go into it too soon .
you ' ll find someone . you sound like a good person .
why did your friendship with your friend ended ?
that is true i agree with you , that is not what friends do
for what purpose you do this
how his your health now
you sound lonely . do you not have any friends ?
have you considered joining any hobby groups to make some new friends ?
oh that ##s sweet . cong ##rat ##s
im sure it won ##t take you long with that degree
that ' s terrible ! were you in a bad part of town or anything ?
that kind of thing always creep ##s me out . glad you made it ok !
why is that , is there something scheduled today that you really are trying to avoid ?
my first marriage was much like that , i hope you have a very calm day and no arguing .
great job ! did anything else come with it ?
yeah , anything is better than nothing . good work !
did you take it in to get fixed ?
ah i understand now
i hear you ! what made you feel all alone ?
oh okay ! where did they go ?
what time was that ?
wow long time ! are you still at this job ?
complaint them about the product
om ##g . that ' s unfair
you must be proud . what kind of cake did you make .
i love tres le ##che . i haven ' t had a slice of that in forever .
oh god . are you ok ?
we ' ve all been em ##bara ##ssed at work lo ##l . don ' t even worry about it .
did you propose her ?
oh , so sad . you may try one more time .
oh no . what happened ? !
what was the size ?
oh cool ! does he have a country club membership ? what were you doing that you couldn ' t go ?
oh i am sorry ! bum ##mer to miss out
oh i bet that was so good
that is always a good feeling
amazing ! cong ##rat ##s !
how long does film school last ?
so you have two dogs ? that is so nice i love dogs .
beautiful , sounds like she is in good hands .
they must have something against trucks
that ' s true and also not a good sign if a cop decides to pull you over
is your current ceiling fan broken ?
nice , i hope you enjoy it . gr ##ats on the house too .
oh ! i do too ! they are so healthy and you can get them without any sugar too !
oh . . . well you should try it without , fruit itself is already full of sugar : ) if you try the ones with orange juice , they can be pretty sweet on their own .
i ' m sorry to hear that , sounds like family took a trip ?
i ' m glad the bad times have stopped and hope your fur ##ki ##ds can help cheer you up . i feel lonely at times too it ' s only human .
oh yes they are ! i love it when that happens
lo ##l ! cool , what kind of memory did it trigger ?
oh you are brave ! i love the ocean but i am terrified of being in the middle of it : )
how fast are they supposed to be going ?
there ' s a lot of selfish people in the world , and a lot of impatient ones too . it ' s extremely frustrating .
did you mute it
i hate when that happens
we don ' t see many here . do you live in a city ?
well , the city probably should do something about it .
what happened to make him flood things ? something over ##flow ##ed ?
that ' s too bad . well i hope it didn ' t ruin anything special ? ?
what happened ? is she undergoing it for depression or what ?
so disgusting to see such ir ##res ##pon ##sible parents bringing up a child in such conditions . hope for him to be well
that sucks . someone in a parking lot do that to you ?
and i bet they just drove off and didn ' t even leave a note .
that ##s cool !
it sure does feel good that someone notices
that has to be really annoying . have you called animal control ?
yes , that ' s one way to deal with it . what did you end up doing ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . was there something going on around you that made you scared ?
wooded ares are beautiful , until you have to be alone in them , when it ' s dark .
what was impressive about that ?
everyone knew he was going to do it though
that sounds cool
i bet it was
that sounds like so much fun . i ' ve actually never been to a casino but would love to .
i would feel the same way . i ' m not always very lucky though so i ' d be a little app ##re ##hen ##sive at first .
i ' m sure she ' ll be happy with whatever gift you got her .
what was it that she wanted ?
wow . how much did they win ?
je ##ez , that ' s a lot ! i hope they can manage it ok .
you try calling for a status update ?
ah it happens i guess
pets are great companions ! what kind of pet is it ?
wow i was not expecting that ! i ' m happy that you get to spend time with it .
why ? what ' s going on ? or , y ' know , not going on ?
is there something going on that ' s got you feeling that way ?
slippery floor , or slippery you ?
oh , been there before . sometimes i ' m given things that make me very un ##stead ##y .
what did she do ? woke up late ?
ah ye ##a mine does that . . i have a spray bottle for days like that : )
oh no . that is go ##rri ##ble
did the person stop ?
why on earth would someone do that ? a totally pointless act !
some people will steal anything , i guess . a store employee once told me they had to keep certain things by the check ##out or they walked !
it sure is ! i got caught ( when i was about 8 ) bouncing a ping po ##ng ball while leaving a toy store . the owner took me home and my dad gave me a hiding . never again !
oh yes . while other teenagers were th ##ieving i was being a very good little girl ! hope you get a replacement for your trash can .
how ' d they do ?
good for them
on your car ? ? did you get it on camera ?
oh bum ##mer ! i can ' t stand it when people are that selfish ! i wish we had cc ##tv cameras everywhere like they do in the uk
i bet it was !
i wouldn ##t even try that

how long have you been working there for ?
kinda creepy then that you are randomly the only one there
that ' s awesome . do you workout regularly ?

hard work pays of
keep up the good work !
gross ! do you work in a restaurant ?
that ' s sucks . i bet all that food smells .

do you give them money ?
ye ##a me too
oh damn ! ! did you find who it was ?
ah that sucks ! ! bad luck ! !
oh no ! did you actually see them do it ?
that is really frustrating . were you able to claim it on your insurance ? i can ' t imagine how frustrating that must have felt .
i bet that was fun . like where ? a museum or something lo ##l
oh wow that is surprising . did you guys have a picnic ?
that ' s a mess and i feel pity for you
use thinner which is used for painting , i think that ought to do
stay positive , you never know . maybe send them a polite email saying thank you for the interview and things you liked about the company .

that ##s always good when they can ##t wait to return
that ' s always disappointing . in time for what ?
oh that ' s too bad . i am sure you felt bad , but your son probably understood .
sounds like life is finally moving the right direction for you , it ' s great to be thankful for the simple things in life !
yes : ) people get so caught up in material things and forgot how blessed they are to have food and shelter !
why ' s that ? what happened ?
that can be scary ! there ' s usually nobody in the woods though luckily .
did you call the po - po ?
ye ##a they are dumb .

hard work pays off i guess
great , where will you be going ?
don ' t take too much money with you .
did you find out who did it ?

i love package delivery days ! i ' ve got a couple coming as well . what are you waiting for ?
oh wow , a big package ! hope you enjoy it !
ou ##ch . . . i ' d have to admit that it would make me a tad nervous .
absolutely ! that is definitely the attitude to have . trust is huge in making a relationship successful . it ' s just natural to feel a bit nervous .
ha ##ha ##ha you must be so proud ! how long did it take you to teach him ?
man , i ' d love to see that !
dan ##g , heartbreak ##ing . if i were your co - worker and you told me that , i ' d lend you at least a couple bucks for the ve ##nding machines or something . hopefully you can go home and have a nice dinner .
ah , there you go . the world isn ' t completely heart ##less . yeah , i think the trick is to always keep that stuff with your car keys , because then you ' ll never forget it .
ou ##ch that sucks . honestly , if you had a crap ##py obama ##care bronze plan its unlikely they ' d pay for anything anyway ##s . its always a nightmare . you ' ve got to spend a fair am ##ont of cash before they cover anything but a check ##up .
yep , you ' ll probably be fine . give it a couple of days .
that ##s a bad feeling : / don ##t be too hard on yourself
yeah but its a test ! its not like you cheated on your spouse or did something severe ! lo ##l
that is always a good feeling .
that ##s the spirit . it is always exciting to start something new .
that must be so nice having that freedom .
do you feel you could see yourself marrying her ?
what is her name ?
lucky you , my girlfriend elaine is a bit mean sometimes .
i love dogs ! i bet you were so happy .
oh my god , i ' ve always wanted a husky ! you are so lucky . they do have beautiful eyes .
o ##oo ##h , that ' s exciting ! what schools did you apply for ?
that ' s worth being nervous over . i ' m sure you ' ll do great !
oh yeah what do you plan on doing ?
sounds like a good time !
did you have some back up clothes ?
oh that stink ##s
i ' m sorry , that made me laugh . never really seen a parrot speak that well before . thought it as just something you see in movies . does it say anything else fun ?
that ' s . . . a really interesting strategy . wonder what will happen once he actually does lose weight and doesn ' t want to be called fat anymore ! well , i guess to each their own .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . it ' s hard losing someone that dear to her . i hope she opens herself up to healing .
it ' s gonna take some time , and i ' m sure those phone calls help more than you think .
i did that 32 years ago in high school .
right , i understand that . it ' s not a nice thing .
what is your wife ##s name ?
do you love her lots ?
that ##s a bum ##mer ! how long ago did you lose it ?
well i hope you find it , and a winning lot ##to ticket at the same time .
good to hear ! cong ##rat ##s ! !
hope you ' ll receive more bonus in upcoming days ! !
what did you all make
that sounds ta ##sty .
what happened ?
did you ever find him ?
did he do it in a normal fashion or did he stared at you weird
you should have told someone that is how robbers usually target people
that ' s great ! are you trying to buy a house ?
it ' s nice to have a place of your own . i remember the excitement i felt when i bought my house .
that ##s good
that ##s good that it wasn ##t major .
that ' s a good way to go into an interview . did it go well ?
awesome , cong ##rat ##s on your new job .
i bet you can ' t wait . is it a substantial raise ?
that ' s fantastic . congratulations ! buy yourself a little treat .
i ' m glad you ' ve found a change of pace .
of course it is . i ' d say it ' ll benefit each other .
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that you don ' t have enough money for food , but stealing isn ' t the answer ! maybe there ' s a local food bank you can contact .
call your local support services . usually it ' s 211 . they can put you in contact with charities , churches and other organizations who can help you ! i wish you the best !
did you ask him to wash the dishes ?
you should do to him a strong amount of punishment !
oh no , is your dog okay ?
i hope your dog is found safe !
sounds like fun
i hope it goes well !
that is fantastic . anything new going on ?
i wish i was that content with my life . i have too many changes going on right now .
i bet it did . i would love to listen to my old cds
what a fun way to re ##mini ##sc ##e .
yeah , you ' re right . are you in reunion now ?
it ' s very hard to leave . but the memories will always cheer with us .
did you prepare for it ?
it ' s not too late . you will have to pull an all night ##er and study . if you are prepared you will feel better about going .
are you going to get another ?
probably best to also take time to process what happened
amazing ! how old is he ?
good on him ! for what it ' s worth i ' m super proud of him !
that must be annoying , what kind of dog ?
maybe try asking the neighbor about him ?
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . what kind of test was it ?
calculus seems like very hard stuff for anyone . don ' t feel too down . just use this as motivation to study more !
that ' s the spirit ! never quit and give up . everyone fails sometimes .
do you have a rather large family ?
will you have music and dance ?
are you excited about it ?
maybe you should confront them about it .
heck yeah . tackle the issue head on ! maybe it ' ll workout and they ' ll try to be nice ##r .
aw , thanks . i hope it all works out for you . have a great day !
oh no what happened ? why don ' t you think you did well ?
i hope its better than you expect !
o ##oh that is rough having to prepare for . how do you think you did ?
that ' s awesome ! i ' m so glad to hear that ! hopefully this boost ##s your confidence for next time , now you know you can do it .
oh its really frustrating and not fair
ok don ' t feel bad be happy and search for your future behalf
war ##craft - that ' s an online role play game , right ?
i ' m afraid i avoid those games - too addict ##ive . i ' d never get anything else done ! presumably you play .
hmm . perhaps i should have a look then . i just have such an addict ##ive personality - hopeless !
oh , there are plenty of those , believe me , lo ##l . at least you enjoy it tho ' . that ' s good .
not really
i know , is it like when i got my new car ?
a ford mustang i always like muscle cars !
pontiac makes good cars . but more importantly your wardrobe mis ##ha ##p is a little funny , sorry . hope everything worked out .
that ' s awesome ! did you get a good deal ?
some people enjoy fixing things . that will be fun if you ' re ready for it . what kind of car did you get ?
not me . i ' d be walking if i did .
youtube makes things so much easier to learn .
oh no ! what happened ?
oh je ##ez ##e . did they catch them on film ? hopefully insurance will take care of it .
won the lottery ?
well that ##s good too !
i love animals ! what kind of pet does she have ?
oh wow , that ' s unusual .
uh oh ! have you checked your sugar lately ?
after that bag of candy , you may want to !
i ' m jealous of you . i ' m a little intro ##verted and anti ##so ##cial , and never got good at developing friendships where i could make them long - lasting and trust ##worthy . good for you
yeah , since i ' ve been in college , i ' ve been forced to social ##ize more and i ' m getting better at it . it ' s a muscle just like anything else i guess , and you have to " work it out . "
that ' s great ! anything helps as you said , keep trying for more !
we certainly need to do better as a country to make higher education more affordable .
oh , what kind of relationship is it ?
yi ##kes , stop the relationship at all cost !
are you happy for her ?
well if you treat her right she won ' t go any where .
oh ye ##a ? is it for higher pay or just needing a different scenery ?
is the new city have a higher cost of living ?
i feel you man . i ' m off in 1 hour and 11 minutes . tick to ##ck .
its a small world . . . maybe we even work at the same place .
oh god , i think we ' ve all gone through that . did you have nice und ##ies on though ?
oh that ' s not too bad then !
it ' s pretty good ! hope you had a good time !
sure . visit again and suggest your friends too .
oh boy ! is it yours ?
i love pup ##pies . what kind of breed is it ?
have you tried driving around and looking for it ? or calling the neighbors for help ? maybe they have seen it .
i hope they are able to locate him ! check to see if your friend had it micro ##chi ##pped .
it is tough ! do you have family nearby ?
that would be hard .
cool . girl or boy ?
are yo going to spoil him ?
i know what you mean lo ##l
oh boy , what are you going to do ? do you have a good bus system you can use ?
i hear you ! i hate physical activity that seems unnecessary .
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha ##ha . i love that plan !
oh goodness ! that is terrible to hear ! have you contacted someone to help clean it up ? that can easily cause mold .
try seeing if your insurance with cover it . if not grab a shop va ##c or 2 ! they are great at sucking up water out of tight spaces
that ' s a bum ##mer . did you make her chicken no ##odle soup
that ' s good she ' s got a nur ##turing / caring mom , i know some pretty bad parents out there
they never learn , do they ?
oh well , we tried didn ' t we .
that ' s so nice of you to be supportive to your friend through struggles . is it a long time struggle or something sudden ?
that ' s awful . its so good they have someone like you who is there for them when they need you most .
oh well , you will get it clean
i guess try and get those done first
congratulations ! i bet you ' re happy .
i ' m super happy for you ! you ' ll do great .
that is great , what kind of dancer is she ?
i ' m impressed , where did she win the medal ?
that ' s awful . is she alright now ?
hope she will be fine soon !
that is pretty un ##sett ##ling . whereabouts do you live
i used to live close to north minneapolis and i would always hear people fighting in the streets and every once in a while a gunshot . got pretty des ##ens ##iti ##zed to it though
what is a clean fade
oh it sounds kind of cool
that ' s a shame . what is it that prevents you from getting them done ?
financial constraints are definitely a good reason . maybe one of your friends could help you out .
cool do they have tournaments ?
do you play too ?
me either lo ##l . i wo ##ld be a good water boy lo ##l
that ##s some really good progress right there
i guess that could make you regret even the things you never thought og
what was the basic ji ##st of what they were saying ?
that ' s something i personally struggle with . i never feel like i have enough money to hand out , but there ' s many people worse off than me who could use it .
that is amazing , what level is the team ?
that is even more impressive ! i know they take hockey seriously up there , so your friend must be pretty dar ##n good .
i hope he does . it would be good to have a friend in the nhl !
you must be some proud of that .
do you think she has a future in music ?
nice were they guy friends or girl friends
why did you feel cocky . . . did you talk to any hot ##ties at the bar or what
oh , how do they go for that ?
do they like you doing that ?
i do not believe that
i hate when that happens , did you try to get a ref ##und ?
well , hopefully they get it resolved . does not help your lunch today however .
i don ' t blame you ! i would ' ve been furious if some girl was talking to my husband that way . rid ##ulous how awful some people are .
ha ha , that ' s a good one .
i would hate that . luckily my dog makes enough noise for 5 ! my kids are grown and gone , too .
pit / wolf hybrid . she helps so much .
go ##sh that is horrible ! did you try to call the company ? next time cho ##oe a company that guarantees they will come or the service is free
oh yes , i understand , i had no choice either . there is only one provider in my area
i ' m dealing with the same thing right now ! i had to teach her how to par ##ral ##el park yesterday ! it is terrifying !
you can take her to the d ##m ##v when they are closed ! they will allow you to use there set up to help .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . how long has it been if i may ask ?
i am very sure he was proud of you , and cher ##ished every moment he could spend with you while he was alive .
that sounds like a fun event
i am sure you will get it soon as well
that ' s more rare than diamonds . you ' d better hold on to him
awesome . can i get his number ; )
there is no better feeling than getting off of work !
maybe you can knock off 43 minutes early .
that is the worst !
that ' s too bad . what age is he ?
oh no ! does he have the option of taking it again ?
oh no ! i would have a heart attack ! are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them ?
ha ##ha ##ha i would have been like a mad woman trying to clean too ! i hope it works out and your husband can take time off !
have you thought about cutting it down ?
sounds pretty creepy
impressive , what do you plan to do with the degree ?
cool , i hope you find success , and that your hard work pays off .
that ' s the worst , what did you eat then ?
oh no ! you should try to find the cu ##lp ##rit and confront them
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha ##ha . i ' m sorry for laughing , but that struck me as funny . is he trying his best , or is he trying to get the point across that he shouldn ' t be cooking ?
that might be a good christmas present . you could do it as a couple . i did one of those with my wife last year and it was a blast .
i hear those wild ##fires are getting really bad . i hope they don ' t affect you too badly .
drive safe ! i really hope they can get those wild ##fires under control soon .
oh , i ' m so excited for you ! i hope you get a raise too !
me too ! as long as it ' s not bad news right ?
that would be hard , can one work independently ?
i ' m sure you are doing an amazing job , you seem to care which makes you a great parent .
i am sorry to hear that , what did you dog do to make you angry ?
i hate to hear that , hopefully you were able to get your garden lined out .
oh my goodness , that must have been humiliating . what did you do ?
did it happen after you got out of the pool ?
i am so sorry that happened to you .
oh my go ##sh , that ' s the dream ha ##ha . what did you eat the most of ?
wow , that ' s dedication . i guess those plates add up . that ' s not a very nice policy for a restaurant to have .
awesome , what was it for ?
be grateful . most people don ' t have a team to make them look good by comparison .
don ' t look a gift horse in the mouth ; d
ha ##ha ##ha . kids are wonderful .
well that ' s wonderful that you had a supporting aunt like that . how do you think you did on your test ?
well , i ' m real glad for you ! you should make your aunt a pie or something sometime .
ha ##ha . . yeah it is kid of pointless but it is a little fun as a kid . im sure your son will remember
i agree . i remember a lot of obscure things that my parents are surprised i remember .
excellent ! which beach ?
i ' m jealous .
where are you guys going ?
that ' s awesome ! how long are you staying there ? i ' m sure you will enjoy your time . i went to mississippi a couple of months ago to see my family , it was so awesome
do you sleep better when it rains too ?
oh well at least you get to listen to it now
oh no ! have you tried the old " put it in a bag of rice " trick ?
give it a few days ( even though it feels like a million ) . i ' ll cross my fingers for you ! i ' m so sorry , that is a huge bum ##mer !
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i wish i could come over and help you clean up
that ' s good . what are you having for dinner ?
o ##of , are you sure you don ' t want to try a half marathon first ? you ' ll need to train quite a bit before doing a full marathon
oh ! well then stay hydra ##ted ! i hope you do well !
don ' t worry . soon you ' ll get good friends .
yeah , you should explore it !
glad to hear that . im guessing you have studied hard ?
congratulations ! ! im glad to hear that . was the exam hard ?
oh no that is terrible . is there anyone near you that could be of help ? maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear ? i ' m so sorry to hear this .
i know it means swallowing some pride , but if it ' s financial help you need , perhaps you could go the route of go ##fu ##nd ##me ? or maybe government services ? i know it might be embarrassing to some people , but sometimes your back is against the wall you have nothing to lose .
i ' m happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey . you do seem like you would enjoy that .
hey , some people are on this planet to fry birds , and some people aren ' t . i guess that ' s just how it is .
i understand how you feel . my sister struggled to get pregnant . she did in ##vi ##tro twice .
the first one didn ' t work . apparently the second one did . . . . but that ' s supposed to be a secret for now . she ' s supposed to surprise me and my father with shirts . . . . my mom is a loud mouth and spilled the beans though .
yeah . apparently she ' s just as bad as my sisters ' s mother in law . she spent a good amount of time complaining about it .
sounds wonderful ! nothing better than putting your feet up at the end of the day . think you might watch some tv ?
hope you have an enjoyable evening and relaxing sleep ! love me some tv too ! i ' m watch great food truck race tonight !
oh no ! i ' m sure it was awful at the time , but it ' ll be a good story when he grows up !
that is too funny . they ' ll grow out of it soon enough !
that sucks . what type of team ?
i ' m sorry .
that ' s amazing , how old is your son these days ?
that ' s nice that you can share things like that , it seems like your family is very close !
that sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient !
i am sure it will be fine ! it ' s not like you don ' t know where they live ha ##ha
i ' ve never cried at work , but i ' ve wanted to lo ##l .
yeah they can be . but , sometimes you just got to tough it out .
you ' re doing good .
lovely . i too love pets .
where did they go ?
oh that ' s nice , you guys get to throw a party if you want ha ##ha
i bet you ' ll do great . i would be nervous too . hopefully it won ' t be anything too serious and more cut and dry decision . have you gone before ?
i have never been before since i was either very ill or had babies / kids . good luck and don ' t stress too much . you ' ll be great !
i hate when they do that . they make it so hard to pay for
they sound like a shady hospital to me
oh boy . i know just how you feel . could you persuade them to go to a restaurant ?
good for you ! i ' d be so busy yelling at my husband i ' d forget to cook , lo ##l . do you know them well ?
well , that ' s at least something ! it ' s when he decides to invite the boss and his wife over when you ' d decided dinner was mac n ' cheese - that ' s when it gets hairy !
that would be scary ! were you able to catch her ?
that ' s good , there is nothing scar ##ier than a fur baby missing !
wow , that ##s so cool ! i wish i could rock climb .
i can understand that . i have ms so i ' m no stranger to auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases .
why did you lie to her ?
oh , well you a very naughty person .
that would be tough . i think i was one of the last one ' s not required to take foreign language .
i wish you the best in dealing with this .
i hear you on that . i ' m visiting my girlfriend , but she still has to work , so the weekend is really the only time we can hang out . do you have any special plans ?
that ' s a good idea . we actually did that last weekend . i guess it makes sense to do that as much as you can before summer is over . i hope you have a nice time !
oh my go ##sh , i feel the same to be honest . i hate , hate talking in front of a crowd .
i ' m sure you ' ll be fine , just try to practice as much as possible beforehand
i ' m sorry , but that made me laugh a little bit . i ' ve never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because they ' re so independent and determined to do whatever the want . doesn ' t seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them .
yeah , it works for some people . i ' m glad it works for you . i like my pets to be a little more needy and affection ##ate , but sometimes sas ##sy can be really fun and keep things interesting and lively .
that sounds exciting - where are you going ! ?
i love the beach , being on the gulf coast is probably my favorite . i hope you have a great time !
have you been reading reviews online ?
whoa . that sounds like a very nice computer . what a surprise . that should work out pretty well .
hey ! good luck to you ! that ' s got to be tough !
for what it ' s worth i ' m proud of you !
that is a pretty big decision to make . did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew she ' d eventually want ?
i hope you can figure out a way to make things work out ! sounds like you ' re stuck between a rock and a hard place .
that profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality . that ' s pretty cool that you took that route - - sometimes i think about the " what if " of if i took that route . pretty sure most people have that fantasy , but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it , like you
well , at the very least , from the little that you ' ve said , you seem very self - aware . that ' s a very under ##rated trait for people to have and to develop . . so whatever it is you decide , it seems like you ' ll be efficient at seeing it through . good luck !
o ##oh , that ' s awesome . it ' s great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things .
congratulations , i ' m glad to hear you ' ve been able to accomplish that for yourself . : )
i always wished i could do that with my dad . but he had a stroke in his 40 ##s , and was never in good enough health to do it with me . that and i was kind of shy and intro ##verted , so i never made friends to do it with , either . it stink ##s to miss the memories , but i ' m glad to hear you got to have them
maybe you can look forward to using it as motivation to doing those sorts of things with your kids in the future , if you choose to have them ?
just try and drive carefully then . maybe the weather will change by then
i am sure you will make it
fantastic , was it a lot ?
put it to some good use .
do you feel better now .
yeah . it happens to everyone whenever whether changes .
have you been studying ?
good luck , and i ' m sure if you prepared well and studied hard , you ' ll do great !
that ' s no good , what made you smoke ?
definitely , maybe some exercise and relaxation instead ?
i ' m an animal lover myself . i have a cat who just had four kitten ##s . they ' re adorable !
well that ' s very kind of you to help them out .
that ' s terrifying , are you okay ?
thankful that no one was hurt , did you call the police ?
ah , dan ##g , did he know you were trying to buy it also ?
well , maybe you can set a deal up with him and you can share it !
well you can imp ##rov ##ise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well !
yes . youtube will def have some awesome ideas . i could stand to get rid of this gut also . . ha ##ha ##ha ##h
oh wow ! that sounds scary ! i ' d be mad !
how annoying ! that sucks .
o ##i . . . i don ' t like doctors or the dentist ##s .
lo ##l ! i do not blame you , did you look up reviews ?
that is a stress we all go through ! it ' s hard !
oh no ! you don ' t have family ?
aw , i love pup ##pers ! what kind is it ?
aw , i ' m happy for you , they are really a joy and can make your life happier !
oh nice ! tell me about the new school ?
oh thank goodness . that common core is ridiculous .
fresh socks are a treat for the feet !
what does he do ?
lo ##l ! my mom used to do that with books , she would read the ending first .
nope she still reads it all . same thing you do silly ! lo ##l
oh that ' s great ! i got my cat a new bed and she won ' t touch it
that ' s so nice of you to do that for her . i have two dogs and they ' re pick ##y too .
aw ##w , i can see how that might make you feel really bad . was it replace ##able ?
that ' s a real bum ##mer . on the bright side , it taught your son that sometimes accidents happen and that ' s ok .
oh no ! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important
wow that is a really expensive tire ! !
woo ##ho ##o ! that sounds like it ' ll be a blast to drive !
just make sure you drive safely ! : )
i bet that was exciting to watch
i am sure he got some things from you
ah , i ' m sorry , well you can red ##eem your family and be a good influence to your community !
i bet you ' re a great person and don ' t worry about the past !
a good feeling about the weather ?
oh how neat ! i guess you must have sensed it !
that ' s neat ! where did you go ?
oh that sounds exciting ! i ' ve never had the chance to go to one .
maybe she will go easy on you , if this isn ' t something you do often .
you shouldn ' t steal things , especially non essential things like toys . but you probably know that .
wow , what did you do ?
it is what i thought . you did good .
you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesn ' t stop i would report it to the hr
i don ' t think you would make any problems . who knows maybe he is a per ##vert
oh no ! what happened ?
i am sorry to hear that . hopefully at least he is making progress
that ' s a wonderful thing to do . what kind of tasks do you do there ?
i ' m sure they appreciate having people to talk to who don ' t judge them negatively . we have a little " tent city " in our neighborhood and it was just announced that they ' re going to be removed . that makes me sad because there is a lack of shelters .
people think that people bring it on themselves , so many have a hard time sy ##mp ##athi ##zing .
temporary teeth ? how long do those last ?
ah yeah , that was a pretty good idea then . hopefully she can get some permanent ones soon !
yi ##kes . that is incredibly expensive for one tooth .
awesome ! congratulations ! i ' m sure you earned it .
it ' s good that they appreciate you and are kind enough to reward you for your efforts !
you ' re gonna miss the launch . what are you doing on here ?
have you been playing for a long time ?
i ' ve been playing since 2006 .
i hate to hear that . did the person that got the job deserve it ?
well , i have faith that you will find something just as good , keep your head up and keep trying .
where are you going ? are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place ?
i ' m sure you ' ll have a blast , i ' ve heard it ' s beautiful continent . and the food will be great !
maybe if you search some more it will go on sale . but if you really like it you should get it .
just think how happy it will make you feel each time you wear it .
oh ##hh i ' ve been checking it out too ! what side are you going with ?
lok ' tar og ##ar ! i love my undead nec ##rom ##ance ##r ! what race / class will you go with for alliance ?
oh man . that sucks . ny is really fun . why couldn ' t you go ?
i would be kind of mad and di ##ssa ##pp ##oint ##ed with him . you could have offered to pay your own way !
that ' s pretty cool ! was it a professional game ?
sounds like he ' s a good player ! you should ask him for some tickets !
aw man . i am guessing you already went to the store . did you have to interact with the manager ?
yeah that stink ##s . is it a store you go often ?
cong ##rat ##s ! i am also working hard at getting super fit too at 35 ! it is harder the older you are but totally do ##able if you ' re committed !
so true ! building muscle is great !
oh no , he ' s probably lost . maybe you should take him in and feed him .
at least you ' re concerned and interested in helping . some people would ignore the poor little kitty and just let him die . very kind of you !
if i had a huge yard , i ' d probably have an entire farm house from all the stray animals i see and feel bad for ! i can ' t help myself .
that ' s awesome . would have been a bum ##mer to come home to a messy house .
well it ' s good that you have such a great wife ! i hope you guys have an amazing life together .
congratulations , i ' m sure you will do great . it ' s always nerve - rack ##ing the first day of work !
good luck , and have fun . the money will just be a bonus !
why ' d you turn her down ?
well , props on you for being loyal . that shows a lot of character .
i did actually .
i ' m not even sure , maybe they had a deal in place with the school board ?
what kind of job is it ?
sounds like a promising job
i know . i just went yesterday !
i can ' t wait to move and have a hook up .
nice , that ' s very convenient , do you enjoy it ?
ha ##ha , she doesn ' t understand that you ' re at work !
mmm ##m , i love go ##ur ##met ice cream . if i didn ' t have self control i would be like 800 pounds from it .
you and me both , we need to hit the gym !
i love video games too , what ' s your favorite . i really like " don ' t star ##ve " by k ##lei .
o ##oo ##h my friends have been playing that , maybe i should get it too
oh no , that must have been pretty awful . do you not have self check ##out at your grocery store ?
if it makes you feel any better , i bet that happens a lot to the cash ##ier . they probably didn ' t think twice or care as long as you weren ' t a jerk .
i deal with anxiety myself , so i know not thinking about it is easier said than done . take care of yourself and try to find a good distraction to get your mind off it !
how are they ? are you doing pretty well in that area ?
that is awesome ! sounds like they are finely horned then !
fantastic ! being grateful is the way to be happy !
me too ! it ' s good when you have caring people around .
i love dogs , what kind of puppy is it ?
i have a pit myself , they are great dogs despite what people say about them
ye ##a , i enjoy stuff from my childhood . what kind of music are you listening to , country , rock , something else ?
that sounds like a really great time , i love those nos ##tal ##gic feelings you get from listening to stuff from your past .
i bet ! who do you think it ' s going to have the most separation anxiety , you or them ? be honest !
well stay strong ! for what it ' s worth , i moved schools a lot as a kid and yeah the first day is rough but kids adapt quickly . they might even make new friends right away !
that ' s terrible that you are being abused . who is treating you so poorly ?
if you guys are in an exclusive relationship , then that would be considered in ##fide ##lity . you should leave her and focus on yourself .
are you excited about it ?
what ##s new in the game ?
some people have no respect for other ##es .
are they like 1000 level classes ? if i was in a higher class i ' d of straight told them to quiet down .
yeah you ' ve still got some riff raf ##f around at that level . man . . . its been a long time but , i remember those days .
you should . i ran out of patience for that stuff real fast .
that ##s sick . did you report them ? they are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down
i would as that is a serious health hazard
end of summer cleaning , i know that feeling , got to get ready for the school year !
ah , i can imagine , winter ' s are brutal there i hear .
what do you have to speak on ?
my knees get weak when i try to publicly speak , it ' s bad .
that ' s nice , what kind of shoes are they ? heels ?
how fun ! i love shoes , i have at least 20 or 30 pairs in the house
wow , i hope you do get a nice bonus . sounds like you work pretty hard .
well , ill keep my fingers crossed for you .
that is so awesome . congratulations . any big plans to celebrate ?
that is very exciting .
u ##gh , that is so frustrating !
that is in ##fur ##iating . i know how costly healthcare is . such a shame that we as a country can ##t do better .
oh god . . i don ' t know how you military wives do it . i just can ' t imagine
i would be the same . i am a one person kind of gal . i don ' t do that even when i am single . the worry though must be hard !
that sounds so sweet . what was the occasion ?
i would be jealous of their strong love for one another .
where are they headed ?
some free time to yourself ! maybe you can catch up on some guilty pleasures ha ##ha
lo ##l ! i bet , how old are they ?
oh ##hh ! those times are nice . i only have a partner but i know i love my quiet mornings and my morning routine : )
aw , that ' s cute , how old is he / she ?
oh wow , that ' s adorable . i ' m sure its very fragile and cute , wish i could see it !
that sucks , do you plan on getting a new one ?
you should , my ipad has great charge time .
that ' s always a good feeling . if you don ' t feel confident going in , you ' re in trouble !
ah ##hh , calculus , i had a pretty hard time with that as well , some how i got a b and to be honest , i don ' t even know it .
aw ##w , that ' s sad . i love any and all animals , i ' m sorry
it can be tough losing a pet , keep your head up

oh i see , make sure to look at ex ##pr ##ia ##tian date next time : )
i ' m so sorry to hear that , it ' s always tough to lose a pet .

what is in ashe ##ville ?
oh that sounds very fun .
what kind of cereal was it
well that sounds disgusting
that is horrible . is it still under warrant ##y or anything like that ?
that is a rip off honestly ! i don ' t think i ' d buy that brand again .
i can imagine you do . do you have a needle fear ? even if you don ##t they still hurt

i have the same tub sitting in the attic . i have no idea what to do with all the photos ! are you creating col ##lage ##s or albums ?
aw ##w ##w ##w i would probably cry too ! scanning them seems like it would take forever . maybe see if there is a company you can send them to and they ' ll do it for you .
too hot outside ?
ye ##a yes that is a nice time of the year
where were you coming from ? . . . and how cheap was it ?
that ' s a steal .

oh ye ##a sounds like a great time of the year

i don ##t have kids , but i feel the same way u do if i had kids that is
that ##s the way it should be , they are the future
did you enjoy it ?

i hope everything goes well for you .
good luck and try to think about something else before then .
i have seen the preview ##s . is it good ?
murder can be interesting i guess
what were you expecting ?
it almost rained on me when i was walking home today .
that ' s unfortunate . you must have been lonely . has your situation improved since then ?
wow . . that ' s . . . sad .
can you go back and get it ?
might be worth it , rather than someone else picking it up .
what , did you catch them ?
damn you should have hunted them down
it might have been the same person ! we should stake out in the bushes out there and see who it was !
we ' ll get ta ##co bell and eat ta ##cos all night and when we catch them we ' ll make them watch us eat the ta ##cos and not share with them .
oh nice ! what was the occasion ?
happy birthday ! did you have fun at your party ?
what did you do ?
oh wow , do you have a backup job lined up ?
that ##s awesome
3rd time the charm ?
some people know they can do better so they shop around i guess .
i guess . or it could be they are ready to move on but need to know someone else will be interested in them .
i would have screamed !
when a cock ##ro ##ach comes in my house , the neighborhood knows it .
oh yeah i can see how it could be lonely . it ' s so quiet when they are gone .
yeah it is like an im ##balance in the house somehow .
what happened ?
i don ' t do haunted houses lo ##l
i would have dies
are you proud of her ?
what is she most talented at in school ?
never fun when someone tried to change your schedule . life ' s unfair sometimes .
well hopefully you were able to get some overtime pay .
i hate it . i want it to be 100 and humid all the time . i thrive in the heat
disco ##nne ##ct from what ? did you have a bad day ?
nice , how much do you bench ?

what are they getting treatment for
i hope you guys get through it
just say some prayers and be positive
what did they help them with , just how to do certain moves ?
yes , some are really good at helping others lose weight and feel good
that is very kind . now many people like that .
you will have to return the favor sometime .
do you usually sleep in ? i heard it ' s better to wake up naturally .
well maybe you will be able to start a new habit of waking up without it .
i sure do ! what are some of your favorites ?
oh yeah those will do that . i still have like 40 of them on vc ##r or video cassette , whatever those things were called . i doubt i would be able to find one these days that would actually play them @
how did you guys end up meeting ?
that makes sense , when did you first meet up in person ?
what did you see ?
i hear that movie is great
that would be a dream
that is a place i have always wanted to go to

oh that ' s always tough , are you nervous ?
i can understand , if you try to think positively it might help
when will it be released ? i have not heard of that one .
i am sure you will have a lot of fun when it comes out .
have you checked your lease agreement , they may be required by law to follow through .
yeah , i would show up at the office and show them exactly where they promised to take care of you . that should work .
i ' m sorry but i ' m so not a fan of meat ##lo ##af . do you have a good recipe ?
hmm that might actually be good , i think it ' s the ke ##tch ##up that i don ' t like about meat ##lo ##af . bon app ##eti ##t !
why were you scared ?
did you sneak away from them ?
who did she beat down ?
oh , lay the smack down
yeah that ' s a bad habit . i don ' t like it either .
lo ##l , he is just like my brother . you should ignore him , just like i ignore my bo ##rth ##er
that ' s impressive , how did you do ?
i don ' t think i could do it .
i keep forgetting that football season is right around the corner . did you play when you were younger ?
spending time with your parents and watching games can create great memories !
really ? why is that ?
wow . . . i kinda hope they get fired . why did you need to talk to the landlord ?
are you okay with that
have you talked to her about it
aw ##h , i ' m sorry . what happened ?
well at least you know what to do next time . i ' m sure you ' ll rock it then !
what church do you go to ?

that is never a good thing
what did he do ?
that ' s so awful , what is your dogs name ?
oh ye ##a ?
what ended up happening
how long have you been working for the company ?
i think you will do okay ! get as much rest as possible tonight just in case they do an interview !
that is indeed a bum ##mer . maybe you can pick some up on a ticket trading website ?
seriously . it ruins it for the real fans .
maybe you should go somewhere else
yeah you would think they would be good by now
i have never been to church , but i understand where your coming from
maybe one day ill go , its just the way i was brought up religion was not something my family made me follow
that must ' ve been awful .
how old was she when she passed ?
they really are . what is your favorite
those are good too . i never saw that one
o ##oh congratulations , what for ?
best of luck with that raise . cong ##rat ##s to you !
are you excited ?
i hope you enjoy art class that was always my favorite .
oh no ! who is matt ##y ?
oh my . . i am so sorry . i hope you find her soon !
do you live in a bad area or a big city ?
your safe in the woods . most animals are more scared of you . what scared you ?
if you have to leave just be very careful on the road .
leave early and drive slower than normal . just watch out for other drivers .
what kind of job is it
that sounds like a good one
what kind of animal is it ?
wow that ' s so cool , those are a type of rep ##tile right ?
when does it come out ? i wanna get that too and the new online service
ah that sounds about right
yeah , that ' s definitely not ok . have you thought about contact ##ing a tenants rights group to advocate on your behalf ?
in some cases you can even legally with ##hold rent if they aren ' t doing their duty as a landlord . i ' d definitely check out what you can do !
that sounds very dangerous
that would help a lot
that ' s great . i bet he worked hard for it .
i am happy for him ! it is always nice to see people reaching their goals .
i need to start playing too , that would be awesome
it would be a great life , hope you do eventually win
never seen it . don ##t like scary movies much
that ##s cool
i ' m sorry to hear that ! what ' s stopping you from taking the trip ?
well , hopefully you can make arrangements to take the trip another time . it ' s hard to find a new job !
i guess that means they were good at least
that sounds like a good idea
are you looking forward to it or nah ?
well good . then good luck tomorrow and knock ' em dead !

i ' m sorry that ' s awful i bet he ' s sad .
that is awesome ! i know how hard it is to lose weight . she must be so happy .
i feel you . that ' s how my body functions too . slow weight loss or not at all . its also dangerous to lose weight too quickly so don ' t wish it for yourself too fast . slowly and steadily keeps you from getting lose skin or gaining it all back too .
i used to have the same problem , i ' d always hear a bunch of sp ##ook ##y noises after everyone left .
i worked night shift alone in an office and i ' d always hear foot steps in the hallway

that ' s pretty scary , hopefully they can get him some med ##s and he gets to come home .
that ' s so exciting ! how did it go ?
that is amazing ! you must feel pretty proud of her .
oh wow i didn ##t even know they go for that long . i hope all goes well for you all !
well is he going back ?
oh no . what happened ? is your dog okay ?
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! i assume you don ' t have a chip implant ##ed to track it ? that ' s awful , i ' d be furious !
wow that would scare me too . what caused it ?
sorry to hear that you ' re in that situation . hope you stay safe
oh no ! is she stressed about something ?
ah ##h , that could be it . sometimes when my cat is stressed she po ##ops or throws up .
that ' s awesome . maybe you have natural talent for it and should try to become a singer !
you could always post videos to social media in your spare time and see how well received it is . many people have made it big starting out that way .
oh no , what happened ?
that is so sad , i hope you find him .
how long is gr ##ad school ?
that ##s not bad , good luck
hey good for you ! plenty of good boys and girls there ?
yeah but at least they get to see you often so you can give them some love and pets !
that ' s awesome ! keep up the good work , my friend : d

how did you meet them ?
it ' s always nice to go somewhere you can meet a lot of new people .
i would be too , were you in a shopping center ?
people are so careless .
oh that ##s cool
how old is he
i have never even heard of that movie , but i ' m sure it would scare me . i have never watched a horror movie in my life , and i won ' t
yeah , i get scared easily by everyday things i don ' t need to help my imagination along . what do you do to keep yourself from thinking about it ?
what did you say >
that is nasty , but some people just do not care
when does it come out ?
i would love to play with you sometime .
what team is that ?
oh , i am sorry to hear that
what makes you say that ?
i bet it felt really good to let that all out and to still be accepted by her .
did you give her stuff back
she knows it was you ?
what happened ?
good luck for this weekend .
that happened to me a couple months ago . it was a brand new tire which really sucked
was there construction going on near your house ? someone had done work on my roof and i think maybe the nail in my tire came from there .
well happy birthday ! did you have a nice time ?
oh no ! i hope you feel better now and that you had a good time while you were on the trip at least .
i do . why do you say that about her ?
that ' s terrible . her kids are going to res ##ent her .
were you alone ?
i don ' t blame you , i would be scared too . it seems like you got home alright though , so that is good .
that ##s cool . what kind of car are you getting
oh wow !
sounds like it was a great trip and good memory to have , do you have a family of your own to take them on the same disney cruise ?
lo ##l maybe one day your son is still small you have lot ' s of time to save , i think i will look into it for me and my family for our next vacation .
should you call the police or something ? i hate being home alone for this exact reason .
or a cat maybe ? maybe you should look into installing those motion flood lights or something so that you feel safer when you are home alone .
i don ' t think i have ever had some , what is it ?
that sounds delicious , you are making my mouth water . have fun this weekend . . . i know you will !
oh no . why are you nervous ?
i hope it ' s just something you ' re eating .
i am so sorry to hear that , that ' s such a hard decision to make .
i will hug my kitty just a little closer just knowing how short our time together is . sending you love and healing !
maybe he doesn ' t sleep . some people just have their lives together . can ' t relate ha ##ha
maybe it ' s add ##eral ##l ? it ' s very popular in schools
really ? what is your favorite ice cream ?
those sounds delicious . i should go get some before the summer ends !
lo ##l i know you was bad he may need to watch what he eats or at least warn you next time .
if y ' all ate something green like vegetables that could be the reason keep the spray close next time .
are you excited about it or not really ?
that ' s awesome then . i hope your trip will be a fruit ##ful one !
that is nice . are you going alone ?
i hope you have a good time .
did you end up finding anything eventually or no ?
at least you ' re nice and comfortable on the couch ?
me too ! they are the best ! little mermaid ! beauty and the beast ! what ' s your favorite if you can pick ?
ha ha , that ' s a great one . did disney do flu ##bber ?
wow , great job friend , that is no easy feat !
good , use it as a cat ##apa ##ult , that is a great idea !
you will be ok . just prepare for it and it will go great .
don ##t psyche yourself out . just be confident and yourself .
that sounds pretty serious . what did she do ?
did your mother - in - law report her to the police ?
that ' s absolutely disgusting ! what did you do ?
that sounds terrible . i really hope your future excursion ##s are dung free !
what did you tell him that happened ?
didn ' t he call and ask your brother ?
i hear you , are you getting the day off of work ?
that sounds awesome . where are you going ?
is that good or bad ?
good , enjoy it when you get it , that is what i say
that ' s what we called as family . good that you ' ve good family .
yeah ! my family is everything to me !
i think i can understand that . it was a bit simpler than all this adult ##ing we have to do .
you and me both ! my kids are almost raised and i ' ll probably go back to work soon , but would actually love a different degree now . it ' s never too late to go back you know .
she sounds like an amazing person , but the li ##ce is no bu ##eno .
oh wow . i didn ' t know it could spread like that .
while ram ##en is amazing , i agree , it might be time to try something new .
heck , i lived on that stuff in college . i was an iron chef at ram ##en cooking back in the day
what are you guys betting on ?
ha ##ha ##ha so how long is it now ?
wow impressive ! you must be very proud .
so what ' s next for her ? i imagine with that great gp ##a she has many options to choose from .
wow i would be furious , what did you do ?
oh , that sucks , best of luck finding a good laptop !
i am so sorry to hear that . are you with family ?
ye ##a . it helps to not isolate yourself . sometimes when people go through a loss like that , they isolate themselves and it just makes you feel worse .
oh , i am sorry to hear that , maybe next time !
yeah , you gotta look on the bright side sometimes
oh no . how old was she when she passed ?
oh that ' s still pretty young .
lo ##l maybe you need to practice more !
yeah cooking is so much fun . especially when you try out different things !
why ? what ' s happening this weekend ?
oh sweet . is this your first time ?
i ' m sorry to hear that .
what happened to the other guy ?
oh no . that ' s not good !
have you had high blood pressure for a while now ?
that is awesome , what is your field of study ?
that is great . is it a big firm ?
aw ##w that ' s sweet ! what movie ?
oh wow ! so you have been for a long time ?
that ' s terrifying ! i had that happen near me before too . two guys screaming at each other arguing in the road . i ' m glad you ' re okay .
that ' s great that you have flood lights . i really need to get at least one since we ' re on the corner of the street . glad they app ##re ##hend ##ed them ! crazy people !
i hate it when that happens ! i bet you were frustrated that all that work wa ##as gone .
that ' s a lot to lose , you ' d think that with technology what it is there would be some sort of auto ##sa ##ve function on everything you do .
oh boy , that ' s not a good start .
ha ##ha ##ha i think we ' ve all done that . it ' s just the first day anyway .
are you nervous ?
i always make a first date a group one . easier to get out that way lo ##l
really ? what else is he going to do ?
he can ' t coach the giants lo ##l
how old are you now ?
you should still do stuff , your not that old .
when children di ##sa ##pp ##oint us , it can be particularly upset ##ting . what did he do ?
you don ' t deserve that ! he ' s lucky to have someone cooking for him !
oh well good for him ! i don ' t see many older people actually making an effort to ' fool around ' with technology , they all get too frustrated with it
that ##s awful , if i were there and he crossed the line , i would speak to someone above him about it .
aw ##w that sounds adorable ! is he getting to big boy age ?
ha ##ha ##ha oh no . the adventures of being a parent lo ##l .
do you have a fast metabolism then ? i wish i had that !
make sure you have routine physical ##s so that you can get anything else that might need to be adjusted fixed , etc . . but you are right , at least you don ' t have to worry about weight .
i " m so sorry to hear that . she must ' ve been devastated .
i am so sorry to hear that . she might be hard to be around , but i hope you spend some time with her .
wow . cong ##rat ##ual ##ations . do you think she is expecting it ?
what is the plan ?
most people are dread ##ing it . how come you ' re looking forward to it ?
oh ye ##a ! congratulations !
what made you come to that decision , i get angry when people leave carts close to others cars .
maybe it was a honest mistake then since she was elderly i see why you didn ' t want to give her up .
that ' s not good . pro ##cr ##ast ##ination can lead to a lot of stress .
hopefully she will learn quickly that it ' s better to get her school work done quickly
dan ##g ! ask her out !
alright alright , you can go the slow route
that is amazing ! so many people do not stay married these days , you should be proud of that accomplishment !
it ' s 100 % for both of you ! it takes two to tango you know - cong ##rat ##s on 35 years !
that is not fun . do the police have any leads ?
that is a good thing . have you thought about getting a camera and posting that you have one on the property .
what happened ?
oh no . that is pretty bad . do you know who she is that you could go and leave her a tip ? mistakes happen and there ' s not much you can do .
oh man that ' s terrible : ( i ' m so sorry .
yeah . my grandmother was like that too . the backbone of the family . we all went our separate ways pretty much after she died . don ' t let that happen to your family !
that ' s great to hear ! will you be in the ceremony ?
i ' m so happy for you ! i am sure it will be a wonderful day for both of you !
ut oh . . what is your favorite ? i like so many i can ' t pick just one .
i haven ' t tried that one yet i will now . i love blue ##berries . . and i like che ##x .
why is he in the ic ##u ?
i ' m sorry , i hope he recover ##s !
what does that mean ? a raise at work ?
oh . congratulations !
you should hook up with somebody then ! !
it is not ! ! but you got to give it a try
that really stink ##s . you didn ' t go with them ?
ah . well , i suppose it ' s a good thing you didn ' t know him . less heart ##ache for you , i suppose .
that ' s great , how do you feel about it ?
congratulations then . what kind of job is it ?
congratulations on that . you truly did it . age is just a number . i hope you have your whole life ahead of you yet
it is almost over . senior year is the final one and it will pass quickly . been there , done that
you will . being prepared always helps
that ##s right . i think you got it already . you know exactly what to do
that is true for some
if you love each other and stay close you will be fine .
i agree . that happened to me and i had to stop watching them . i worry too much about it happening to me or , even worse , my kids .
i know . hearing statistics doesn ' t help either . crazy people doing things every 3 seconds .
some men are such animals . is she very attractive ?
that
dan ##g , that must have been difficult to clean up , what did you eat after that ?
ram ##en , ah you must be in college ?
i bet that is kind of sad to see it go .
where will the current students of that school go ?
that ' s nice to hear ! what ' s going on in your life ?
so many people just want more and more . i think you got it right .
i hope it will come better and it will ! !
you must have been very careful with the do ' d and don ' ts ! !
oh no . accidents happen . i feel really sorry for the dog .
did you go back ?
dan ##g that sara ! did you tell her how unhappy you were with her ?
yeah i understand . maybe you should pay her back somehow .
put sugar in her salt shake ##r next time you ' re at her house : d
lo ##l . good luck ! glad you made it home safe : )
oh no . . . what did you do ?
yes . i love egg ##pl ##ant ! how could you find that really gross ?
ha ##ha ##ha , well to each their own , because i love how egg ##pl ##ant is mu ##sh ##y .
yeah , and i don ' t think you can ever go wrong with deep fried food . anything deep fried is delicious : d
that ' s really good ! is he very smart ?
i wish the best for your son . i am sure he will do well wherever he goes .
are you confident you will pass ?
well you got this then
everything happens for a reason
right , nothing can take that aw ##y
i used to like watching scary movies . not my thing anymore .
maybe you can talk yourself out of it ?
im sorry to hear that
that ##s a good way to think about it
i ' m sorry to hear that . why did you miss seeing her ?
aw no . maybe you should tell her that , so next time she ' ll come when you have time ?
i bet they will be a lot better , i heard vegetarian helps a lot with that .
the only negative effect i ' ve read is the lack of protein , but i ' m sure there are substitutes !
oh goodness ! i ' m glad you are ok , what happened ?
wow ! that person needs to loose their license i believe - you are so blessed you were not hurt .
congratulations ! marriages take work but it is totally worth it when you have a good partner . did you do anything special for the anniversary ?
i ' ve never been on one either , but that sounds like so much fun . have a good time !
why is he not asleep ?
he will learn with age .
why ?
in a school zone ? that ##s not good
oh why ! ! do you guys support separate teams ! !
poor him ! ! you should have bee angry or furious ! !
what kind of cancer ?
you gotta have some faith .
that is horrible , but i ' ve been there myself . it ' s hard to not be upset about it .
i know what you mean , it is hard . the only advice i have is that god is always there even when no one else is .
i miss my dad . . been so long . what did you guys talk about ?
my mom had alzheimer ##s . . it sucks !
me either ! do you have any plans ?
that ' s sounds like a blast ! i ' ve never been courageous enough to attempt that .
what prompted you to do that ? did you tell someone and clear your conscience ?
best thing you can do is tell the truth and clear it up . its not worth it and you only cheat yourself . you can do it and you ' ll feel better .
oh that so sad ! ! did you try searching him everywhere ! !
om ##g ! ! you would have been devastated ! !
that is too bad . are they okay ?
oh that is horrible ! i cannot imagine what he must be going through !
how come ? what year did you join ?
oh that ' s nice , yeah it ' s a good feature of facebook
cool . are you in charge ?
sounds like a lot of work ahead
i ' m sorry you don ' t feel well , is it a cold or something more serious ?
i hope you feel better before this big meeting - or maybe you can res ##ched ##ule it or something .
what are you going to do ?
i love cruise , i go on at least one every year .
legs weak arms are heavy ?
oh .
that ' s great , what job is it ?
i have never met someone who has done that for a job .
are you a birthday clown ?
wanna invest in a clown ?
do you feel bad for teasing him ?
yeah , it ' s funny how drastically people can change as they grow .
did you get a chance to talk to them yet , and introduce yourself ?
have you considered getting back at them by prank ##ing them ?
that ' s so awesome ! are they adopting domestically or abroad ? my husband and i tried to adopt from japan but our paperwork expired before we could and then i got pregnant . i hope it goes well for them !
it will be so worth it when that child is in their arms ! i ' m so happy for them and the child they are saving !
what do you think you are going to do , are you going to talk to him and find out ?
or you could find out he has a thing for you ! i hope either way that it works out for all of you .
oh , have you done this before ?
wow , good luck sounds real ##y hard to me .
hey that ' s amazing ! ! ! you don ' t see that often these days
you got that right ! good job : d what do you all do these days ? anything fun ?
what was in there ?
nice ! ! ! nothing better than getting money in the mail !
i am sure you are looking forward to it . what don ' t you like about it ?
sorry about your bad luck . glad you are getting out of that place !
will you be in trouble for not reins ##tat ##ing it ?
i hope it works out for you .
did anything get stolen ?
i ' m glad they didn ' t run away .
oh me . too . . what ##s the cr ##azi ##est thing you remember happening ?
that ##s funny . i never did anything that daring !
awesome ! what are your vacation plans ?
oh man , i ' m jealous . have fun and don ' t forget to wear suns ##creen !
are you excited ?
me too . i have three kids too
are you serious ? there ' s a noise ordinance for no loud noise or music after 10 : 00 ##p . m . !
you might have to call the cops just to get sleep ! horrible . sorry .
i ' m so sorry you are going through this . maybe it would be a good thing to get a therapist so that you have someone that can help you through it .
well , i hope you do find that special someone , and that the stress at work lets up a bit as well .
congratulations on that . that is a great life milestone for her . is she planning on getting into a college ?
sounds great . i wish all the best in her future endeavors .
did it get worse or better ?
that ' s horrible , you should set up an app that lets your family track you
that sucks
you h ##vent taken anything yet ?
that was very generous of you .
i hope so too . there ' s nothing worse than someone you trust not repay ##ing you .
what is it ?
oh yeah that really do grind ! !
aw ##w that ' s awesome ! did you take a day off and go through them for the memories ? ? ?
yeah i ' m so happy for you ! i need to go through some of my old stuff ! !
oh no ! were you upset about it ?
i am sorry that happened i would be upset too !
that is very di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful , especially since he is not in a stand - alone home . can you tell your landlord about it ?
that is just crazy ! i hope he stops really soon - or you can figure out how to cut the power off on his side - lo ##l !
that is so exciting ! what torture waiting for a whole year ! where are you going ?
so fun ! hope you have a great time !
cake always hits the spot when you have a sweet tooth . was it from a birthday ?
mode ##ration is key , so you don ' t get sick !
dan ##g ! that ' s like a 13 year old gets an extra mo ##zz stick and ska plays in his head !
i gotta go to mcdonald ' s more often to cash in on these free nu ##gg ##ets !
e ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w ! was it a run ##ny po ##op or a solid po ##op ?
yeah i would have totally done the same . that ' s why i don ' t want a dog lo ##l !
oh i bet ! did you move far away ?
wow ! why did you move so far ?
i am so sorry . did they give you another one for free ?
i would feel they same way , but that was nice of them !
why did you feel like you needed to steal candy ?
stealing very rarely is worth it , that doesn ' t stop people from doing it .
lo ##l . . . . best thing to do when that happens is deny , deny , deny .
smart move on your part .
did they hit you ?
i know what you mean , i would have been pissed ! probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me !
what did she bring back ?
wow that ' s awful , i had li ##ce in school .
on social media ? or on the tv ?
i ' ve never really watched youtube that much , i ' m not sure what i ' d even watch on there . but i know what you mean , the content can be pretty des ##pic ##able .
i did that too ! i remember it was a package of big league chew . my mom took me back to the store and made me talk to the manager . did you have to do that as well ?
i ' m not sure what 5 is , but it ' s a good story to tell your kids if you have any . i ' ve told both of mine , and they luckily have not done the same thing .
have you found any good ones ?
nice ! it ' s always good to sit around a tell the tales of your youth to our children : )
wow , how amazing ! i love surprise parties . did you get a lot of good stuff ?
that is awesome , i mean the gifts are nice , but it ' s even better to know that you ' ve got people that love and care about you .
aw , i am sorry to hear that . is she still alive and well ?
aw ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w poor little dogg ##ie . i am sure she is chasing around mail ##men happily in dogg ##y heaven .
did you nurse her back to health and get some weight on her ?
i bet she was so tiny ! i ' m glad you found her and were able to take care of her .
oh no , it really sucks seeing someone you care about date someone who isn ' t good
i bet if you say anything about it , you ' re the bad one too
that ' s really rough man . is there any way you can get her back ?
i am sure you ' ll find somebody in due time . it took me 6 years to find someone after my last relationship , but it happened . it ' ll happen to you too !
those good old times of fantasy . kid ' s world is so full of imagination and self - scar ##ing created things
here is an idea . why don ' t you get yourself a teddy bear by your side when sleeping . he will protect you
oh no ! how old is he / she ?
yeah i understand . is there anywhere you can take it to get it fixed ?
now why is it going to be scary ? going to a haunted house ?
for what ? hall ##ows ##cre ##am at busch gardens ? ! ? ! ? if so , that place is a blast .
oh no ! that is one of my biggest fears ! what did you do ?
i sure hope you get to keep your job . i know it was a big accident , but it was an accident .
oh no , i know that is so disappointing first hand . the same thing has happened to me for the last three years . is everything going well , though ?
that is a real bum ##mer . maybe you can have a makeup vacation in september .
i hope it went well ! ! she is alright now right ?
that ' s just nice of you ! ! helping out your sister ! !
cong ##rat ##s ! that is great news !
i bet ! you deserve to be proud and excited though . you have worked hard for this .
that ' s so scary ! i hope your dog is ok .
i can imagine . glad you are both alright .
eh , you ' ll get there eventually . besides , big houses aren ' t even that great ! all you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably .
and that ' s the best part . many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt . it causes a lot of stress .
well , since he ' s supposed to be in the water , you may have a fatal ##ity on your hands .
yeah , you ' d better find him like quick ! or flood your house until you do - either way . .
i love animals too . what are their names ?
that is such a unique name i love it .
ah that ' s so terrible . did you find him ?
i think it becomes a practice for him ! !
that ' s terrible . did he get hurt ?
man , i am truly sorry . if i knew you , i would definitely help you out .
oh no ! do you have any other work lined up ?
i hope everything works out for you , i know how hard shut downs can be .
that ' s so nice . i ' ve done that a few times and really enjoyed it
and you ' re doing something amazing !
oh that is the worst . it really puts you on edge . what will happen if it doesn ' t come on time ?
i really hope that it comes on time . it can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans .
sorry to hear that . have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss ?
hopefully this type of situation doesn ' t happen again . that really is disappointing how the system doesn ' t protect the employees about that type of situation .
that is funny what did she do ?
that is amazing i guess she deserves to be spoon fed !
that sounds relaxing
i hope you have many more
u ##gh , that ' s always the worst . i hope it wasn ' t something urgent you were waiting on ?
yeah , i ' ve had them do that to me before too . it ' s a pain in the ke ##ester .
om ##g . . . i know what you mean . i can ' t stand for anything to crawl on me or near me . did you see any ?
lo ##l . . . . their waiting for you to let your guard down and then they will attack you .
oh my god ! i have the hee ##bie ##jee ##bies just thinking about it ! did it attack you ? ! ? !
i am glad to hear you are alright . but i would still be on the look out for next time . . . they are the relatives of godzilla after all .
wow you must be so proud !
i hope he keeps it up !
i ' m sorry , that ' s quite disgusting .
that is a major issue .
nice ! i am glad to hear that you got to use your bay ##watch - esq ##ue skills !
that ' s great man . you just have to wrestle a few sharks and they ' ll appoint you head life ##guard of the state .
i don ' t know if that is a good thing or a bad thing , but either way it is epic .
it is hard to recover from a bing ##e like that , but do a few thousand situ ##ps and you ' ll be good as new !
that really sucks . did you make it up to your co - worker ?
that ' s good to hear that you and your co - worker mad amend ##s . live and learn !
whoa ! did you have a strong craving or something ?
that ' s okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment .
oh , that must be stress ##ful . do you think he is going to be fine ?
oh , that must be stress ##ful . do you think he is going to be fine ?
all you must have been proud of yourself
that ' s so terrible . how could they ditch you ! !
that is pretty awesome , was it something you really wanted ?
you should write a good review , sounds like they know what they are doing .
that ' s kinda terrible . did you apologize to him ?
well , as long as you did and the wife doesn ' t know , you ' re in the clear !
oh no , that ' s ter ##ib ##ble
he should do his work properly . he is such a naughty boy to do on the rug ! !
dan ##g ! i bet that feeling felt incredible ! did you guys celebrate ?
well , that ' s kinda me ##h . but congratulations still !
that is awesome . is this for college ?
you must be feeling great . what are you studying ?
i am an officer in the united states navy , but i agree with you . how about yourself ?
i have sailed all over the glove . hit a couple of countries in europe , a few scattered islands across the atlantic . and the best part is , i ' ve never been deployed ! so i am truly living the dream that every sailor hopes for lo ##l . i was very fortunate .
awful . i ' m so sorry . have you tried putting up posters ?
no doubt he will when he gets cold and hungry .
that ' s great ! what was it ?
he will be rich one day !
that was rude of them . did you beat their face in ?
i would be too . did you tell the manager ?
ah yes ! how did it make you feel ?
that ' s awesome ! did it bright ##en your day ?
o ##oo ##h free from what ?
wow that ' s awesome ! to the beach ?
congratulations ! do you feel relieved to be done with school ?
what did you study ?
awesome ! so you ' d recommend it if i were looking for a new phone ?
i ' ve never been a phone of apple anyway . i had the first iphone and wasn ' t impressed so i never tried again .
great idea . where are you planning on visiting ?
why don ' t you take them to six flags . it is more fun and full of exciting experiences rushed with adrenaline
o ##oh , that ' s exciting . what did he say ?
wow , that ' s amazing , ha ##ha . so fancy .
that must have been fun to go through and remember the good old days .
i love going through old memories and re ##li ##ving the glory days . are you still friends with some of the folks you knew back then ?
if you keep doing them you ' ll look better !
maybe you should go on a diet so you don ' t feel sick : d
yeah , i wish i had a nice car too .
it would be nice to have money like that .
that was really nice of your neighbor . i wish i had one like that
good you should be for having such a bless ##es neighbor
that is so cool !
that is crazy ! most kids first words are " money " .
pretty sa ##v ##vy place ! were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours , squat ##ting for free internet ?
that ' s great ! i go there almost every single day and get a bread bowl !
i too feel your pain . i broke my diet by eating 4 dozen don ##uts in one sitting .
we ' ll get back on the horse together , my friend . skin ##nier days are ahead of us !
that sounds like a nice and relaxing day . what book were you enjoying ?
it ' s really cool to have those moments where you get to enjoy what you like to do .
wo ##ah how did you manage to eat 12 pizza ##s
oh oh . it ' s alright next time you should be bit careful not eat a lot
oh man ! a rookie mistake ! did your date notice the foul stench ?
well , i guess it didn ' t turn out too bad . are you guys going for another ?
wo ##ah really nice ! ! what and all they did
you must have really enjoyed it
i know ! it ' s terrible everywhere ! and i ' m the only one who knows how to drive because i created the automobile !
u ##gh . the horn is the worse ! especially those loud , ob ##no ##xious semi - truck horns !
are you baking ? what did you burn .
that is pretty unfortunate . you should be like me and just buy them , always easier when someone else does the work .
that ' s really gross . did you say anything to him about it ?
for sure . that really isn ' t something a normal person should be doing . or anyone for that matter .
wow , that is really impressive !
they would be very jealous !
three weeks to what ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?
awesome ! where are you going ?
lo ##l hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours
maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard ! !
really ? what was it , that must of been pretty wild .
hmm , that is a pretty epic first world . you would think that would be a little two difficult for a first word . the kid must be a genius
i hope too ! ! i think you will do well ! !
om ##g ! ! millionaire that works at mcdonald ##s . i would like to see you work
dan ##g . do you have the whole house to yourself ?
that ' s really rough . maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends ?
that is funny . dogs can be careless . you should take better care of it
you seem to be very fed up with him . how long have you had him ?
it makes me feel the same . that ' s why i voted for myself in the last election .
truly unacceptable . we would be better off with chi ##mp ##an ##zee ##s in office .
that man is a winner if he kept it all down !
i am really amazed . was it you ?
i ' m sorry that keeps happening to you .
i agree , your talents would be better suited elsewhere .
that is pretty un ##lu ##cky . at lease it wasn ' t a power out ##age though .
it ' s like 100 degrees during the day , you would have had to find a pool to jump in .
that ' s terrible ! is it a fest ##ering wound that will turn you into a zombie ?
nonsense ! if you ' re a zombie , you ' ll be brain ##less and the scar will be the least of your worries !
you must be really excited of the interview and i hope you will do well
you will nail it . just be confident and just be yourself ! !
that is so exciting ! what did he say ?
that is so cute ! be sure and jo ##t that down in the baby book !
dan ##g , that ' s rough . are you set up for next month at least ?
that ' s great man . at least you ' ll have a place to stay for the next month .
that ' s so nice of them . where did they find it ?
that ' s a surprise and it ' s after 5 long years
that ' s terrible ! did you manage to find it ?
that sucks man . do you have another grandma who can give you a new one ?
oh no ! ! that ' s just terrible . did you made him to clean by himself ! !
naughty dog . he should look after himself
really ? i ' m thinking about buying one myself . what kind are you getting ?
nice . i have my eye on a tesla .
awesome , do you think you are prepared for it ?
just take deep breaths and act confidently and you ' ll do great !
that is indeed pretty gross . perhaps you should help her clean it up ?
i don ' t blame you , but we have to help our struggling siblings out !
i ' m sorry to hear that , that ' s got to be tough on you .
mine died a couple years ago and i still think of her . : (
what kind of website are you planning on designing ?
nice ! perhaps i can go buy a car on the website one day !
holy cow that ' s amazing ! that ' s awesome of you ! !
that ' s the cool ##est thing i ' ve heard all day
that is such a great age . is he doing well ?
what position does he play ?
hmm ##m . have you asked to go over for a dip ? he never said you couldn ' t come over and part ##ake in the fun !
i am sure ! please let him know that i am game to come over for a pool party !
ru ##h ro ##h ! did it come out of the rug easily ?
yeah , that ' s never a good experience . coming home to that smell and mess , u ##gh !
wow , that ' s awful . why did he do that ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he can get the help he needs .
you should get some bug spray . fly ' s are nasty
i once chased a fly around my room for 30 min ##s , never caught it , i think it was all in my head ?
same , my friend ! france played so well .
i do hope you rubbed it into your co - workers ' faces like i did !
ah , happy birthday in advance to you . and what ' s the plan
they definitely will get you a rum cake
used to be ? what happened to it ? did it get closed down ?
that sounds alarm ##ing . you better be careful next time visiting the place . they maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities
that would get very irritating . have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel ?
that ##s too bad . i am sure it makes things very stress ##ful and difficult .
ah , you are going to miss him
i feel sorry for you . i just hope you guys at ##lea ##st meet now and then ! !
i am so happy for you !
just be a good husband and you should be fine .
i have no idea . what happened ?
oh thank goodness you weren ' t late .
does it bother you when she does that ?
it can really be annoying when someone tells you what to do . have you talked to her about it ?
did you just clean your place ?
mmm ##m , i love that brown ##ie smell . also nothing better than fresh brown ##ies .
only you can change that , my friend !
hey that ' s great ! you should take a before picture today and an after picture one month from now !
that ' s terrible . have you gone to a dentist to get it checked out ?
i would be terrified too . you have to do get it checked out !
are you nervous ?
don ' t be ! ! you will do well . just be yourself ! !
that is not good , i don ' t think i ##gua ##na ' s can live out in the wild .
maybe you should lay out some bait , he has to get hungry sometime .
that must be great !
he sounds like an excellent boss !
oh no , that is embarrassing . were you able to recover by the end ?
i am so sorry that happened to you . will you get another crack at it sometime ?
i ' m sorry .
you must be very comfortable in your office ! how did they react ?
i am sorry that you now live in in ##fa ##my . maybe , with time , they can learn to forgive you .
aw yeah ! what year are you in college ?
just make sure you focus on getting good grades !
aw i hate to hear that . i also hope she feels better . i love my dog so much .
i hope it all turns out well with good news there !
that ' s amazing ! which word did he choose ?
om ##good ##ness ! i don ' t think i ' ve even used flaming ##o in a sentence myself in a long time ! he ' s clearly a prodigy !
that ' s pretty neat . did you buy anything cool ?
that ' s so cool ! sounds like a store you would find in dai ##ago ##n alley !
that must bring up scary memories .
i ' m sorry you didn ' t grow out of it .
that ' s scary ! did you chase it away and show it who ' s boss ?
i would have done the same . never know if the thing is going to bite off your belly ##bu ##tton or not .
oh no ! i hate when that happens ! does it still hurt ?
sorry to hear that ! definitely need to make sure it doesn ' t fall off !
i imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you . did you see any ghosts ?
nice ! what kind of pizza was it ?
that ' s awesome , i bet she loves you just as much !
aw , that ' s adorable , sounds like you guys will have a great life together !
e ##w ##w ##w ##w . maybe you should put them back in the oven for a big ##t ?
ha ##ha ! did you just eat a bunch of mu ##sh ##y brown ##ies ?
better hop on the elliptical for a little longer tomorrow ! worth it !
why not ?
oh no , that ' s awful . maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later .
that ' s awesome ! what type of work will you be doing ?
hope you enjoy it !
wow , that ' s quite a feat . did he get sick ?
yeah i ' d be tempted to bar ##f myself witnessing that .
oh that ' s great ! what job is it ?
she must be really smart !
that would be nerve rack ##ing , but also fun i think .
do you have a job lined up already ?
well you are ahead of the game , more so than most people .
how nice of you to loan it out ! have to admit , never heard of someone " borrowing " a lawn or ##name ##nt though .
i ' m glad you gave him a chance to shine ! everyone deserves a chance to be trusted , and it ' s good on you to roll the dice !
uh oh , what did you do ?
e ##w , that does sound gross . was it some sort of bet or that ' s all you had ?
aw ##w that ' s awful . do you have to move like for a job or something ?
oh i bet . make sure to hang out with as many people as you can before you leave !
nice , how much was it worth ?
make sure to give your wife a big present when it is her birthday !
oh yu ##ck . maybe it was expired then ?
i hope you threw it out !
oh what movie do you want to see ?
that looks really exciting !
yes , and you didn ' t have to always buy items for the extra value menu .
those are the good old days . have to use coup ##ons these days !
oh that was so close .
maybe you will win next time !
i remember my first city apartment , the lights and sirens . it can be difficult .
i don ' t think they know about mu ##ffle ##rs ! you should try white noise and black out curtains .
je ##ez . was it audible ? smell ##able ?
w ##he ##w , i would be too . god knows if she messed herself .
i would do that to .
yeah , they should never find out .
from your house ? do you have any idea who did it ?
i would be furious , they are expensive now a days !
they must have been quite good .
i hope you have better control next time .
lucky ! last flat i had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere , lo ##l .
my cell was out of range and it was dark out . my daughter was not happy . i am glad you got help .
that ' s very ad ##mir ##able of you . it feels like no one takes care of family anymore .
i am sure with your care , she will be much better off . i wish you and your family well .
oh no is your dog okay ?
i hope it isn ' t anything serious .
hey that ' s sweet ! what for ?
oh ##h yeah ! that sounds awesome ! is it a contest ?
i am very proud of you ! keep it up !
i wish i had your drive .
is it for your work or part of any school projects you are having ?
i admire engineering work . the true pioneers of society ' s good
garbage collection most important
all police not bad
would she mind that ? i wouldn ' t really mind that so much .
we all use a certain brand here . now , if you used my tooth ##brush , that would be fighting actions !
ah that ' s a pity . it really sucks to lose favorite shops .
it ' s like losing a family member . . . i hope you can find another shop like that someday .
what movie is it ?
that looks like a fun movie !
what a way to wake up ! that ' s awful , what happened ?
well , i am sorry you had to witness that . admitted ##ly , it
you utter ##ing this phrase , i remembered the peter griffin me ##me . so tell me , what grind ##s your gears ?
why you guys don ' t you deliver a complain note to the management . they are responsible for handling the office tools
oh no ! why didn ' t you keep it in the attic or something ?
oh i see . i bet it was a sad day then .
is she a good driver ?
i hope she is careful with it .
congratulations , is in an area that you are interested in ?
awesome , i ' m happy for you , good luck !
i am sorry . what happened to the cat ?
i hope you have pet insurance , you never know what can happen .
ha ##ha , i ' m with you . that ' s the worst , it almost ruins the meal .
you could , but it ' s always a gamble !
i am happy for you !
i hope you get married !
ok
ok carry on
that would make me angry , and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru .
i agree . i really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing !
good thing your boss was available . i would not worry about being embarrassed . we ' ve all done something dumb .
if he does then he isn ' t a very good person .
i would be pretty furious as well , those can be expensive to get removed !
i agree , some people just don ' t care about anyone but themselves . it ' s sad .
i ' m good . how about you ?
that sounds quite scary .
oh dear . did they find out about it ?
maybe one day you could repay them ?
that ' s such a great feeling ! congratulations on all the hard work you put in paying off !
then it sounds like you have two things going for you ; an a + and some new found confidence !
that is awesome ! do you think you are prepared ?
well that sounds like you have prepared for sure ! hope all goes well !
yi ##kes ! that ' s scary , what did you do about it ?
good play , i probably would of done the same , ha ##ha .
that is so terrible !
you seem like a very good friend .
that ' s gonna take some time . i love their designs , but i hate the assembly !
that ' s really cool . have fun building the dresser !
oh no ! what had happened ?
on the bright side you can buy a new vase to replace it !
oh what did he make you ?
he sounds like a fun kid !
ah , a plunge ##r didn ' t do the trick ? hope it wasn ' t too expensive !
yeah , well at least it didn ' t break the bank , things happen .
oh that is sad . i hope you can spend some good time together then .
i hope you can also visit her there if you get the chance !
that ' s awesome . i saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill . .
i know . my advice is take it seriously just in case
that ' s so frustrating ! do you know who it is ?
sorry to hear that . maybe you and the other ten ##ets can lobby for additional parking somehow ?
wow , that must have made you feel so good about yourself .
it ' s such a great joy to win something . i hope your luck continues .
that could be kind of scary . have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely ?
well , maybe try meeting some new friends ? someone a little closer , perhaps ?
good for you ! it is really dangerous to do that .
hopefully you can teach your friend to copy your behavior !
was it the meg ?
i can ' t wait to see it now !
that is so messed up .
the world is not fair .
nice . i love don ##uts . are you going to go there as soon as they open ?
i haven ' t had any in a while , but now i suddenly want some !
yes i agree . i love to watch them do their routines on tv .
something about watching the world ' s best really keeps me interested .
wow ! how big was it ? did you smell it ?
yeah , gotta be careful and give them their space
yi ##kes ! that made a mess i bet . did you get burned ?
yeah , and it can stain . i drop my coffee more often than i am willing to admit .
oh my god ! that sounds terrifying
just don ' t get too close ! you never know what can trigger them
me too , i ' m excited for fall , i like to layer my clothes
and the snow ! i ' m excited to start skiing again
i would love to try them .
i really love s ##nick ##er ##do ##odle ##s !
don ' t be so hard on yourself . some people are just natural ##s !
singing is like any other skill . with time and practice , i bet you can really tune those pipes !
you should put some time aside to study .
that ' s a good start , just stay motivated and focus on learning everything you can . you should pass the test easily .
by who ? who are you trying to get noticed by ?
oh that ' s so nice ! i ' m sure you ' re a great cow ##or ##ker and employee
that ' s nice to hear ! have you treated her to something special ?
always stay faithful , it is the best thing for your relationship .
that must have been very humiliating .
i hope that never happens again .
o ##oo ##h , sorry , that must have been embarrassing
take it easy , did you find your way out ?
oh no ! was it a small local place ?
that ' s too bad , small places are usually hidden gems for food
ou ##ch . i actually have done that before too though . . .
it ' s embarrassing in the moment , but i think there are more clumsy people all around us .
je ##ez that sucks
what time is the trip
oh , that is just awful . losing someone is so hard .
was he ill or was it sudden ? either way , it ' s still painful .
that sounds scary . what made you feel unsafe ?
i would have probably felt the same way as you . how did everything turn out ?
awesome ! have you been looking forward to it ?
great ! i hope you have fun and remember it for a long time
i ' m sorry . i hope you find it .
where do you think it can be ?
oh no that sounds frustrating ! i get road rage !
yes ! what ##s even worse is when other people don ' t pay attention in bad traffic !
wow , that is impressive !
i wish your friend could teach my dog a few tricks !
it ' s good to hear ! are you alright now ?
fine . have a joy ##ful life ahead !
a hike in your package ? i ' m sorry , i don ' t follow . as in how long it would take to get there to you ?
oh ##h . . i see ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' ve never had the personal experience of having to do so , but sometimes people really have to argue and advocate for themselves to get the things they feel they ' ve earned and deserved , like a salary raise . i hope in the future you can do that so that you can feel like you ' re getting what you ' ve earned .
that sounds like it would be pretty gross .
definitely , i ' m not a super clean person but that ' s a bit far .
that must be a relief .
i hope you get a fresh start elsewhere !
oh i understand , mine is only 2 1 / 2 right now but i feel that way too when going through his pre ##emi ##e clothes . you probably feel it much more if they are grown though .
yes ! do you keep your favorite things of theirs ? i always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest !
what a beautiful memory tho to have ! yeah a little weird but a little cool too !
ha ha i understand its creepy but then again my mother kept her mothers glass eye ##ball so i guess nothing would surprise me anymore !
oh no ! what kind of exam was it ?
i bet ! what are you going to school for ?
oh , don ' t worry . you ' ll get good response . what was the email about ?
hope ! you ' ll get a good reply !
in his work ? or life ?
give him some time . i ' m in counseling and it ' s taken about a month for it to really help .
that ##s good to hear . being independent all your life and then being cared for all the time can be a hard transition
hopefully this will work out well for everyone involved .
oh i hate when that happens . did you make it on time ?
that sucks . why did you wake up late ?
that sounds so fun . what great friends !
i am sure it was a great time !
losing weight is the best feeling . i did that a couple of summers ago . . it ' s one of those few things where you can visibly see yourself getting better , and there ' s not much that gives you as much pride as that . congratulations !
i was proud of my mom when she started focusing more on her weight , too , just because of what you said - - she ' s getting older . i wish she could live to 150 , so anything that helps her live longer , makes me really happy . good for you for making that choice sooner rather than later .
there is always social security and part time jobs , that seems to be the norm these days . a lot of old people do not have enough saved
i understand and i seriously think finance should be taught in school at a young age but the banks do not want that and will fight to keep that class out of schools
what place did you go to ?
that makes sense , but yeah , human error is a very real thing , which is why self driving cars would probably be an improvement
glad to hear your life took a turn . it ' s always weird , and even sometimes funny , to look back on your life to see where you came from , and how different and sometimes worse things were
well , it ' s always so annoying in the beginning , when you know you have to change , but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change . it ' s hard for people to break things up into smaller pieces so it ' s not so da ##unt ##ing . but congratulations to you for reaching a happier place
wow ! how often do you play the lottery ?
neat ! well that is a fantastic feat . maybe you can win again sometime ?
that is awesome . how was the rest of the show ?
whoa that sounds incredible . you are very lucky to have witnessed that .
did they go away or did you break up ?
well , remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end .
good mom , or dad ?
i hear you : ) my mom is like that . it means you ' re a great nur ##ture ##r .
oh man ! was it poisonous ?
hmm , what state do you live in ? although i am in michigan and we have poisonous ones here too . i didn ' t even realize in mid michigan we did until i almost stepped on one . . i had a panic attack too lo ##l
oh man . . tn has water mo ##cas ##sin ##s i think - be careful !
ah i ' m sorry to hear that . were you really busy today then ?
oh yeah i know it . i have to work remote sometimes and , depending on the mood , loneliness hits hard .
those sound super effective . i wish i had some of them here , i have never seen mosquito ##es as bad as they are this year .
i will have to look into those , they sound like a really good investment .
oh , that ' s disgusting ! have you tried to talk to them about it ?
oh my god ! i would contact your city or dh ##ec . i bet if they started to get fined they would clean it up !
iv ##e wanted to play the switch for so long long , i have heard such good things about it . do you like it ?
i think that is my problem with games , i don ##t have the time
what did you fail at exactly ?
i am sorry to hear that , i hope you are able to succeed eventually !
how long did you let your hair get ?
good , i am glad you like the new change !
what system do you have ?
cool . i have an xbox one x
why did you break up ?
i would say let it go , do not bother with it
me too ! i love fall weather !
i like that it is not too hot and not too cold .
would ' ve been ? i ' m very sorry for you .
that ' s so tragic . i ' m very sorry .
maybe you should see about signing up to some sort of social group ?
yeah but , a lot of them won ' t come back . once they graduate they ' ll move off and start their lives .
sounds like a plan for a day off , i ' d love to do that too .
we all need time to relax and rec ##har ##ge .
aw ##w man . that ##s a silly reason to get pulled over . did you try to talk to the police officer about it ?
you might have better luck when you go to court about it . the judge should be understanding . its a common mistake
oh yeah , that game looks crazy . they have a ridiculous amount of characters this time , it ' s great .
i heard my boy k ro ##ol got in , that really surprised me . i haven ' t seen him around in forever .
that is great , i have never been fishing before
i wil give it a shot some time then !
it ' s amazing . . the rich just think we don ' t have bills and needs right ?
are you moving in too another apartment or a house ?
she sounds like a great mother ! what kind of animals do you have ?
wow you ' re running a vet clinic or something ha ##ha ! well it sounds like they are surrounded with love .
me to i love the weather in fall are you ready for fall because summer is so hot .
yes the colors are so beautiful in the fall and i love the fashion look as well let ' s cheer to fall almost being here lo ##l .
that sounds exciting and a little scary . where are you going ?
i took a trip to europe once . once you get used to riding the rails and traveling around it ' s a blast .
those days are they best . are you going to run er ##rand ##s or just chill ?
that ##s awesome . enjoy it .
i ' m sorry , i ' ve been through that too . were you really close ?
well , i hope you can get through it ok : )
i hope it didn ' t damage your house or anything on your property !
i bet , just take breaks and see if you have any friends that can lend a hand .
what makes you uncomfortable about it ?
ah , that seems reasonable , probably better to take it slowly .
what kind of stuff ?
oh nice , what kind of party ?
man that has to be a rough go .
sometimes they enjoy being able to get around on their own even if it is dangerous .
u ##gh ! what a dun ##ce ! maybe your husband should tell him . have you told him strongly ? like . . stay away from me creep ?
well that would be good for commitment etc . . but not good when someone says no about something like this
are your cats ok or are they sick ?
you must be worried sick ! . i hope everything is ok .
i would ' ve went flying if i heard that ! what was it ?
what a relief . that probably frightened quite a few people too . i ' m glad that the response to it was prompt .
ha ##ha oh boy todd ##lers , they can be a real handful ! my daughter is almost 2 so i understand !
so true , they are very ob ##ser ##vant and watching / learning even when you don ' t realize it .
that ' s unfortunate : ( would it be feasible for you to just sell your car and work with public transportation for a while until you can afford it ?
lo ##l , that might be a bit extreme . maybe selling parts of your body , like plasma ?
why is it sad ?
they do , but sadly that is part of life .
i know right ! what shows did you watch ?
i watched all of those . clarissa explains it all , are you afraid of the dark , cousin sk ##eet ##er . . .
e ##w ##w . i hope he was outside - that stuff stink ##s !
i bet it was . don ' t you just hate those eating contests where people are shoving stuff into their mouths so fast ? !
no . i have to admit canned tuna is not one of my favorites . did you watch this on tv ?
i was the same way about dogs for a long time . did something happen to make you dislike cats ?
that ' s what happened with me and dogs . i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you can find a different animal companion !
which ivy league college ?
that is a great school , what does she teach ?
that sounds really pleasant . what kind of forest was it ?
that sounds pretty sp ##ook ##y . i am glad you made it out alive .
did they do anything like kissing ?
were you being jealous ?
that ' s incredible . how old ?
what great ages !
okay , will it damage anything ?
will coming out with it be as bad as if you were caught ?
have they gotten in fights like that before , and did the police get called ?
yu ##ck , i used to live in a rough area and that kind of thing would happen . it gets really old fast .
that is awesome . i love water parks . do you like pools in general ?
oh yeah ! it is cool here today but it has been insane ##ly hot . pools are the best .
aaa ##h , gross ! i bet it smelled awful !
garbage smell is the worst . it ' s like this specific sweet sick smell found nowhere else in nature .
oh no , do you have a anxiety pill you could take to calm you down ?
bring someone with you that could be emotional support
how terrible ! i ' m so sorry that happened . how long ago was it ?
have you tried to find a counselor ? that might help you to get through it .
whoa . she must be feeling a lot better ?
what a fantastic surprise . hope she keeps progressing .
oh no ! that is such an inc ##on ##ven ##ience .
is it something you can do yourself or does it have to be done at a shop ?
why was you scared was it to dark ?
oh no you should have had someone with you that is pretty scary anything could have been out there .
wow , you sound really confident of that ! i hope you have a backup plan in case you don ' t , but you must be really good at hockey .
well , maybe i ' ll be seeing you on the television one day !
that is good that you want to study more .
what is your major ?
what happened ?
wow ! i bet that was a scary thing to experience ,
oh how exciting !
i bet it will be a great time and fun !
did you say something or show up anyway ?
i guess that ##s true
neat ! what kind of pet does your sister have ?
that is so cool ! what do you feed it ?
uh oh , what has happened to it ?
so what are you planning to do ?
well you have to have a car though .
i ' m sorry you ' re going through this .
i know right . mine started yesterday
they want you to remember their last summer vacation day with you .
i wouldn ##t dare home school . lo ##l
me either . that ; s no preparation for the world
so gross ! i ' ve been there . hopefully not new shoes ?
oh gee ##z ! ! ! was it in your own yard ?
congratulations ! i ' m sure everything will be fine !
i ' m sorry to hear that , i think you have the right positive attitude though .
congratulations what type of work will you be doing ?
you will be awesome glad it is something you are exciting about doing good luck .
oh what is the band ? sometimes cover bands sound better ! lo ##l
lo ##l ! ! that ' s a hysterical name ! never heard of talking heads . what genre ?
sometimes governments can be detrimental rather than helpful . what is the harassment ?
that ' s too bad . we get a lot of gunshot ##s here too and no one comes to help .
that ' s not good ! take them away , start early
no you don ' t have too . little kids can just play with toys and not on video games . it ' s not good for them really .
are you sv ##ain ##g for something particular ?
that ##s so true
i can imagine it was ! wow . did you enjoy yourself tho ?
that would have been so cool ! get one next time if you can . : )
what happened ? sometimes people are just having bad days .
oh , i see . were they making fun of you guys ?
that ##s gross .
ye ##a i wouldn ##t touch that no matter how much they wanted to pay me he ##h
do you normally have to work on weekends ? what did you do ?
sounds like fun glad you got to do enjoy yourself
gaa ##h ! that ' s a state tax bill ? that ' s insane , it ' s hard enough already to open a business .
jesus ! i hate opening my mail already because it ' s bills , i can ' t imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things , and then on top of it being sent stuff like that . ag ##gh ##h ! i hope it ends well for you , though .
i can ' t imagine ! i have a hard time sitting for long hours too . what are you looking in too ?
that ##s a job that is needed for sure . you could also try and get a degree in programming - it usually only takes a year ? so many things you can do . also look into selling online . it ' s a great business if you stay on top of it daily : )
never heard of such a thing . is it outdoors ?
true , is it a fun place too go ?
did they pick it back up ?
maybe they just don ' t notice it .
oh that is cool , did it bring back some memories as well ?
that ##s good
that sucks . are there any cameras in the parking lot ?
some people have no integrity . . . .
oh ? did someone leave it open , or did someone break in ?
oh no ! i hope you find him
how many fingers have they lost ?
now that is impressive
call the po - po .
spray the hose in that direction to get the tv wet .
oh no ! what happened ?
i would have been terrified ! what did you do ?
oh poor thing ! what did you do ?
ya ##y ! i had a little box turtle when i was younger , i liked her a lot . i hope mrs . lee has a long and happy ( and not thirsty : ) ) life with you !
what all do you have to get done ?
what all do you have to get done ?
ph ##ew , that sounds like a lot of work ! you better start getting on that , then !
it is scary yet ex ##hila ##rating lo ##l
some don ' t like them . i can ' t do the ones that go straight down .
oh wow , congratulations ! i ' m guessing you weren ' t expecting ?
i ' m so glad ! when are you due ?
oh yeah why is that ? did the cops drag you out ?
ha ##ha ##h stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped ! i got ##cha
that ##s a big accomplishment .
next thing you know she will be walking .
weekends off are always great . what did you do with your time ?
sounds fun . i hope you had a good time !
that ' s a lot of dedication . was it for a special occasion ? and have you been baking for very long , or do you do it professionally at all ?
oh , i feel terrible for both of you . your hard work lost , and she probably feels really guilty too , for something that was maybe an accident . i hope you guys were able to talk it out and not get too upset with one another after a while .
as long as other ##day ##s you are eating healthy i think its fine to cheat once in awhile
just hit the gym as soon as you can and you will feel better !
who hasn ' t that happened to before ! if it took you that long to notice , i bet no one else noticed . were you able to fix it later ?
yeah , i can understand how you would feel embarrassed there . it sounds like it didn ' t lead to anything too bad though , so maybe most people don ' t remember it happened at this point .
i love the feeling a roller ##co ##aster gives . have you gone before ?
yes the juice is certainly worth the squeeze
good for you ! what are you planning to spend it on ?
enjoy it ! you deserved it : ) i hope you will get more checks like that
that ' s wonderful ! i go to church every sabbath
i agree with you ! i don ' t know what i would do without god .
i am sure he has heard it before !
you were just in the moment , i bet it won ##t happen again
a three pound burger ? ! ? that ' s crazy , i could never eat one of those in one sitting .
wow . i bet that ' s going to hurt him later , though .
did you travel for work or for vacation ?
its too soon to be homes ##ick !
that is awesome . you sound confident .
good for you . good luck . just remember to have a good time and you will be fine .
that ' s too bad . do you mo ##w a lot ?
absolutely . there are things far more important than lawn length .
and how does that make you feel ?
what is she going to school for ?
well what are some things that are bad from him
oh ##h i mean maybe you can go and give it a try and see how he does
your company left you alone ? in what way ? that does sound like a tr ##ou ##bling situation .
oh , i see . that makes a little more sense . did everything work out , or are they still gone ?
what is your character ?
cool , well have a good time the ##if ##ing !
i just love fall ! i ' m guessing that ' s your favorite season ?
i feel you . watching the leaves change colors makes me feel peaceful .
aw ##h that does sweet of you , what kind of pet is it ?
iv ##e always wanted one of those but to be honest i would be afraid lo ##l
where were they
oh that was nice
i know how you feel i can be lonely sometimes .
i recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups . it takes time to find a new set of friends .
oh no ! i ' m so sorry to hear that !
hopefully something similar will come up soon . maybe you can check for another position in the company you ' re hoping for !
did you get it dismissed ?
that ##s the law !
maybe he was upset with you .
then you ' d get in lots of trouble as most places have laws that your dog can ' t be on the loose
whoa what a great surprise . congratulations .
i am sure you deserve it . that is fantastic .
long trip . how can you afford it ?
okay , i get it . ever seen the movie " hostel " ?
are you alright ?
is it physical ? if you need anything let me know .
does it work for good luck ?
i understand . is it a very nice watch ?
did you make it ?
sounds like the start of a business
that ' s wonderful . always nice to take some time for the self , especially with pt ##o .
make sure to enjoy it to the full ##est .
yi ##kes . did you ever find the spider ?
i think its time to invest in a can of bug spray
if you kn ##o
leaving family at home ?
behave on your vacation : )
that ' s so awesome ! what a huge relief that must be .
keep focused ! you can do it ! being debt free is an amazing feeling !
good memories ?
that ##s always good
did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldn ##t go do ?
well hopefully you can go soon
what do you do ?
that sounds interesting
what is going on next week ?
that is awesome . kids here start tomorrow so i know the feeling of being ready for them to go !
i wouldn ' t want to do that .
it ' s just not worth it .
why is that
i agree with you there .
how nice of him ! ! you should be thankful to him ! !
now how nice of you ! ! that ##s what are friends for . i hope you will get a job and your friend will get a gift ! !
very nice . i am sure you deserve it .
good for you . buy yourself something special .
i am sure it is a bitter ##sw ##eet moment . i can relate myself . it takes some getting used to
you will still have plenty of time before your son becomes an un ##ru ##ly teenager . cher ##ish it .
oh yeah that ' s couldn ' t have been good !
most definitely ! would you say you live in a good neighborhood ?
hey it ' s a win win ! you get the nice points and she gets her lunch !
i bet she loves you for it either way ! it doesn ' t matter how little the effort was , it matters if it was nice !
i ' ll bet it was ! that must have been an enormous burger !
ha ##ha ! i ' d need a lot more than a free ts ##hir ##t to eat a 3 pound burger !
did you beat her down ?
im sure it will make you feel better .
i was late to an appointment recently because i got stuck in a traffic jam .
that ' s so annoying . maybe you should leave earlier next time
what kind of prank did he pull on you ?
well , what kind of prank was it ?
how soon after did the beat ##down come ?
that ##s what im talking about !
did you talk to your boss ?
that ' s awful , what did you want to do ?
that ' s such a shame . could you perhaps join them for a couple of days ?
yeah . oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that ! so sorry you ' re going to miss time with your family . hopefully they ' ll take lots of photos !
what ended up happening ?
oh well good luck
oh no , did they leave a note ?
what a jerk , i ' m sorry that happened .
that sounds pretty awesome . how long until you get off from work ?
ha ##ha ##ha hope you have fun !
did someone give you a recipe or did you google it ? keep tasting it until you get what you want !
as long as it has good reviews , make sure you put a little squeeze of lime in it at the end . it really brings out the flavor . right before you serve it tho .
i love ram ##en ! not the health ##iest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot
my mom doesn ' t lo ##l but she is crazy about healthy vegetarian food , so : )
exciting , is it hazardous scary or more excited scary ?
well , go in with an open mind and maybe your experience will be different . and be sure you pay attention to the safety requirement !
chemicals mean serious business , but you landed the job . good luck with doing well .
ah ##hh i bet your nerves are thru the roof . when ##s the test date ?
i wish you a lot of luck , and try not to let it get the best of you ( way easy to say . . . way hard to actually do . i know )
have you asked the merchant why it is late ?
i would be too ! they should be more dil ##igen ##t with their shipping estimates !
what field are you in ?
that is awesome , i hope it goes well
did you ever get cheated on ?
well that is good for you then !
is fall your favorite season ?
summer is my favorite because it means vacation !
did you stop to help him ?
we ' ve all been there . . . at least i have .
oh wow , is he flirting with her ? does he know she is a relationship with you ?
i would def ##eni ##tly just have her block the number , so he gets the message .
nice ! what will you be doing ?
nothing to be nervous about , i ' m sure you ' ll do fine !
i know i am really exited , what do you have planned ?
that is what i love the most about thanksgiving the food is always the best
that is so awesome , have you been accepted yet /
i hope you do too ! applying is a huge step in the right direction !
any damage to where you live ?
i hope you can get it all cleaned up without too much trouble .
probably once or twice in my life , but i don ##t go anywhere alone so . . . : /
that is really crap ##py , i think whatever makes you feel that way you should try to figure it out and battle it ! you deserve to be happy all the time .
that would be annoying .
that would be bother ##some , especially if it ' s taking away from your time .
that is always fun to do . what did you get yourself ?
that is very cool . i like tech that is practical but also fun to use .
do you know what their names will be ?
have you had any kids yet ?
oh that ' s wonderful twins seem really cool .
cong ##rat ##s , i ' ve heard that many twins have a special bond so i hope they have that and do well .
yi ##kes , were you able to clean it up ?
that sounds like it would do the trick . hopefully his couch is okay .
what did you guys eat ?
lo ##l , did you tell your friend about the hair ?
what contest is that ?
i hope you win !
congratulations ! that ' s a very good job . what kind of food do you prepare ?
well they must think a lot of your abilities to promote you like that . i love mexican food , bt ##w : )
i love it when managers actually pay attention . makes the job so much easier and more pleasant . good for you .
no , it wasn ' t you , obviously . your previous manager sounds like a control freak !
how long has it been since you have gotten a raise ?
did you talk to your manager ?
not worth the risk is it ?
okay , you know you can buy them too . and somebody lost for your gain .
oh no ! is he / she okay ?
blood makes me freak out too . that is pretty scary ! i ' m glad they are okay .
seriously ? what was going on ?
oh that ' s awful . i am glad you and your stuff is okay though !
that is such an exciting time and really nice of everyone to do that .
that also helps relieve some stress off of you trying to get everything ready by yourselves .
that sounds nice , how long has it been
it will feel like old times for sure
wow , great ! you must be so proud !
of course , that is fantastic ! cong ##rat ##u ; e him from me .
congratulations ! you must be very proud of her . what kind of recital was it ?
i bet ! it takes quite a level of talent and composure to perform publicly like that . ku ##dos to your daughter !
could you call people ?
yes meet new people !
that is lucky do you talk much in class ?
well you probably should start paying much at ##tet ##ion if you don ##t want to risk it
its good that you like it so much . why are you worried that it will close ?
oh , i understand . maybe they make up for it on busy days , like weekends . i hope they stay open so you can continue to enjoy their food .
oh no , did anyone see
that ##s unfortunate , i am sure they will forget
i ' m so sorry to hear that . were you able to be there when she passed ?
sometimes you don ' t know when they ' ll pass unfortunately . i hope you take some time to gr ##ive .
how was the service ?
did you put any money in the collection pot ?
did you dig it out of the trash ?
did you cry yourself to sleep that night ?
that ' s a great surprise !
that ' s really nice . i hope it was a big raise !
im sorry to hear that ? is it a bad cold ?
that ' s good to hear . but kids can be a handful when they are sick .
i bet that ' s super awesome ! is it really comfortable ?
oh man , i would fall asleep in that
that is never a good feeling
do you have some bills that you can put off until later ?
will you go again ?
i can understand that for sure .
sounds like a fun thing to do . what kind of racing did you see ?
oh , i ' ve never seen that . it sounds amazing ! if they ' re anything like the f1 drivers they ' ll be incredible !
yes ! i love halloween . i need to start making plans myself .
that ' s awesome , i hope he enjoys it too !
that was really nice of them ! i ' m glad you got some help
amazing ! that had to be really stress ##ful too though
that is not good , do you have any idea why you spaced out
don ##t worry about it it happens to everyone it is nothing to be ashamed of
are you one of the uber drivers ?
did they apologize to you ?
that ' s a special moment . to hopefully see your kids doing better than you and all that jazz . i ' m in college but my parents live only a couple hours away , so i just visit them instead , since them coming to me wouldn ##t be anything too special . but congratulations to you and your kid
that ' s awesome that he is helping to break the mold then . says just as much about him as it does about you , though . takes good parenting to get him to that level of motivation
it ' s great to hear that you ' re in such good shape ! i need to work on that myself .
yeah , i wasn ' t careful about what i ate when i was younger , and i ' m really paying for it now . hopefully they can get back in shape too .
that is a nice way to remember him . its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive .
i ' m sure that ' s an awesome feeling .
yeah , don ' t be too hard on yourself for that . we ' re supposed to like that stuff .
i see . you ' ll find balance along the way though .
i used to be that way , because i love holidays and the mood it puts everyone in . but i ' m starting to hate how short the fall and winter days are , and how quickly it gets dark . now that i ' ve been exercising outside more lately , i hate losing that time in the sun
i can understand that . and i live in the south , so it doesn ' t get that cold , so i can ' t really complain . i visited my girlfriend who lives in the midwest last winter , and it got under 0 at times . i could not live like that long term .
that must have been painful and a little embarrassing !
probably they just fell bad for you , thank god it was not worse .
yi ##kes . i live in the south and we don ' t get those . just palm ##etto bugs ( flying roach ##es ) . i think i ' d rather have those than rats , personally .
my girlfriend has complained about rats too , since she lives in the midwest . says she ' ll be taking out the trash and she ' ll hear them sc ##ur ##ry ##ing and it will freak her out . good luck to you guys who have to deal with the little disease - in ##fest ##ed things . .
i ' m so proud of you ! that ' s a lot to deal with all at once !
it ' s worth it ! it ' ll teach you a lot that you ' ll use later in life
that ' s very sad . my grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it . i ' m told that doing puzzles etc . keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it .
i really feel for you . it ' s not easy , i won ' t kid you . but at least you understand what ' s happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable .
i hear you there , it can be more relaxing spending time at home than ##g going to a he ##ctic party .
will your friend be disappointed with you ?
i would be so excited ! i ' m so proud of you !
hopefully you have some wine to celebrate with !
that ' s annoying . maybe you should try giving them a call again ?
i completely understand , i hope they will call you soon so you won ' t have to
oh . do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy ?
i understand . you know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person .
yeah , i have tried it a few times . it suggests some pretty cool things too .
oh wow ! that usually doesn ' t happy , usually that feeling fades with time .
it sounds like you have a keep of a place to go !
wow that ' s awesome . you must be feeling pretty content .
you did things right . you will be able to retire one day on your current track .
that ' s pretty cool to hear . when i have kids , i hope they ' re the same , and can get into sports , since it offers so much . good for you for getting them into sports
it ' d be cool if she made it to the stage where she could play the world cup . . i feel like that ' s such a cool sporting event , and if you had your child in that , that ' d create some kind of family legacy .
did you bring it in and take care of it ?
that ' s very kind of you . too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives .
did the neighbors come after you ?
maybe or at least recovered your basketball !
tell him you had to go to the store !
how nice ! are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in ?
that ##s great . i hope you both enjoy yourselves .
congratulations ! i am sure you are very happy and bee ##ming with pride right now . what ##s the next step for her ?
excellent ! any scholarships in the future ?
how scary ! i hope your neighbors are ok .
that is great , at least there was something positive !
awesome , what kind of restaurant is it ?
i love thai food , i can see why it made you feel good !
oh wow a wonderful surprise indeed !
yes it ' s always good to have family !
that ' s really cool . did it bring back good memories ?
i ' m very sorry for your loss . i ' m glad you have the letter from him though .
i guarantee you know more than you think ! just be method ##ical and you ' ll do just fine .
everyone needs a math genius friend , lo ##l . at least , you do if you ' re as hopeless at math as i am !
oh im so sorry you felt this way ! i hope your mood will get better . maybe watch a good comedy ?
i understand how you feel though . i would feel lonely but i would definitely do something fun like play video games or watch movie
that ' s terrible . . there ' s nothing more frustrating and def ##lating in life than unexpected expenses . i hope you ' re able to cover all of it . i know if i had one right now , i might not be able to manage it .
i hope you can . if you think there ' s even a chance , then give it a shot , if it will save you that much money . my brother watches youtube videos all the time of how to fix random things , and it seems to work for him . if you ' re the type of person that can learn that way , and if you have the patience , then i think it ' s a good thing to try .
what was she so negative ?
what kind of dog is it ?
oh that ' s terrible , getting delayed always ann ##oys me
oh yes that sounds a little dangerous i wouldn ' t take that flight unless it was necessary .
that sounds so nice ! i love to be with my dog outside too , even if just watching him play .
yes ! v and a good exercise too !
that ' s great , what did you have for lunch ? i had some hot dogs and baked beans
i love chicken alfredo ! so delicious . i wish i could nap too lo ##l i ' m a mom , mom ##s don ' t nap
how did you like it ? did it give an energy boost ?
wow , so it definitely made a difference . i bet you will be drinking more then .
you know there is one thing that might make it even better .
ye ##a , but have you ever experienced wings before ?
i wish i could go to my old high school . i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit
i bet ! high school was fun . we couldn ' t wait to become adults lo ##l
e ##w ##w ##w . i hate it when dog owners don ' t pick up after their pets . we always carried a po ##op bag with us for when our po ##och " went " .
no , they ' re not , and it ' s not just in this country . europe is terrible for dog po ##o in the streets !
that ##s amazing ! he must really really love you .
well at ##lea ##st he did what he could to show you he cares .
that ' s pretty gross . were there other people around ? i ' m always more nervous about that when people are around .
that sounds ho ##rri ##fying . pretty sure i would die .
ha ##ha oh no . sometimes you need a cheat day .
maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking . that way you aren ##t hungry .
it ' s good to be confident . i am sure you will get some good news soon .
you did great . just wait and don ' t stress about it .
wow ! was your order important ? have you called the post office to find out what happened ?
well that ' s good . i hope her makes it before the end of the day and you get your package .
awe ! hopefully they were cute pictures
growing up sucks ! l ##ma ##o
congratulations ! it ' s not easy moving to a new place , but it ' s great fun getting to know your new home !
that takes a lot of courage . i ' m proud of you ! i moved last year and it ' s both fun and scary at the same time
did you wind up eating it ?
lo ##l , you are such a nice person . i would have def ##inate ##ly kicked that guy out !
happy early birthday ! do you have any plans ?
that ' s a great plan . i hope your wife makes it happen !
that is terrifying , did you get away from it ?
that is good , who knows if the dog has ra ##bies or not . it would be unpleasant to get bit !
have you been expecting it long ?
oh no ! ! i hope it comes soon . i know how that it to be waiting for money to come .
you don ##t like to gossip at all ?
i under ##stad ##n that , others business is a very sensitive subject
is this brother of your ' s a lot younger than you are ?
would you say your relationship is like the one in that movie , brother bear ?
what what , tell me ?
what were some of your favorites ?
you must miss her . but i ' m sure she ' ll be back before you know it !
she must like to travel . have you ever gone with her ?
well that ##s disappointing . maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch .
i know what you mean . it seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled .
did you flip the bird ? some people are so rude .
you should also post the license plate on social media . sometimes public sham ##ing does wonders .
well it ' s a teacher ' s goal to make sure his or her students succeed . she wants you to do your best .
it ' s always good when you have a teacher who cares and puts forth the effort to help you as much as possible .
must feel good to get it over with . how do you think you did ?
that is great . you must have been very confident up there .
yes ! i bet it will , did you go in and kill it ?
what is the job , will you like it ?
that ##s amazing , i have actually had that happen to be before in my life , i was so happy
that ##s right , ta ##ht makes me so happy to know
what did you fail ?
how many times have you tried ?
i almost feel like homework is counter productive . shouldn ' t the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours ?
i guess you ' re right . education isn ' t something that can be rushed ! but still , i think homework is a little excessive .
i ' m sure there ' ll be other games it will be useful for .
i built my own too a few years ago .
at times , though i don ' t have as much time anymore .
that ' s a shame , do you have anything else lined up ?
there ' ll probably be something else
is that a bad thing ?
that ' s good
oh that ci ##nna ##bon smell can be so en ##tic ##ing !
that sounds so good . i haven ' t had one in forever .
oh man ! i would be so excited ! when do you go ?
man that ' s going to be so awesome !
talk crap get smacked
is this a true story
mcdonald ##s is honestly gross to me though , rich or poor . i don ##t eat it .
that ##nk ##s , just a matter of preference i guess .
oh my god , that ##s it so gross , cat pee is the worst .
im so sorry , that ##s why im not the biggest fan of animals .
that sounds like quite a ride . are you a fan of roller ##co ##aster ##s in general ?
i understand that . i hate roller ##co ##aster ##s too .
that is great to hear . anything new going on ?
i wish i were so content . must be a nice feeling .
did it do much damage to your car ?
well , i hope they had insurance at least .
dan ##g , that really blows . what was it made of , glass ?
they should use metal . that never breaks . sorry that happened to you .
did you get up to go check to see what it was ?
that ##s abs ##ou ##lty terrifying to be honest .
how long did it take ?
doesn ' t sound too bad
that ' s awesome . what band is it ?
never heard of it . i hope it was a good show !
it ' s hard for kids to do that . maybe he was just bored ?
it ' s hard for kids to do that . maybe he was just bored ?
that ##s a nice feeling to have job security . do you enjoy your work ?
well sometimes you have to leave comfort behind and take a chance doing something you like .
that sounds so good !
oh no , i bet she ends up loving it ! best of luck !
oh nice ! what kind of phone did you get ?
think of all the mind ##less brows ##ing you can do now !
oh , now that ' s exciting ! do you have any plans to do it ? celebrating with anyone ?
that ' s wonderful ! i ' m happy for you . hopefully he got you something meaningful , sentimental , and long - lasting so that you can keep on enjoying it !
honestly that will end up being a lot better in the long run anyway , won ' t it ? more memorable to know he really spent time and effort getting something for you .
oh man , sorry to hear that . i mean good for your friend but i feel you . i never win anything
maybe one day we will win really big ! who knows
a backed old man ?
ha ##ha ##ha yeah , that kinda sucks
that ' s really cool . what is your idea ?
that sounds like a really cool idea . i hope that it turns out well !
that is really kind of you , many people would not bother . i hope that she wins her battle .
chemotherapy and radiation can really take their toll . there is a program through the cancer society that does a day of beauty with cancer patients . they give them a make ##over , gift ##bags , wig ##s if needed .
that is excellent , and you are a truly giving person . i wish her the best .
why ' s that ?
i ' d imagine it feels pretty nos ##tal ##gic
oh no ! if it helps they probably don ' t remember . that stuff filters out faster than you would think !
well , i feel for ya ! i ' m a very clumsy person myself , trip all the time .
im sure they understand . that is a tough position to be in .
maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them . im sure they would love to hear from you .
did he hurt the baby ? most of the time they are just curious
yeah , that ' s what they do . ha ##ha ##ha
aw ##w , did you take it home with you ? it ' s great to adopt stray ##s .
then i am sure the cat is yours . enjoy your ball of fur !
i totally understand that feeling . it ' s very frustrating . all you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect .
i think we all have our good days and bad days . just keeping plug ##ging along and i bet it gets better soon . it recently did for me .
that sucks .
i know how you feel . keep your head up . start putting out more app ##lica ##ito ##ns .
oh that is the best . did you buy anything ?
perfect . must have been a nice surprise .
do it ! she may say yes !
good ! the sooner the better ! '
wow , that ##s really lucky of you . its good to find nice people out there
good thing you found that guy and not someone else
was it good ?
cool ! there isn ' t anything like that around where i live
about what ?
how did it go ? s [ ee ##ches can be intimidating
wee ##l that ##s good
that ' s great you have such great friends !
well he checks all of the boxes doesn ' t he !
oh man that ' s a bum ##mer . did you leave her or are you giving her another shot
dan ##g that ' s harsh ho ##mie . . . so sorry to hear that bud . don ' t worry as much as it hurts now she did you the favor of kicking herself out of your life . . . you deserve better than her
a rat ! i would have died
you should get traps . you may have scared it away . i think only mice get scared though . rats are like dinosaur mice
that is nice of you . i hope he appreciated it .
well i am sure he will appreciate the effort even if it doesn ' t come out great . you are being thoughtful .
that ' s sad . what happened ?
that ' s so bad . i don ' t have any pets
oh i love vacation ##s ! do you love the water ?
it ' s beautiful i ' m sure you ' ll have tons of fun .
you must be very proud . that is awesome .
hopefully he keeps up . im sure he has a great attitude .
that ' s wonderful !
that shows how lucky you can be !
oh no ! i hope that you were able to get someone to fix it !
probably a good idea !
oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that . my cat is getting old , she ' s 15 . i ' m scared she ' ll pass soon too
that ' s so sad . i hope you feel better soon . i would be so devastated too .
sometimes it can be difficult to get your footing when starting out . it sounds like you enjoy your life now and have something to be proud of .
that is all that people can expect of you , that you try to be the best you possible , each and every day .
that ' s . . . exciting . .
wow that ' s awesome .
that really sucks , i ' ve had that happen to me as well .
i agree , most don ' t bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors .
that really stink ##s . maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that !
what do you think you are really good ?
cool ! did you go to greece for vacation ?
sounds awesome , i ' ve never been to europe
that ' s awesome . i hope that it goes well !
do you feel confident in you did on your finals ?
i am so happy for you . doe she make you feel special ?
that is awesome . everyone wishes to find someone like that .
what did he do to inspire such pride
nice . that is pretty awesome
wow that ##s really impressive . well i need to be open . flow to me money , flow to me . . .
$ 1 billion come to me . im ready to rec ##ie ##ve you
oh that sounds great , i hope you get it !
so exciting ! are you happy to move to a new job ?
maybe she will let you borrow it . or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you .
that ' s way too expensive for a bag . what is it made of , gold ? ha ##ha .
you got an awesome girlfriend . who are you going to see ?
she sure surprised you . i hope you have a great time at the concert .
whoa that is out there . takes some real confidence to rock that .
ye ##a that is true . i hate that .
i know the feeling too . i ' m a 1000 miles from my family .
yeah same to you . i ' m counting down the days until i get to see them again .
in 57 days according to my co ##ut ##down !
oh my goodness . that is crazy . i ' ve never had anything like that happen .
that ' s amazing . what are you going to do with your amazing gift ?
oh yeah ? how did that go ?
yep that happens lots of times but , i don ' t think we ' re supposed to talk about the elephant in the room per the instructions . .
that sucks . did they give a reason ?
well maybe you can complain and get some money back or something ?
yi ##kes , you gotta pay more attention to your textbook maybe
i hope you do well and pass the exam !
that ' s too bad . maybe you can call them ?
i hear you . just think in the old days you would have to write letters , lo ##l .
yi ##kes , that ' s really cruel of him to do that . i ' m sure you ' re trying the best you can
don ' t mind them , everyone has a tough time every ##now and then . you ' ll be okay
wow , that is nice . what does he understand ?
that is cool .
who left all the dirty dishes ?
does she have a job ?
good for you , have a beer for me !
dan ##g , i ' m seriously about to go get one now you made me jealous . not even lying .
it ' s always good when a friend meets his potential
you got to stay focused and make that money . don ' t want the world to pass you by
oh my goodness that is horrible . how come it didn ' t recognize you ?
aw ##w ##w that is so sad . i hope it recognizes you after some time together .
what ' s wrong ? what are you visiting the doctor for ?
yes , definitely get a blood test so you know what you need to watch out for
oh no ! before he got to have it ?
oh ok , that ##s not as bad . i thought it was before he got a chance to blow out the candles
why , did someone cancel on you ?
oh , well it ' ll come in soon enough , you can look forward to it next weekend
what was high school like for you ?
oh , that ' s awful . i ' m really sorry . so do the songs bring back bad memories ?
that ' s great ! how far along is she ?
ha ##ha ##ha , sounds like a great time , you should prepare some games to play at the party
that is in ##fur ##iating . i don ##t see how some people are so unaware .
i feel you . some people just suck .
oh nice . any big plans for it ?
that ' s awesome . the beach is always a good time , especially when the weather is nice !
that ' s sad , how old was your pet izzy
all i ##gua ##na ' s go to heaven so i ' m sure he is
well that ' s quite the accomplishment ! how did you train her ?
ah ##a of course , the oldest opera ##nt conditioning trick in the book . i love it !
sorry to hear that . you get it fixed already or what
it ' s good to have reliable friends .
awesome . sounds like you are def ##int ##ely on top of the world today !
what kind of money we talking ? lottery money ?
oh my ! i hope that it goes well !
i ' m sure it will be ok . it ' s probably nothing .
oh how exciting . what grade was it from ?
that is so sweet . it would be fun if you have children so you can share it with them .
what is the longest you have been apart ?
ye ##a that will be a little lonely for sure . just try and stay productive as much as possible .
wow , that must be exciting . do you have everything prepared ?
nice ! make sure to take lots of photos and make some cool memories together !
whoa , that is quite the confession . but you know , it ' s good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior . very mature . not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves , and you should feel proud about that !
i know , and i know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt . you want to solve the problem though , and that ' s still worth something . being able to take the little victories will go a long way toward the goal you want in terms of how you treat your husband .
i ' ve always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them
it ' s good you ' ve grown and learned . never stop
oh that is awful . i have been fired before it is just the worst . have things gotten better since then ?
it def ##int ##iel ##y sounds bad .
that is good . is it your manager who did the review ?
i understand .
i hate when that happens . my dreams are always so vivid they feel real .
oh my word . that is like a nightmare not a bad dream .
i ' m so sorry you had to go thru that .
oh no i hope everything goes well !
well i hope that it all goes your way !
do you live on a farm ? it will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens .
what are you going to do with the chickens ?
do you do it out of necessity or because of the thrill of it ?
how about you get some of the same food for yourself ?
why is that ?
i don ' t think that being boss ##y . you are just really concerned with getting a job done efficiently
what games did you liked ?
i like a lot cod . it is one of my favorites .
just wear cologne , dress sharp , use mouth ##wash , and let her do all the talking . and you ' ll be just fine
that ' s good . just stay away from the beans and spicy food ha ##ha
that sounds awesome ! i wish i could go !
that sounds like a really good time . it will be like you are a kid again !
aw i am sorry to hear that . i ' m sure he was a good pet .
oh wow . pets can be just like family members . it ' s hard to lose them i know .
why ? what are you worried about ?
just try to relax and not worry so much . yes something bad could happen but there ' s also a chance nothing goes wrong . having anxiety about something can be hard to overcome but you can do it : )
i loved playing that ! they look so outdated now . good times !
that must have been the most epic christmas ever ! i think someone gave us ours but i can ' t remember . makes me want to play now !
whoa cong ##rat ##s . you must be very excited .
that is so awesome . im sure it will be a very fun day to share with everyone .
oh my goodness that is ho ##rri ##d . i ' d think with hot water and de ##gre ##ase ##r .
ha ##ha . you are very we ##ls ##ome . that ' s what happens after years of dirty microwave cleaning .
oh wow where are they ?
why are they in a place so far away from you ? are you away at college ?
oh no ! i ' m so sorry are you going to be alright ?
oh god i ' m so sorry for you ! i hope everything goes well
i would be afraid one of them would get out !
have you held any of your friend ' s spiders ?
that sounds like it could be a great success . do you both work well together ?
i hope its a major triumph for you both !
nice how old are they
nice you seem pretty open minded about so i ' m sure you ' ll handle yourself well .
oh , that ##s em ##bara ##ssing . i hate it when that happens .
ha ##ha , well maybe they didn ' t want to em ##bara ##ss you .
e ##w , yeah it is not worth risking getting food poisoning !
yes , need to check those sell by dates . meat may only be good for a few days afterwards .
oh no ! have you already had some tests or is this the first time ?
i ' m so sorry to hear . what is the problem ?
ah ok , yeah my partner has had similar issues recently . i really hope it all works out for you !
that is so exciting , how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not ?
i am sure you have worked very hard to get to this place !
that is great news ! i am sure he feels a great deal of acc ##omp ##lism ##ent
i hope he enjoys his new job and can celebrate
that sounds so annoying !
i hope they finish up soon . that could drive someone crazy going on for so long .
really ? how come ?
that is very disappointing . maybe next time text or talk on the phone a little bit to see if you will have something in common .
how old are you ?
ah ok , it is fine
oh no ! what do you think had happened or triggered it ?
hope she recover ##s and feels better overall soon . that can be quite the scare !
they are really impressive . what circus was it ?
have you ever gotten to go to a ci ##r ##que du sol ##iel ? if you like ac ##ro ##bat ##s you would love that !
did you call the police ?
i suggest a night owl surveillance system .
that ' s the worst . i have that happen all the time but with onions . its the only thing they have to do so get it right !
did you have them get you a new one plus give you your money back for having to taste that nas ##tine ##ss ?
why would you be worried ? do you have three arms ?
sounds to me like you need to build your self - confidence a bit more .
how come . is their something wrong with it ?
oh my goodness . is that not covered by the water company since it ' s technically their meter ?
i hope they come back with the desired result . good luck
nice do you mind sharing what it was . . . my mom had a cy ##st in her o ##var ##ies but it ended up being benign
oh i feel you ! i have full control over my schedule , it is so nice !
part time self employed and part time just employed by a company . the company lets me choose my shifts though so . . . still full control .
oh wow , that does suck ! hopefully you can push it to another day this week .
def ##eni ##tly , and employers can be unreasonable sometimes .
that ##s awesome what kind of car is it .
have you always wanted a jeep they seem pretty fun to drive .
did the entire class laugh at you ?
i haven ' t pee ##d my pants ever . guess i am just lucky .
why did your dog do it .
my japanese spit ##z did that once . . . lady was waving a bone around and pulling back . . . til he caught her with one snap and almost bit her finger clean off
you must be a little jealous . maybe its time to save up for your own dream car ?
i mean pro ' s and con ' s . . . right ?
oh no ! that is disappointing . did you have to run out and get more ?
well , i guess one night without beer is not going to kill you .
oh boy i hope you get some sleep tonight !
you got it bro !
did you know all the answers ? i wouldn ' t be too good at it .
wow , impressive ! i ' d have to get some category like kids or nutrition to know much of anything . ha ha
that is awful , those movies are pretty good minus the george cl ##oon ##ey and ben af ##fl ##ack films .
you need to go see them and overcome your fear of bats
i ' m sorry to hear that , hopefully you qualify for unemployment while you get back on your feet .
are you in a right to work state ? here in my state they don ' t have to have a reason .
oh no ! i have the same problem at my work ! how do you deal with it ?
yeah it can be hard . i resort ##ed to wearing noise cancel ##ling head ##phones myself !
i ' m sure it ' ll go fine ! are you doing okay ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope the doctor can give you some treatment options .
now that ' s quite a gift ! are you going to take her to any games as a thank you ?
i ' ve been looking forward to it starting too . not a lot going on at the moment . but that ' s wonderful to hear !
what happens next .
well i guess it worked itself out .
i under ##san ##d . do you want to st ##rangle me ?
good .
how come ?
that does sound scary . i would have used my phone flashlight
brought back some old memories ?
that ##s nice
that was nice of you to help them . what did you do to help ?
wow , that sounds really complicated . i could never do that . id send you a thank you card too
what talents do you speak of ?
that ' s pretty cool . do you go to the circus often ?
that ' s amazing to hear . there is nothing like a great relationship !
bad ones def ##ina ##tley make the good one a treasure . have you been together long ?
that is a good long time ! i am sure you have many more ahead of you !
when you appreciate something that much it ' s sure to continue that way ! i ' ve been married 19 years and love almost every minute !
ah , that ' s unfortunate . that can be really tough to remember sometimes . i know because i ' ve forgotten that too . but you ' ll make it up as soon as you can , i ' m sure !
as long as it ' s not too del ##in ##quent , and you have an otherwise good history of on - time payments , you should be okay ! try talking to your loan service ##r , too . they can help .
did they leave a note or anything ? i would be really upset too . were there any cameras that could have seen who did it ?
that ##s the worst . i would feel so awful if i left a dent and flee ##d the scene of the crime . hopefully the guilt is eating away at that person .
i ' m sorry to hear that .
i will try my best .
well that ' s . . . kinda funny not gonna lie
ha ##ha well hey it happens to the best of us . . . i do it around my friends all the time
that is awesome . you must be very excited .
i bet . it will be great to have some time to un ##wind and not think about it .
what makes you unsure ?
you should do a test drive and apply some math to the pay difference to decide if its worth it .
how fun ! what kind of pet is it ?
my kids want one of those , but we have to wait until the youngest is old enough . so cute !
aw ##w ! i bet that is so exciting ! do you want a girl or boy ?
i hope it goes well . children are great .
i am glad you grew out of your shell .
i was really neither .
dan ##g nice ! bug ##att ##is are freak ##in slick , definitely a dream car . . . what does your friend do
well that makes sense . and i ' m sure you can do the same in good time , just stay hungry and be about your paper !
i ' m sorry to hear that ! it sounds like an honest mistake .
oh wow , def ##eni ##tly sounds like he was too focused on video games . maybe talk to him about how it made you feel so you don ' t get res ##ent ##ful .
uh oh , were you alone ? hopefully you didn ' t have to go very far ! that can be super scary for sure .
well that ' s just the worst . at least you ' re okay now ! i don ' t know how you managed it .
nice did you prepare well for it
awesome good luck
really ? why is that ?
oh man that ' s rough . . . maybe you should think about moving ?
i would have been so embarrassed ! hopefully you didn ' t get hurt at all
could have been worse !
what did you do
did someone help you ?
i hate working on the weekend . do you have to work this weekend
oh nice . that ##ll be fun .
oh my god that is so scary . what did you do ?
that is awesome at least you didn ' t get hurt . that ' s what is important
that is annoying . did you told your manager about it ?
why she doesn ' t want to do anything about it ?
oh my god . i am so sorry . i have two sisters and know that pain .
that is horrible . i hope that your family can really cope thru this difficult time .
that is good , i am sure your boss loves that .
you should talk to her about that .
ha ##ha ##ha , i don ##t mean to laugh but i ' m assuming he is young and kids are pretty funny . did anyone else see it happen ?
i ' m sure the other people thought kids will be kids . he ' ll learn eventually !
now that ' s just not right ! weekends are supposed to be for relaxing and hanging out with friends , not sl ##avi ##ng away for the man ! hopefully you didn ' t have to cancel any plans . . .
wow , that really sucks , i ' m sorry to hear that . you deserve to take yourself some vacation time or sick time or something .
you can do it , you just need to start right away
just putting away a little still helps
i always feel like i ' m on top of the world after i workout .
i must agree . even when i get spaghetti legs i must say it ' s worth the rush that comes with it .
what project is that
oh that sounds interesting
wow . is he doing this for a show or a competition ?
terrible . so he is making himself un ##hea ##lth ##y for a t shirt .
what kind would you get
oh cute . i have one . she is the nice ##st dog
did you discipline her ?
yeah that is always gross
why what happened
hopefully it works out for you
why is that ?
lo ##l ! ah - well cher ##ish them while you can in the summers even though it can be ti ##ring : )
well that ' s pretty annoying . aren ' t they supposed to have people there who do that for you ?
if that happens again , you should tell them they should have to pay you the appropriate wage to do work that they ' re supposed to be doing themselves . that ' s insane !
sorry to hear that . what happens during your nightmare ?
well i hope you can find some peace from those dreams .
great to have a daughter in basketball !
fantastic !
did you enjoy it ?
well , maybe you won ' t do it again .
that is good , do you like to drink ?
do you plan to quit forever ?
why ?
me too , sometime , i had the same feeling about someone walking behind me .
oh that ##s a nice su ##pr ##ise
ye ##a that ##s good they did
oh , who are they playing ?
that will be so fun !
i love ike ##a , they have good meat ##balls .
hopefully you can understand the instructions .
but it ' s good that you made friends though , right ? will you still be able to keep in touch with them ?
well then that ' s all the more reason to take more trips so you can see them ! maybe go on a couch ##sur ##fin ##g tour of the world !
did you go ?
that ##s good , keep going !

oh wow that sounds good to me
i like memories like that

what do you plan to do there
why were you scared
that does sound a little scary
it can be tough when friends have things that might be considered better than what you have . maybe it can be used as motivation
i am sure you are at least happy for your friend , right ?
i have done that . it happens to the best of us
i am sure no one really noticed
oh that was awkward
probably the best option
what kind of pet is it ?
no way ! they scare me : ( is it easy ?
ready for what ?
great . what is the test about ?
that ##s not fair ! what has he done that you haven ##t done ?
that ##s so annoying . iv ##e been in a similar situation . just keep working hard . you ##ll get there one day

stir fries are the bomb .
that ##s awesome . i wish i still had mine . i sold it a couple years ago
i wonder if there are any repair shops that could fix it
what happened ? are you ok ?
i mean they could have just run your items instead of making you mad .
i bet you were anxious to know how you did ! did you study up with friends or family leading up to the driver ' s test ?
oh well that ' s a bit different of a situation , lo ##l . i got ##cha ! i didn ' t know you had to re ##take the test if you accidentally let it ex ##pire . but i ' m sure you did great !

oh no that is truly tragic . people don ##t appreciate the older novel ##ties
you don ##t know what you got till its gone . . lo ##l the ignorance ! ! !
i could be wrong . . . but i feel like they just miss your company . . . and are using your grandma as a sc ##ape ##go ##at . don ' t be so hard on them they ' re not always gonna be around ; )
you must have a good , positive energy and that ' s what they miss . i used to be the same . but when they ' re dead and gone you ' ll miss the pest ##ering so love them for who they are , you ' re still free to make your own choices . peace
do you make them for a living or as a hobby ?
i ' ve never even attempted something so huge . you must be very creative and precise .
i ' m so sorry for your loss .
i hope you will be able to heal from this .

that is so awesome , so it was a real life advanced battle bot ##s . so amazing . congratulations !
you must be so excited !
i hope you have a great time !
how did you do that ?
wow , that ' s awful but you know , we all make dumb mistakes like that in desperate times .
that is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you !
i hope my kids say the same thing about me helping them that much when they grow up .
you must cook a lot of ta ##sty food all the time !
hmm did you try calling pest control
ye ##a that ##s true
i wish i could do that too
why were you scared
yeah , that does sound a little scary
good for you . how did you know what that meant ?
very nice . i need to learn some new words .
that sounds awesome , were are you going if you don ' t mind ?
nice ! the summer is the perfect time for the beach .
i remember my wife saying that when she was pregnant with both of ours . how far along are you ?
that is a very long time . is this your first ?
u ##gh i ' ve been there before . . . what do they do ?
ee ##ee ##w ##w ##w ##w . . . some people have no shame
how did it go ?
that ' s great news to hear !
same thing happened to me . . i believe it
they don ##t care about you unless you got tons of money in their back
is she coming back ?
oh ye ##a . . well you can face ##time or video chat in the meantime !
that would be awesome . what would you do with the winning ##s ?
ha ##ha ##ha have you ever been to hawaii ?

that ' s funny .
i love honda ##s . are you jealous of that person ?
i know that feeling , friend .
is it for a special event ?
i hope you are able to get it done in time - i love cheese ##cake so i ' m jealous i won ' t be there to eat it !
oh god . was it big ?
wow . does it happen often then ?
that ' s awesome , she sounds multi face ##ted .
that ' s human , when you live for a while you don ' t have to get stuff right the first time .
oh yeah baby , that sounds awesome . i don ' t know what it is , but those " buy in bulk " stores ' food cafes always have insane pizza . i ' m jealous !
believe me , i ' ve eaten my fair share of it . my step ##mo ##m used to take me and my brother there when we were younger . i ' ll always have fond memories of it . but you ' re right , i do need to go back and get some more sometime !
wow that sounds exciting and anxiety - inducing at the same time , hope it turns out well for you .
well it ' s good you have some friendly support in case it goes poorly .
oh wow . how many have they had now ? lo ##l
oh not that much really .
wow , that ' s a huge step . are you excited ?
i ' m sure it ' ll be amazing
oh wow . i ' m impressed he can make furniture ! is he busy ?
aw ##w ##w give him some time . i ' m sure he ' ll get to it eventually .
oh no ! did you over ##dra ##w your account ?
u ##gh , its the worst . i ' ve had that happen a few times to me . like a punch to the gut .
well , you definitely deserve it then !
how much of a raise are you getting ?
you sound like a very good friend !
i wish i had a friend like you .
i love ice cream cake , did you enjoy it ?
its just cake , there will always be another cake
i know what you mean , no one can get to you like your mom . but they are awesome .
oh yes , to be raised by or spend as much time with their family . it sure is a crazy world .
oh damn . did you do something to upset your dog ?
oh no . did something bad happen ?
they got a ton of worker bees following their command
ye ##a
i ' m sorry to hear that . will you get a day off soon ?
i ' ll pray for ya ! you need a break before you burn out .
i guess its an insect ?
i guess you have to asks its creator
oh i get you . it ' s been raining here everyday .
i hope you get some sun where you are , too . too much rain can get de ##pressing .
now that is one of the most unfortunate things i ' ve heard all week . how did you get it out of your hair ? ee ##w ##w
that , i think , is a pretty just ##if ##iable response honestly , lo ##l . now at the very least all you ' ll have to do is clean the umbrella !
wow . that ' s pretty amazing . you have been through quite a lot in life .
hopefully , it ' ll be smooth sailing from no onwards .
o ##oh ##h . . . if you ' re the girl that ' s ok . . . if you ' re a guy c ' mon buddy , bring some cash lo ##l
ts ##k ts ##k gotta have a backup . nothing turns a girl off more than having to pay for everything . . . they like the feeling of security
how much is the jack ##pot ?
that is a whole lot of money !
you were too good for them anyway !
im sure you will do great where ever you end up going
you must be a great student !
i wish you more success in your education .
yi ##kes . why did you take it may i ask ?
ah , well if you haven ' t sold it yet , there ' s still time to return it !
where were you all going to go ?
oh that sounds like fun
why were you scared ?
i feel like i have heard that a lot tonight
why are you surprised she asked you out ?
a lot of girls don ' t follow the traditional ways anymore .
it is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago , and we didn ' t even realize what we looked like usually at that time .
it ' s like you ' re looking at someone else almost .
why did they cancel
i guess work does that sometimes
impressive ! it is all going to be well worth it in the long run , keep going ghost rider !
if there ##s a will then there ##s a way ! er in most situations , were not talking about you trying to do brain surgery tomorrow or anything .
ha ##ha . that would have scared me so much .
you never know with those cats . they are very sly .
oh i hope it does ! i bet you ' ve got a super secret ingredient that makes it stand out from the rest of the ra ##bble .
then it will be appropriate if it pays off for you . if you win first prize , i ' m gonna need you to start getting it put in grocery stores so i can buy some !
what does she say ?
sounds scary
oh no . this sounds bad .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . have you tried calling your local she ##lth ##er or animal control ?
oh , sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans . i am sure you can go another time .
that ' s a bum ##mer . well i hope you can find another weekend to make up for it .
wow . a cruise sounds pretty amazing . where to ?
oh man . you ' ll get to spend time with the family , too . that ' s what ' s up .
that sounds so good !
i know right ! asian food is price ##y .
wow ! that ' s pretty amazing . how are you gonna spend it ?
ha ##ha ##ha still in shock , hu ? well , as long as it ' s the good of shock . : )
oh no what happened ?
do you think that if you apologized they would forgive you ?
why did you do that
i understand , people do it all of the time
why ? im sure you will be fine
ye ##a i can understand that
what happened ?
were you able to find your dog ?
oh damn . me too . what area are you in ?
northeast here . must be raining all along the coast .
are you happy with that
i guess it was just meant to be then
om ##g that is awful . how long did it take to recover ?
i bet ! i am glad it wasn ' t even for serious than it was already .
i know , i can ' t wait either !
i am root ##ing for the long ##horn ##s !
i guess people are way more rude these days aren ##t they
i do miss that as well , maybe it will come back
oh , that ' s got to feel rough . it ' s not quite the same , but i ' ve felt similarly when i couldn ' t get previous ex - girlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthday ##s or something . but i ' m sure she knows you love her anyway .
it does . feeling bad about it is enough to show you care about her , which is something , paradox ##ically , to feel good about i think . just keep being a good dad to her . : )
that is great . how old is she ?
at this age , they are cute .
you couldn ' t say no to working ?
that is a real bum ##mer . i ' m sorry that happened to you . will you be able to res ##ched ##ule your plans ?
i am sorry it didn ' t work out . but happy to hear you are happy now .
that is so wonderful , because that doesn ' t normally happen .
that must be annoying !
i hope that gets resolved soon .
yi ##kes . mine was 210 .
turn the ac up a little : )
it looks good . should i save my money ?
i thought the name was dumb too , but the preview ##s looked awesome . is it scary at all because i don ' t ll ##ike ant ##hing remote ##l scary
that sounds soo ##oo good ! i ' m eating low - car ##b right now but i ' m a push ##over for good mas ##hed potatoes !
lo ##l ! i ' ve done things like that before also , sometimes you just need some me time with some good food ya know ?
oh no , i hate when that happens
good luck , lots of coffee !
i think it is , that might make you feel better
its the perfect time to go see them then
that is tough . was it a big lie ?
you must be feeling pretty guilty . that sucks .
what kind of test was it
i am sure you will do better next time
oh gross ! that must have been disgusting to see .
wow , i can only imagine what other gross things she does .
is that a video game ? is it mario ?
i used to love mario ka ##rt - i ' m not a big video game fan but i loved that one . i can see why you are excited about it coming out !
what exactly did you see ?
wow that ' s very annoying , he should be arrested .
wow , how amazing is that ! ? i wish someone would do that for me ! i mean , i don ' t think i buy more than $ 30 of groceries at a time since it ' s just me , but still !
that ' s a wonderful idea , i love that ! and you know , if you find you can ' t quite do the exact same thing for someone else , you can always donate food to a food bank or something . it ' s the exact same thing , and it ' ll make you feel awesome .
oh that sucks ! maybe you can go the next day .
do you normally go very often ?
oh wow ! that is horrible ! ! did they get away with it ?
i am sorry to hear that . that is a bad incident to have happen on vacation
that is so exciting . is this your first ?
i guess you have a plan to induce labor , or a scheduled c - section ?
oh , do you think you did something wrong ?
that ' s terrible i wouldn ' t like for that to happen to me .
where did you go and what happened ?
that ' s too bad , did you get to the second place after ?
what are they coming to fix ?
oh my my , hope it gets fixed fast
woo ##ho ##oo . . . i bet you ' re ec ##static
i can ' t wait until my daughter is old enough to go to school lo ##l
that ' s great .
i know how that feels . its a good feeling to be on the right path finally
that sounds like a neat tradition . what did you guys do with the apples once they were all picked ?
sounds like a bunch of ta ##sty items ! my mom used to make a banging apple pie whenever i came home for thanksgiving . it was the best feeling in the world eating it .
that is amazing ! i ' m so happy for you ! what kind of car did they get you ?
hey , a new car is a new car ! i ' m dying from heat in my car since the a / c broke . have fun driving !
that ' s awesome ! how long do you think it will take you to build it ?
is this the first time you ' ve put a computer together ?
ah , i know that feeling well . my family moved around a ton while i was in grade school , so i don ' t really have many long term friends . don ' t worry though , you ' ll make friends at your new job so easily , you won ' t even remember you didn ' t have friends !
i mean yeah , it can ' t hurt , can it ? i ' m sure they ' ll be excited to meet you and get to know you as much as vice versa . plus , who knows ? your new best friend might be in there for all you know !
that bad huh ? what was wrong with ' em
they ? you went on a date with more than one person ? ?
that can be a scary thing to see
i like cats , but not those kind of cats
that does sound lonely . do you have friends to turn to ?
well that ##s good . if you can find a hobby to occupy those evenings that would be best .
oh no ! are you hurt ? don ' t even worry about them . it happens to the best of us .
i ' m glad you ' re okay . it is so embarrassing . i ' ve done that before but at least you got back up ! pride can heal and a body takes longer to !
i bet ! i am still too scared to ride one .
maybe i should get over my fear and finally ride one .
that ' s really sweet of him . how long have you been friends ?
what do you guys like to do for fun ?
aw , that ' s too bad . what kind of restaurant was it ?
dan ##g , what i would do for some sweet chinese now . did you find one to replace it ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . adolph must ' ve had a happy life though .
man . what was it like having a arm ##adi ##llo as a pet ?
that ' s really sad . were you close to him ?
i am sorry to hear that . i was pretty distraught when i lost my grand ##dad as well . may he rest in peace .

was it a really expensive one ?
that ' s awesome , it ' s nice to have friends that are role models
hard work is always rewarded !
that ' s great . where are y ' all from ?
i visited once there . the people are very nice .
why does that bother you ?
sometimes that ##s the best option .
ah that ##s so bad ! ! did you fix it yet ?
you would be irritated for couple of days then
well dan ##g man . it ' s never too late ! just hit her up on the ole facebook !
i am sure you two will be having babies in no time if you hit her up right this instant !
aw ##w ##w sorry bout your rug . . . there ' s a facebook group called dogg ##o you should follow . . . owners post pic ##s of their dogs with signs around their necks like " i like jumping out of moving cars just to po ##op in front of strangers " you might be less mad looking at them ha ##ha
yu ##p . but here ' s a link https : / / www . facebook . com / dogg ##oco ##m / photos / pc ##b . 51 ##17 ##13 ##6 ##22 ##60 ##9 ##18 ##7 / 51 ##17 ##11 ##85 ##26 ##0 ##9 ##36 ##4 / ? type = 3 & theater

oh like a raise ? if you worked hard they should give it to you
oh how did you miss that ?
ah that ##s so bad ! ! . you are right in this age we need to get rid of this written checks

that is great to hear . are you good at math ?
i hope you do well then
right , sometimes i feel the same way when i feel like i should have something , but then i realize i would get bored from it after a while like everything
yeah , and it ' s just one more thing you have to keep track of
oh ##h . good for him . some guys are born lucky
oh ##h don ' t feel bad . i am sure someday you will get one .
you are so brave to do that !
your dog is very lucky !
iv ##e had one dogg that i love , but since she did its been hard to love again .
yeah she was an older family dog .
engaging in conversation , whether the spoken or written word helps to further communication along .
you are doing a great job ! you are following our conversation naturally .
did he at least take you out to lunch with the winning ##s ?
maybe you will win next time .
i can ##t imagine seeing one in real life . i would be so scared .
i don ##t think i could go anywhere where they may be . its terrifying to think about .
i agree . that is rude and annoying . how do you handle it ?
i generally tend to start walking away from them .
holy cow ! i think i would have passed out if i was you !
oh wow , you probably shouldn ' t be drinking and driving tho .
i am sure that makes you feel bad , have you talked to them about how you feel ?
that is a sticky situation to be in
oh i ' m glad you got it ! did someone call out for you ?
you had that instinct .
i would be happy too if i had that . what kind of cat do you have ?
aw , well it ' s good that you guys took him in . you ' re a kind soul ##d .
i think some kids go through that . did your parents comfort you ?
oh no . did you get much sleep as a kid at all ?
oh god . that must be terrifying .
oh lord . they ' re still there ?
that sounds very fortunate . good timing .
pets are amazing in that way . glad he was there for you when you needed it .
boy , what i would do for a slice o that right now . what kind of pizza is it ?
dan ##g , i bet that ' ll be better than that racist papa john ' s pizza !

ah that ##s horrible . did you take her to the doctor ' s ?
oh man . did you get a chance to say goodbye ?
hm must ' ve been a big gold ##fish .
that ' s pretty cool . maybe you could toss me a few recipes for recently deceased gold ##fish ?
no , no ! i swear i don ' t ! i meant the crack ##er gold ##fish ! the crack ##ers ! ! !
on no ! did you get hurt ?
i bet ! i would be too ! i am so sorry that happened to you .
that ' s exciting ! i have no idea how that sport is even played , but i ' m glad you go to go see it ! did the team you were root ##ing for win ?
i will definitely be on the lookout for it . that is awesome though , you were supporting your team ! you may have been all by yourself , but you were the only one getting to celebrate ! hell yeah , brother !
well , you can call her today and make up for it ?
why did you lie to her ?
wow how did that happen ? ?
well i ' m sure you figured out your mistake right away !
you should do it . i think you ' ll do great .
where are you going to go on your first date ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . why did it happen ?
ye ##a . so you didn ' t get that warning not to date crazy , hu ?
oh gross , did you spit it back out ?
oh no ! i ' m so sorry to hear that . maybe it ' s not that bad ? just drink a lot of water
that ' s terrible , my friend . is there a chance to get it in the near future ?
i am sure you will . just gotta keep kicking butt and taking names !
u ##gh , i hate that ! what are they doing to ir ##rita ##te you ?
that ' s horrible - can you complain the complex or ho ##a ? or figure out a way to cut their power is always an option ?
that ##s going to take forever
aw . i do that too . i still have my old cell phones with videos of mt babies doing nothing lo ##l
hm is there a reason you are going ? have you been experiencing chronic pain ?
that sucks . i hope it helps !
pets are great companions . mine follow me around everywhere and i am sure you cat does the same thing
animals are pretty intuitive . that are great at picking up people ' s moods i have found
oh yeah ? was it any good ?
oh i see . what made you finally decide to try it out ?
well that is def a big decision to consider
it is a life change ##r for sure . it will change the everyday activities in your life
that ' s exciting ! what car did you get ?
great car ! i love sub ##arus , my favorite is the imp ##re ##za with turbo
aw , that ' s so sweet . why would you say such a thing ?
sounds like a great girlfriend . i am sure she will be around for whenever you need her like you did last week .
oh sounds exciting ! how ' d it go
i should try it one day ! were you afraid of heights ?
oh what was it about ? was it for an event ?
that sounds like a touching moment . how wonderful for you !
oh ##h that ' s bad . how did you feel ?
oh ##h i am so sorry . that one ' s my favorite too ! but , i feel bad for you .
i am sure you had a really good reason right ?
oh wow , i hope you get some help soon .
ah that ' s so sad . you would miss your favorite one . i think you need to find something else
you will definitely will
that must ' ve really upset you . did they explain why ?
definitely take some time to vent out your anger . it ' s totally und ##est ##anda ##ble .
wow ! what platform was it for ? nintendo or atari or sony ?
sounds like you had a great childhood , you can try playing it now by download ##ing an em ##ulator ha ##ha , i tried that and it was great
that ##s nice of you to rely on a friend .
then you got good set of friends . don ' t lose them for your life ! !
alright , i can get behind that . sisters - in - law are usually angry mess ##es of human beings anyway , so i ' ll back you up on that . what did she do though ?
yeah that ' s pretty unacceptable . as a former teacher myself , i can assure you that as much as i loved those kids , my kids would always come first no matter what .
that ' s too bad . in all fairness , no one really needs a good car . i have a beat ##er , but it ' s get me from place to place . that ' s all that really matters .
i am sure you ' ll reach your goal one day . i do hope you get that brand span ##king new car .
did you say something
did your girlfriend like that
i hope you do well on it ! do you feel prepared ?
that ' s great ! make sure to check your answers twice !
i do too ! love going out and swimming in the ocean . why do you like going ?
i love doing that too and the price is totally worth it .
being alone or going bowling - or both ?
i ' d get some new friends that ' s for sure ! ! it stink ##s when they don ' t stick with you !
oh man , what are you getting that for ? i hope everything is okay .
i am sure . i do hope that they find the cause .
what was the gift ? i can imagine it was something wonderful .
was it colorful or did it play a tune ?
are there any favorite tunes that it plays ?
did you try clear it ?
okay do it continue , it will clear
i can relate . what ' s the sad ##des ##t movie you ' ve ever watched ?
ye ##a , that ' s a really emotional one for a lot of people . i see that one mentioned a lot for tear jerk ##ers .
that ' s terrible ! are the police doing anything about it ?
oh man . well , be careful out there . wouldn ' t want anything to happen to you or your family .
me too , sometimes i still get scared to stare into mirrors in the dark
ha ##ha ##ha , me too definitely
yi ##kes , did it take long to clean it up ?
well i hope your dog is feeling better , it would be bad if he was feeling sick or stressed
i am sure you will present a stellar product . what is the power ##point on ?
sounds pretty cool . i am sure he will end up investing .
oh yeah ? what is the name ?
oh ok . that is a real ##y good show . i watch it too .
that ' s too bad . do you have any friends or other family that you can do that with ?
i am sure . i do hope you find peace with your football watching and your good ole dad .
that ##s gross . did you punish the dog at all
poor dog , i hope she learns from it
really ? what was his first word ?
that is a really complex word !
that ' s really great to hear . i love my wife too . what does she do that make you appreciate her every day ?
mine does the same ! it ' s nice coming home to a clean house everyday .
ah that must have been surprise for you
you should also reach out to her
i do feel bad for them as well , its tough to see
people have to look after themselves
wow , that ' s amazing ! i ' m insane ##ly jealous ! i think it ' s pretty normal to be scared of that though . after all , it wouldn ' t be nearly as much fun if it didn ' t terri ##fy you , right ?
exactly ! embrace the danger . become the danger . do like 800 flip ##s while you ' re falling through the air , but do yourself a favor and don ' t vomit okay ?
ah that ##s really gross ! ! . i hate it road authority do not clear dead animals from the roads asa ##p
we need to do an online petition and raise a complaint against authority ! !
nice ! is it your first time buying ?
good to hear . i hope the house warming party is banging .
om ##g . i think i would have passed out .
did you take the time to walk her outside ?
ah that ##s so sad . why did she is leaving her though ?
i am so sure you will miss her . keep in touch with her though
oh no i ' m so sorry to hear that
i bet , stay strong !
nice ! did you get the job ?
wow . . . i am really sorry , friend . any other interviews lined up ?
i hate when that happens and i don ##t even have a dog
are there places you can take the dog where they teach them not to do that
i ' m sorry . it happens to all of us .
i am sure you can go back .
yeah ? is it decorated well or just very large ?
wow , i bet . he must make a lot of money !
i feel the same way . i never thought kids could be that mean !
it is so sad . i worry everyday about my school age kids .
what kind of ladder was it
you can always try again tomorrow
that ##s amazing , and also i would be a little en ##vious , i just want love .
i believe its out there for all of us , we just gotta find it .
oh no ! ha ##v you been out looking for her ?
did you put your phone number and things on the sign ?
that ' s too bad . maybe you should get a new one ?
i certainly would . how can you jam out to all the now cd ' s without it ?
why didn ' t you want to go anywhere ?
well , in that case it ' s better that you just relax .
yeah , what happened next ?
why were you not sleeping
have you taken the test yet
if you studied really hard then you should
that ' s terrible . have you confronted him about it ?
i ' m not sure what that means , but you should talk to him about it !
good luck with that . are you well prepared ?
cool .
i would do that too . it ' s a waste of money if you don ' t finish it !
i am sorry you felt that way .
on no . did you get a letter from the irs ?
yeah i would to if i was in your position .
oh my ! what a smell ##y situation . were you able to clean it up and get the smell out ?
is her litter box full ? my cat does that when it is too full and i neglect to clean it .
that ' s such an awful feeling ! i at least do it twice a year - _ -
i feel you . last time i did that i was late for work . . . i hate it when it happen ##ds .
hmm ##m , maybe that ' s because you ate it and you ' ve got a sugar rush . i wouldn ' t worry ! that usually fades in a couple hours .
eh , it ' s okay . don ' t beat yourself up about it . it ' s truly a victim ##less crime . there are much , much worse things you could have done , i promise .
i really hate when that happens
next time call the police
no way , that ' s gross . what happened ?
that ' s disgusting . some people are pigs .
oh wow . do you think you might get sick ?
i don ' t think that ' s very healthy .
that ##s nice family should not fight forever
you only get one family
you must be happy for her ! !
ah that sucks ! ! but you can ' t help it . it ' s your friend ' s decision
what a jerk ! why is she always in your bi ##z ?
i would get up in her face and show her who ' s boss . break out the broom and crack it across her old , me ##as ##ly back !
20 pizza ##s ! ! ! how did you fit that in your stomach without it exploding ?
i think i ' d look into entering some eating contests if i were you !
oh no . . . i hope it ' s for the best
good luck : )
it ' s okay to have cheat days sometimes ! start again tomorrow !
what type of diet are you following ?
that is interesting . did you have a good time ?
i bet ! i would be too scared to even try !
i hope you can get treated .
i am sure you will get better .
oh no ! did she say anything about it ?
i think that as a bit harsh ! it wasn ' t like you did it on purpose thinking it would be funny or anything .
wow , did that bother your co - workers ?
you might want to find a new job
ah , i certainly know the feeling of bringing back old memories . it ' s fun to go back and remember the people you shared all those classes with , isn ' t it ?
i know exactly what you mean ! all the old flames , the old rival ##ries , everything is like it was yesterday . it ' s a pretty cool feeling .
awesome . is he learning to cook for the first time ?
oh wow . well good for him ! i know that makes you happy !
is that a favorite of yours ? i ' ve never watched it .
i know how you feel . i ' ve had shows that i ' ve loved that have ended and it ' s like losing a best friend . i ' m sorry it ' s ending .
why what happened
oh i only have a few more years with mine too
yeah ? me too , i used to be afraid of aliens . what were you scared of ?
yes he could be ! maybe you should check under the bed right now . he could be watching you .
what a jerk . why doesn ' t he get a job at mcdonald ##s ?
i would remove him from your family tree . that will show him .
credit card ? that seems like an invasion of privacy
yeah , maybe have a talk with her . or maybe think positive , she might be getting you a gift ? ha ##ha
story of my everyday life . i swear i ear a jingle for hours
u ##gh , its such a weird brain function .
i bet ! you may have to wash your car to get that smell out !
lo ##l . hopefully that will be the last one you run over .
what did you do ?
it ' s good that you went easy on her .
that ' s terrible ! did you confront them about it ?
sounds like the right move . good on you for standing up for yourself .
how come ? were you scared you wouldn ' t wake up ?
aw ##w , that ' s sad to hear . i hope you didn ' t lose too much sleep !
that ' s too bad . have you seen a doctor about it ?
ah , makes sense . just drink milk everyday and it should be fine in a week .
that ' s pretty dumb . did you eventually get the part ?
ah . what a terrible inc ##on ##ven ##ience !
oh no ! how are you going to clean it out ?
yi ##kes ! that must have been terrible
nice ! how did that feel ?
oh , how did she look ? still pretty ?
wow how much
that ##s a nice chunk of change
that ' s really annoying . was the wrong order any good ?
hm . . judging from your conditions , maybe mcdonald ' s isn ' t the best place for your to eat anyway !
i think that ##s a positive thing . motivation is the key . do you think he ' ll follow through and actually attend the gym ?
you will be a great motivation ##al coach . such po ##sit ##ivity !
on no . don ##t be too hard on yourself . you must have needed the rest .
i understand . but you are human !
that ' s awful ! were you able to clean it off ?
oh no , i hope you can get the shoe removed from your foot .
aw , that ' s exciting ! i think i would swell with pride if a swear word were my kid ' s first word too !
wow ##ao ##ea ##oe ##ae ##oh ##hh ##h , now that was unexpected ! are you at all concerned that you ' re raising a communist , or have you decided to embrace the hammer and sick ##le and seize the means of production ?
were you any good in high school or was it just fun ?
oh okay well that sounds nice . i haven ' t played much tennis but i miss having more free time to do similar ho ##bbies .
awesome ! what breed is your dog ?
how sweet . i might get one myself then .
hey now , you ' re an all star ! did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence ?
yeah , they ' re a great group . very fun and up ##lifting .
how fun ! i remember the good old days with those games you didn ' t need a monthly subscription to
yeah they ' re all pay to play , i think you should be able to play the whole game the first time you buy it . . .
why don ' t you change your provider ?
why you don ' t have a choice ?
that must be annoying .
you should call the police on him .
well , they deserve it . medical school is not easy and they spent un ##ima ##gina ##ble effort and hard work to finish it
i truly respect and admire those people . they are the most beneficial members of the society
well maybe he trusted you as a good friend , next time try to help him with his homework instead
oh yeah , that ' s not great . next time make sure to say no directly to his face
i am sure you will ! did you make sure you took time working on it ?
then i know you will do great ! good luck !
i love boots fall is best for fashion
now you have me excited too
is she still single ? some people don ' t like to be in a relationship
ha ##ha ##ha , well she found the " one " i guess
yi ##kes , that sounds ho ##rri ##fying
i would be grossed out too
you are lucky to have that in your community .
it is good that you care about that too .
that ##s the worst part , i just finished one as ##well , ended up doing pretty well .
yep , its the not knowing that gets to you most .
uh oh . i am sorry . what happened ?
i am sorry . at least you tried .
do you have a pet
did you gave any pet name to your cat
oh yeah me too . they can be so rude .
you are right . some people should never drive a car again !
i understand that feeling sometimes .
you can tell me anything .
why ##s that ? ? were they growing out of them /
wow , that ##s slightly harsh , but they have to learn some way .
i like that too
i wants had a smooth ##ie that was terrible there
what a wonderful time for your family ! is it a boy or girl ?
oh fun ! a little girl will be a great addition to the family
but america is so great now ! look at all the great things that are happening and are great
no , he truly is lower than a dog himself
really ? ? ? a power out does not sound that scary
now , that is scary ! ! without power for days would be a nightmare
why and what ' s ho ##a ?
the thing i don ' t like is that the ho ##a monitors that type of stuff .
did you get really wet ? i hope you didn ' t catch a cold
oh well i ' m sure they didn ' t judge you , it could happen to anyone
i think we all did lo ##l
that had to be a long time ago
yeah may be kids changed nowadays ! !
then you should ins ##ti ##gate something in school ! !
do you like old western movies
that ' s ok , i did not know much about it
ah , new version of tom and jerry . you would be thinking whether to get or not ! !
you should then wait for it . not sure how much time it will take though ! !
i hope so too , what kind of operation is it ?
i don ' t believe in god , but i hope you have a good doctor
oh that ' s so sad , how often do you get to visit them ?
maybe video chat them a bit more , talk to them daily to let them feel your presence
that ' s great . i should visit you once for your great pasta ! !
you are so skill ##ful ! ! you should start your own brand ! !
who is the singer ?
i am a huge fan of hers too !
fun , did you play with your siblings ?
ah ##h , i don ' t have any siblings but i bet it was a great time
oh man , that ' s so disappointing when they do that . starts off the whole day wrong .
yeah small hint of peace in the morning before your he ##ctic work day starts and all those meetings .
i know what you mean . i feel the same sometimes but honestly it ' s not real ##isto ##c
that is true . they probably look way different in person
how come ? do you not trust him ?
oh don ' t think like that , it will only make things worse . just be supportive and focus on yourself
oh i bet ! did you just go on vacation ?
wow so happy for you . i have always wanted to go myself .
oh no , that is terrible .
i ' m sorry that happened to you .
fun , what concert is it ?
who ##op ! it ' s gonna be a fun time !
wow ! did you confront her about it ?
what a horrible thing to witness
ya ##y ! where are you going ? are you excited ?
wow , you are so lucky , i love the beach
aw , that ' s a shame . is he a house dog or an outside one ?
i would be as well . i would just keep a close eye on him whenever you can . be his eyes .
oh well you can celebrate it a couple days late , it ' s fine
don ' t worry , just appreciate him everyday
aw ##w ##w ##w . . its tough leaving lifelong family pets
i don ##t blame you . i moved out at 17 and i couldn ##t ever move back . .
i hope you pass ! you tried your best
you should celebrate when you hear back !
i have done that way too many times , maybe use the air dr ##ter in the bathroom ?
that ##s hilarious and terrible at the same time .
do you just walk alone usually ?
maybe you can invite someone every now and then , like a neighbor or someone you trust .
she sounds like a good person .
you also sound like a good person .
did you do good ? or get smacked around al ##ot ?
that ##s right ! they didn ##t wanna to see the slaughter anymore .
how sweet . what breed is the dog ?
oh ok . that is so nice of y ' all . that does not happen often enough .
really ? why do you do that ?
yeah i understand that . i hope you feel better !
me too , i am very lucky to have moved . i used to live in a place with a lot of earthquakes and hurricanes
yes , it ' s a traumatic experience to be in an earthquake
that is a good way to think .
i like your positive attitude !
where did you go ? did you enjoy yourself ?
why ? ? its good time to think
oh i am sorry to hear that . you will get another chance i am sure
don ' t feel too hard on yourself . i am sure you did your best .
oh why not ! ! quality is better than quantity ! !
ah that is also there . you will make new friends ! !
oh no my dear , what happened to your leg ?
oh wow . was it a bad car wreck ?
good for you . social ##izing through such ways is a great way to enjoy your time . and besides , i am not star wars fan and have not watched any of the movie series
costume parties are very fun to attend . if i ever attend one , then i will go in iron man suit . i just love that character and its personality
it sounds like you are a loyal customer ! how did you feel about them taking your head ##phone jack from their cell ##phones ?
i suppose that ' s true , although i heard a lot of people were not happy with it .
that sounds scary !
good thing you didn ' t get lost !
oh my god , just your luck huh , that ##s crazy .
me either , i have broken every phone iv ##e owned !
what happened ? ? did you ever get it back ? ! ?
did they have an ex ##ple ##nation on what happened ?
are you excited ?
how exciting ! hopefully it doesn ' t hurt too bad .
wow i bet you were surprised !
lo ##l a bat , how random
that ' s amazing ! i love finding new places like that .
i hope it does and you can keep going there ! ha ##ha
did you cover it up or tell them about it ?
now that is what i am talking about !
whoa ! how are you feeling from it now ?
it ' s okay to give in to craving ##s every now and then .
wow you were able to do that ?
you should reduce the intake ! !
why ##s that ? ! is it rotting out ?
that ##s gross , go see the dentist please !
unfortunately , it happens to all of us .
you will if you believe you can !
what did you order ? ! was it delicious ?
that ##s awesome , i love app ##lb ##ees , i like to drink there al ##ot
true friends can be tested at such situations . good for you to have such friends . it is very rare to have such ones
i have only 2 - 3 close friends with whom i closely associate . i think that is the ideal number one should have
i agree ##e , and i see no point in it , this is all our country we are all one here , why fight .
very bleak , maybe we will have some sort of saving grace candidate .
i could imagine , we have a whole mountain of it around my apartment building just randomly lying around .
exactly ! i ' d like to pick it up with a scoop ##er and throw it in their faces .
oh my god ! did you confront him about it ?
perfect , make him think you don ##t know , or don ##t know everything .
om ##g i ' d be so upset . did you confront him about it ?
i wish you all the luck !
oh no ! did they even leave a note of any kind ?
i ' d be liv ##id ! some people just won ' t let us have nice things , i swear .
that sounds great , i hope you get it !
i ' m always nervous at job interviews !
oh no , were you able to calm him down ?
i ' m glad he was able to get some relief from that storm anxiety
i am sorry to hear that . was it a clean break ?
i can understand that . it is hard at first but then it gets better .
i ' m very sorry for your loss .
i hope you will be at peace soon .
oh no ! what was he accused of ?
well maybe this will teach him a lesson and he ' ll come out of prison a new man .
uh oh , is everything okay ? are you nervous ?
that ##s true , its always good to get testing and pre ##ca ##ution ##ary procedures .
dar ##n , have you been working towards one lately ?
have you been passed over it before ?
really ! i bet he was a real manly man then !
it ' s always nice to have someone show you things . you ' re very lucky .
that sounds great , were you nervous about the interview ?
i hope you get the job !
that ' s good . dogs are the best but an obe ##die ##nt dog is even better !
i can ' t wait to have a dog . maybe when my daughter is older . .
oh that much , will you be able to do it ?
that ' s the confidence . i am sure you will do it
i know exactly what you mean .
i ' m glad that you care about others .
lo ##l ! ! im sorry about that , did you get him back ?
ha ##ha ##ha , that ##s true , that ##s not the worst outcome
oh man ! ! i hope you are ok . please tell me someone recorded it
that sounds like a crazy day
ee ##k ! hopefully your keyboard isn ' t acting up !
that ' s a good idea ! or use a vacuum if you can .
better be careful ! the weather has been bad here lately too .
nothing worse than being un ##pre ##par ##ed for a disaster
oh , what job is it ?
wow , that is very high position !
oh my god , that ##s al ##ot of ham , did he throw it up after ?
that ##s a real eater right there , big belly .
aw ##w , i can remember the first time my son said daddy . i thought my heart was going to explode .
it really is . kids can sure bring a wave of emotions upon us .
that ' s amazing ! you must be so happy
hard work pays off
i do that all the time lo ##l hey , if it ' s in there it ' s up for grabs !
he should have eaten it sooner !
yes there have been . i live in south texas and they are bad here
yeah those do help . set up a per ##imi ##ter
i ' m sure you ' ll make new friends really soon .
that ' s a great idea ! maybe go to the park too and meet people there .
oh how horrible . i ' m sorry sorry to hear that .
aw ##w i hope so too . dogs are precious and they aren ' t here long . we have to be happy for our time with them no matter what .
i ' m sure you did amazing , did you study hard for it ?
when will you find out your scores ?
that would be great ! it would certainly save you from having to buy a new car for a while .
what kind of car can you win ?
sounds super fun
ye ##a have a cat , i like him
that sucks , i hate when that happens !
did you return the favor at all so to speak ?
that ' s good ! have you met in person ?
totally understand ##able . . . i ' d be a bit app ##re ##hen ##sive too
really ! that ' s awesome ! was there something new in it you don ' t usually use ?
i think las ##ag ##na is one of my favorite things to make
it can be a fun thing as long as one doesn ' t go overboard .
yeah , i have had some legendary hang ##overs . i try to moderate better these days ha ##ha .
that sounds really relaxing and nice .
well hopefully it doesn ' t rain or anything .
its understand ##able , they are so annoying
ye ##a i hate it
oh no im sorry to hear that
it ' ll get better in time
that ##s insane stuff
man that ##s really dish ##ear ##ten ##ing , you should type faster tho
that ' s great ! w ##hee ##r are you gonna go ?
that ' s a fun place to go . you ' ll have to be sure to take lots of pic ##s !
you can ' t believe they did it without asking or that the car needed the repairs ?
wow i hope everything works out for you !
wow , that ' s crazy . is it very cold where you are living ?
interesting you say that . here it ' s warm as well and we had a big rain storm and got some large hail as well !
that ##s quite nice of them
ye ##a i bet that feels good
oh no ! hope your cat is feeling okay .
that ' s the thing about pets , hard to stay mad at them !
that ' s so impressive !
hopefully , she seems really smart .
that must be so hard to deal with
he seems to be on the right path now then
wow did anyone let you at least know ?
wow that is super un ##lu ##cky , did she notice at all ?
that ##s really annoying to deal with
still tho that ##s dangerous
im sorry to hear that . loss of a pet is tough
are you planning on getting another pet ?
how long do you have to wait ?
good luck ! i ' m sure you did great .
oh wow , how long has it been since you got last promoted ?
well i hope you get it !
are you prepared for it ? did you study ?
i know what you mean . i think you ' ll do great though .
sounds quite hard to deal with but good luck
ye ##a i would be too
i definitely understand that feeling . it took me forever to sign up for my speech communications class because of speaking in public .
i actually took it late evening class without too many students and even was scared and only had to speak in front of the professor .
what do you mean by that ?
that ' s fair , having a father figure be present is really important .
i hate shark movies too . that ' s why i refuse to swim in the ocean .
the only way i ' ll get in is if i ' m too drunk to care if i get eaten lo ##l
congratulations ! that is great news to hear !
yes ! it is always good to have a positive attitude .
life can have some sudden turns . but these are very little chances to count on and hope for
good for him . but do not count on such things happening in life . they are very rare unless you put hard work to get them
that sucks , hopefully you can come back from that
that is usually pretty unlikely but i ' m root ##ing for you .
that sounds nice , how long has it been ?
indeed , enjoy your time away !
what kind of games ?
oh i enjoyed board games when i was little too
o ##of sounds so bad
i bet it was
oh no , that must have been embarrassing !
did anyone see it happen ?
wow , that must ' ve been really scary !
i ' m sure i would ' ve been shaking as well !
what do you mean exactly ? she doesn ' t have the same passion when speaking to you ?
oh wow , i ' m sorry to hear that . that must hurt .
wow . are you ok ? that can be really un ##ner ##ving
i would be to . people need to be more aware on the road
that ##s very cute to do that
ye ##a i bet it does
i love watching heavy storms with thunder and light ##ening !
yeah , as long as it is loud but not too close i usually love it !
that sounds terrible , i hate losing a pet . . .
did you end up getting another ever ?
that ' s great ! it ' s such a good feeling working with people you actually like . .
i hope you have more nights like it !
that ' s great ! what are some things you ' re enjoying about life right now ?
oh man , having weekends off is such a deal breaker for me too .
kids are sweet . they will do everything to get what they want . so , did her mom made him kraft dinner eventually ?
don ' t be upset about it . kids do not yet have conscious ability to think concrete ##ly in terms of other ' s feelings
that ' s very nice of you . i hope she gets the issues sorted out !
yes , i can imagine it must be hard for you as well . i wish you guys all the best .
that is terrible . never ##mind being em ##bara ##ssed i would have been mad and hungry ! !
i don ##t blame you
that ' s a good sign you did great then @
good luck ! i hope you get it .
oh no ! i would have asked for the manager ! what did you do ?
i can ' t imagine why that person would do that ! so unreasonable .
was there any reason you couldn ' t go ? did they not invite you ?
that ' s wonderful ! i hope you had or have a great time !
that ' s so cool ! i really wish i had a dog !
i really like cats but i want a dog at some point .
u ##gh , i hate when that happens . do you think the cat ate something bad ?
i bet . poor kitty , i hope he / she feels better soon .
i bet it did i would be too
i bet it is , good luck with tha
oh yeah i hate rats too actually .
oh wow that sounds so scary ! i might have done the same actually !
i am not a fan of snake ##d either .
i once was bitten by a snake , luckily it had no venom .
sorry to hear that . must feel quite lonely for you .
luckily you can always contact your husband to see how he is doing and hear his voice .
oh no , did you tell them ?
if it ' s not bad , , i wouldn ' t tell them
ha ##ha , welcome to tin ##der ! it ' s the app of mixed signals . did things work out finally ?
yeah , usually you just move on . there are plenty more fish in the sea !
i know what you mean , scary movies really terri ##fy me !
that ' s always a great way to make me feel more at ease !
same here , who accused you ?
fr ##ick isn ' t a curse word .
same here ! what makes you nervous >
yeah that ' s the same reason as me .
that is bad news . my mother is going through the same thing unfortunately . landlord became widow ##d and now is moving with her daughter in an ##oth ##e state so will be selling the house
that is tough . my mother ##e also has her little dog . but more than likely she will move in with my family
double the fun , are these your first children ?
cong ##rat ##s , you should try to sleep some thou .
you sound very confident ! how will you make that happen ?
great ! i wish i could find a profitable business . i don ' t like worker for other people .
i have not seen those but that sounds cute . are you married ?
yep there ' s nothing wrong with either of those things !
i hate those kind of storms for good reasons . we have lightning storms all the time in georgia . the power is more than likely to go out .
yes indeed , i ' ve had to deal without power for 48 hours the last bad storm . almost three years ago , i was actually struck by lightning while in my home .
that ##s so cool , nice job of him '
that ##s great good for you .

i do not like tin ##der . what did she do ?
that is too bad , don ' t give up hope thou .
oh that is pretty terrifying ! what caused it ?
oh that ' s a relief though !
that could have been a scary situation . how was the party ?
that ' s good . i guess you never know what to expect sometimes .
i love disney world , who are you going with ?
hopefully you have enough time to see all the parks .
oh no ! don ' t blame yourself . it happens
better luck next time !
that ##s a fair point
ye ##a i bet it is
that ' s great , how did it go ?
yep that ' s the way to do it !
that would be cool . do you have singing experience ?
so am i . im a guitar player , not a singer
did you figure out a way to pay it thou ?
that was very nice of her .
aw that ' s the worst , especially when the clothes are new !
that ' s pretty annoying that nobody told you !
wow , that ' s good for him . what do you think changed for him ?
that ' s cool ! it ' s always good to hear when people decide to take a good step forward .
are you happy for him ?
do you have a girlfriend ?
i ' ve never even heard of that before !
oh cool ! sounds like fun !
why do you say that ? are you worried about the current state of affairs ?
he may not . he has certainly made a few enemies .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that about your grandmother . i ' m close to my grandmother so i would definitely need for the doctors to provide the best of care . i ' m sure you are looking for a speedy recovery .
that ' s a great position to take especially when something like this occur . it puts so many things in perspective on what ' s important . i ' m glad you have good doctors so you can focus on just being there for her .
oh no ! i always like to pick out what i ' m wearing the night before . maybe that would help ?
it really could help . i heard einstein used to wear the same clothes everyday because it would help him stay focused on his studies !
eh its worth it tho
still worth it im ##o
that was nice of them , did you pay them ?
that was nice , you should help them next time .
what did you get him ?
does he grill a lot ?
why would you do that ?
oh so it was your work ? that ' s understand ##able then .
wow that doesn ' t sound like a very good relationship . did you talk to her about it ?
wow i ' m sorry i hope you can figure something out !
good for you . i had couple of interviews couple of years ago . was very nervous , but thankfully they all went well . my advice , just try to hide your nervous ##ness and show confidence
so when are you expected to hear back for final decision on your hire ?
that ##s under ##sta ##bled i get it
i get what you me ##am
what ? ! ? ! how ? what happen ##d if you don ##t mind me asking
wow . glad to hear you are ok

you must of been so proud of him .
will he be going to college ?
did you get the b ?
that is great news , good job .
oh that sucks . what role were you applying for ?
cool , sorry to hear that you didn ' t get it .
how did he do that ?
that is great , do you ever help him study ?
i ' m not that into sports . what do you like about them ?
that ' s fair , good for them then !
aw ##w . . i am so sorry for your loss . it is so hard to lose our loved ones .
it sometimes helps to remember the good times you had together .
oh no ! what had happened ?
gee ##z , hopefully they get caught someday for driving so reckless . good to hear you are okay .
that ##s smart of you
i would always do that
that sounds great , it ' s always nice to have a new place to play like that !
glad you have a place like it to enjoy
how long dd you do that for ?
the cat must of got tired .
where did you meet her ?
that was brave of you to talk to her .
that ' s always a good idea . i respect that .
that ' s a good way to be a parent . they will grow up to be more honest and respectable .
how long has he been in the navy ? i have a bonus son ( my son ' s best friend ) who has been in the navy for about a year now .
that ' s a nice commitment . my father is an air force veteran . i ' m not too fond of the military , but it definitely makes a difference in the lives of many .
yes , i love 80s rock n roll .
yes , i wish i could go back in a time machine .
u ##gh , tell me about it . her and trump both make me feel that way .
he doesn ' t really say anything of substance in my opinion . just vague words . but hey , to each his own !
does she come over every day ?
maybe you should cook for her one night .
i am sure a b or a - is just as good . which class was it ?
oh ##hh that ' s a hard subject . i struggled with physics a lot , but not as much as chemistry .
that ' s so lucky ! how much did you win ?
that ' s a good amount , cool !
are you going to see her again ?
i thought you hit it off thou ?
wow i would be so sad if i saw that
ye ##a i would die if i saw that
oh god , what happened ?
i ' m glad you are okay . that sounds terrifying !
congratulations . that is very good luck you had . to be honest , i am not really interested in those scratch tickets as i think they are just waste of my hard earned money
good . but my advice to you is do not count on them too much as they have astronomical ##ly low chances of winning even anything at all
holy cow , that ' s a large limit ! and i thought my $ 2500 limit was decent !
just be careful and don ' t get too excited and start sw ##ip ##ing it all over !
wow , that ' s pretty impressive ! have you been training a lot ?
that ' s awesome to have that type of dedication .
when is her birthday ?
where will you have the party ?
where did he meet her ?
not when , where i asked ?
i hope so too ! so are you a teacher or substitute or what ?
what kind of math do you teach ?
what did you steal from him ?
why don ' t you return it ?
same , especially being as attractive as he is .
he pretty much has everything at this point .
where and when did this happen ? i haven ' t looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news . the last incident of the duck boat accident was very sad ##den ##ing .
oh wow . i will definitely need to look at that . was there many casualties ?
i think kids should all be home school ##ed .
they can hire teachers to come to the house .
i love ta ##cos ! do they serve other mexican food ?
sounds del ##ish ! i really like moe ##s southwest grill . if you get the chance you should try it .
sorry to hear that , will you get another dog ?
do you have any other pets ?
that ' s non fun . i ' m sorry to heard that . maybe you shouldn ' t go there anymore ?
the food is not very healthy so you are not missing much
that ##s no fun ! i love to swim and be in the pool or beach . but i work too much to go
yes you should . its not hard !
i love cruises , where is your cruise headed ?
have you ever been there before ?
sorry to hear that . it ' s tough when unexpected things like that happen .
man , the tax system needs a complete overhaul . hope things work out for you in the future .
did you tell him you wanted it ?
will he buy you a cake when you shop next time ?
you sound very confident ! what sport do you play ?
that sounds fun ! i like boats , but i don ' t think i would be a good rower .
what plane crash are you referring to ?
i never heard about it . i ' m glad nobody died though !
why don ' t you do the same thing ?
all you can do is keep working hard .
happy birthday to you ! i love birthday ##s so much . just recently celebrated by youngest daughter ' s 14th birthday on august 9th and my granddaughter ' s 4th birthday on august 10th . when is / was your birthday ?
my daughter just had a nice birthday dinner with family . my granddaughter had a couple of parties . what kind of party do you plan on having ?
won ' t you enjoy less chaos ?
the kids can always visit you .
have you ever talked on the phone at movies yourself ?
well its always fun to get the people on their phones thrown out of the movie theater
that ' s awful ! what kind of car do you have ?
those are good cars . i have a volkswagen beetle and i love it !
make a pizza , it is a fail safe choice .
yes , pizza with some olive oil and bal ##sam ##ic vinegar dipping .
did you get hurt or just your car ?
i hope they caught the guy .
i hope it ' s not game of thorns ? ?
i need to look it up , never heard of it .
that is a well trained dog , how did you get it to respond like that . ?
my dog is the worst , always cry ##s , he is pretty young . but i wish he was like your dog .
uh oh , that sounds bad . is it your wife ?
do you know who it is ?
those are always good memories
i agree . no one can ever take those from us
aw that sounds sweet . you ' re wonderful for doing that and i ' m sure you can ' t wait to get there !
i hope everything goes well for you !
what kind , is she alive ?
too bad , is you window broken now ?
did you threw it back into his car ?
unfortunately there are people like that in this world , but maybe they can change someday .
were you happy to see him after that long time ?
seeing the people you love in real life feels always different , i ' m glad you were happy !
yes , i think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood .
same here , cs is just as important as the products we buy .
did you end up reading any reviews on it first ?
well you should take a leap of faith and go in with an open mind .
did you go back ?
that was very nice of him .
great , for what store ?
it ' s rare this days for people to hand make gifts or anything .
why didn ' t you ?
did they get mad at you ?
were you shocked it happened so fast ?
best to block her in every way so you don ' t hear about her life
what happen ##d ? do you have test results pending ?
well what you should do first is be with your family and those who care about you .
cool , where did you go ?
this is a trail where you can walk for months ?
i love coming home too .
i just love relaxing here . my favourite thing is no neighbours !
really ? what was it about ?
that sounds so interesting !
is this your first time ? i know that is something that i would even ever consider . my fear of heights would render me completely lifeless . so are you doing the real sky ##di ##ving or in one of these indoor sky ##di ##ving places ?
well , i am working my way up to taking a flight across the oceans perhaps one where i ' m in a plane in the sky for over 8 hours . outside of that , i will give it to you that you are really brave .
if your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that !
ha ##ha sadly it does not . i still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26 . unless they are very young i don ' t think here really is a good way unless it smells
how what made you feel ? do tell
wow ! ! that sounds horrible ! i can ##t believe she even tried to get your number ! did you give it to her ? ha ##ha ##h
man what happened next , i would have been looking for a place to hide
i bet that was a relief and pretty funny when you look back on it .
that sounds like your job is going well .
i bet you feel really respected and welcome there .
that ' s great for your sister , but you must have felt left out .
did she invite you another year ?
did you have fun when you got to go ?
i guess learning to appreciate positive ##s and get past negative ##s is part of life : )
what instrument do they y ##play ?
oh that ' s great ! you must be very proud .
do you have all your gear ready to go ?
that sounds fun but dangerous at the same time , is it ?
oh no ! you must have been pretty frustrated .
that ' s great that you had someone to help you .
oh yeah ? are you excited ?
that ' s great . i hope you have a wonderful time .
oh no , i bet that is frustrating . have you ever used him before ?
i can ##t stand noisy pipes . i hope he is able to fix it for you .
that ' s a bum ##mer . sorry to hear that but i am sure you can res ##ched ##ule , right ?
i would be to if i were in your shoes . i would be very disappointed too .
awesome , i love pasta .
what did you have ?
lo ##l that sounds wild , did you text them something appropriate ?
hopefully he can take constructive criticism , i think more people should be open to that .
that ' s the worst ! what did you do ?
saved you the money from having to call pop a lock .
aw ##w ##w how sweet . is he your only child ? it does get easier . . . .
i felt the same way when my youngest started school . they grow up so fast .
i just cannot understand why people won ' t do their job properly , i had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work
that is so sad , they don ' t seem to understand workers .
that is nice from you . what card is it ?
why did you do that ?
oh wow , that sounds unfortunate . is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy ?
that sounds terrible . i hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these . if anything i would advise your son to be careful and defend himself .
aw , good on her . i bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel , too . things people do personally themselves always have the better result .
now it ' s your turn ! surprise her with something that will remind her of something special too . people hate to hear it , but our parents are only with us for so long , and when they ' re gone we have so many regrets . use that as a mo ##tiv ##ator
i know that feeling , so frustrating ! do you think there ' s a chance the person will change ?
i ' m sorry ! maybe you could try di ##stan ##cing yourself from this person , you have to protect yourself first .
oh god . . they do that to me too ! and we have poison water ! are they going to fix it ?
oh . . the phone part is the worst ! and being transferred and re - telling the story ! i am glad they reversed it though ! most companies won ' t !
i ' m sorry to hear that . do you have a plan to change things ?
that ' s terrible , but good for you for having a plan . you ' ll get through it , your happiness is the most important thing !
oh that is nice ! why did they move back ?
oh fantastic ! i am sure they are happy to be home .
that happens sometimes but i ' m sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job .
that is good , maybe you can still hang out with them outside of work .
could it be fixed at all ?
i am sorry to hear that but luckily noon ##e got hurt .
how excited are you ? i did not know they still made those .
that is awesome . just in time for the weekend . don ##t forget to get up and stretch every so often .
good friends are in ##val ##ue ##ble .
i know how you feel . . . people also get married and have kids .
was it a slow leak or was it some ##thi ##gn else ?
as long as you have an easy way to fill it up .
that ' s great news ! i find most people are good , honest folk . it ' s the few rotten ones that make us forget that .
that ' s so nice of you . as i said , most people are very nice . you at least now have peace of mind .
wow , did you see a doctor ?
that is good .
do you expect it to be positive ?
if your review is good , could you get a bonus ?
that is good , are you going to have a nap ?
what do you do to relax ?
that ' s great . do you get a bonus ?
that ' s great . what do you sell ?
that must be such a relief to get another semester behind you . it ' s hard waiting to get your grades though i ' m sure .
best wishes to you on your upcoming courses . i have a feeling you will be very successful .
well , it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them .
trust is a hard thing to find , i am so glad you found this bond with this person .
that ' s so annoying . maybe you should leave earlier next time too .
oh
about what /
i am not really a football fan but it is fun to be a part of something !
really ? what did they do to impress you so much ?
wow ! that sounds amazing and complicated ! now i understand why you were positively surprised !
that is great . did you watch all harry potter movies ?
i like also a lot harry potter movies .
did it bring a lot of memories ?
yeah there ' s nothing like the good old days
well , that wasn ' t a very nice thing to do ! think of it as getting a new beard , rather than losing the old friend .
i don ' t think you ' re over ##rea ##cting . that is something important to you and they should have realized that . maybe it ' s time for new friends ?
yeah , i have a few " friends " like that . we hang out now and again , but there are others i ' d rather spend my time with .
that ' s nice of her . what was the occasion ?
ha that ' s nice of her ! well if you haven ' t had your wedding yet , i hope it turns out super nice !
that must be stress ##ful to your friend .
that ' s good that you are content with what you have .
om ##g that must have been really embarrassing . did anyone came to your rescue ?
ha ##ha . i can just imagine you running away .
oh that is so nice ! was it a special o ##cca ##ssion ?
that ' s lovely . i love when people just give small gifts to each other for no reason .
how ##s that working out for you .
i once lost a wallet with a heavy sum ##e of ash in it and i tried to have faith th ##t i would find it or some i trusted would find it and return it back to me .
yes , you were just mentioning it . what happened ?
did you have your wallet returned to you ? if it ' s your relative i think that everything should work out for good .
oh that is so wonderful ! how old is he ?
that ' s so sweet .
that was nice of you . what kind of soup .
that sounds really good !
where did he go ? is he calling you ?
i understand .
that ' s annoying . have you talked to your boss about it ?
that can be tough . hopefully she ' ll understand .
oh that is great ! i have had great success doing ke ##to and fast ##ing for not feeling so hungry ! car ##bs and sugar do me in ! what kind of lunch ##es do you make ?
true ! i don ' t mind the same things . you can do healthy , it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it ta ##sty and healthy
that ' s horrible ! what happened to you ? who stabbed you in the back ?
that ' s really difficult to deal with . when you love someone , you lower your guard for that person and more than anyone else they ' re the ones that can hurt you the most . i hope you find a resolution to your problem .
that sounds interesting , i would love to get a piercing . where will you be getting the piercing ?
dar ##n it ! i have never seen that before , now i am would like to see what it looks like
oh no ! i would be so angry !
that ' s so wrong . id speak to a supervisor
wow , i bet he was really surprised he got to meet him . what did he think of him in person ?
that ' s great . it ' s good to see ce ##le ##bre ##ties be the same in real life as they are on the internet or tv .
oh god , i hate flying . i always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue .
yeah , i will drive almost anywhere rather than fly if i can .
ha ##ha . . i ' m sorry , that made me laugh a little bit . i do that sometimes too , and have no idea how i can forget so many times . i think at least if it happens , almost no one can really tell or notice , if that helps .
well , you could have been going commando , too . and shame on them for not letting you know . let ' s focus on the positive ##s - - you can pull off skinny jeans , and you ' re interesting enough to want to wear superman underwear . keep it up
did the company not pay you well enough ?
well , that was a long time ago , i don ' t think you need to carry it around with you anymore , unless you ' re still doing it .
gross . what did you do ?
i think you could have removed them and still ate it . isn ##t that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes ?
that is amazing ! i bet she had to work hard for that .
that ' s great . i think education is more important than ever
i ' m sorry to hear that , hopefully she naturally mel ##low ##s out .
wow , that doesn ' t sound good . situations like this are hard because you probably don ' t want to off ##end your family and stuff .
how exciting ! i remember when my girls said their first words ! what was his first word do you know ?
yeah , that seems to be what a lot of little ones say for their first word . something about it being easier than ma ma - cong ##rat ##s to the little ty ##ke !
wow , good for her ! i ' m sure she worked really hard to get a degree
i ' m sure she will be able to find a really great job now !
i am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off . just try to be nice to her .
maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate
i don ' t envy you there . i have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before . it ' s nerve rack ##ing .
well , my advice is to give in now , because you probably will in the end anyway and avoid any extra arguing you two would do because of it .
oh no , i am so sorry you have to leave your fur ##ba ##by ! give her lots of extra s ##nu ##ggles and explain to her that you will be back and i am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return ! ! have you ever left her before ?
i believe dogs can understand what you tell them , they understand if we say treat or ride after all lo ##l . maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old ts ##hir ##t you have worn to bed . that may help her to feel more comfortable !
that ' s awesome ! does he have any plans for what he ' s doing after high school ?
that ' s great to hear ! good luck to him !
awesome ! what does his new house look like ?
oh a pool ! ing ##rou ##nd or above ground ?
why did they left half of the trash ?
did you complain to municipality ?
that ' s awful , what was he yelling at you about ?
lo ##l . yeah , been there . even when those guys do that and are wrong they typically never ap ##olo ##gis ##e . they just pretend like they weren ' t acting like a jerk .
ah ##hh ##hh ##hh ##hh ##h ! that is amazing . i am so jealous of you . where are you going ?
where is that ?
have fun ! i ' m sure you will .
ah that ##s so bad . why not raise a complaint
hope it get resolved soon
oh no ! do they have . al ##ost and found ?
i hope you can figure it out soon !
oh nice . is he the type to tone himself down in social settings . . . but he ' s secretly a wi ##z kid
well gotta watch out for him . . . it ' s the quiet una ##ss ##uming ones that are usually full of surprises
i call them h ##yp ##oc ##rites . they take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs . can ' t stand the presence of such people
i knew a couple of people whom i suspected of fitting the description we talked here . and i tried to stay away from them as much as i could
i love dogs , and have three myself . what type of breed is the puppy ?
i have two wiener dogs , and they are both spoiled brat ##s , but i love them . you should be very happy with your girlfriend ' s choice of gifts .
oh no ! what happened ? do you think you did ok anyway ?
that ' s sad to hear : ( that happened to me before and i came out ok in the end , i ' m sure you will too : )
i know how you feel , my brother is my best friend but i only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy . where is your brother now ?
well , i hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit !
oh no ! did it leave a dent ?
i know how you feel . if i had an accident like that i wouldn ##t be able to pay either .
nice ! how ' d you do
that ' s pretty awesome . how much richer are you now
did this happen recently ?
that is good that the person was court ##eous . that may not happen every ##time
i ' m sorry to hear that , was it his fault ?
that ' s good to hear . how did the other person fare ?
are you jealous by this or does it make you angry ?
are you going to be able to purchase the truck for yourself anytime soon ?
true . do you have any plans for the weekend ?
that sounds fun . i love going to the lake its so relaxing .
that is awesome that you have such friendly cow ##or ##kers !
make sure you give each of them a thank you card
did you find out what it was
ha ##ha that ' s pretty funny
i ' m glad you ' re feeling well , it ' s always important to make your health a priority , without our health we have nothing !
you sound very dedicated , that ' s great you ' re so focused on your health , you will age gracefully i ' m sure !
that ' s disgusting . what kind of parent lets their child run around like that .
yeah , really makes you want to touch anything in a store with boo ##ger hands wandering around putting his hands on everything .
sweet ! wouldn ' t mind one myself . what do they cost new ?
wo ##ah ! i could live for ten years on that . hope you wrote down his tag - maybe you could sweet - talk him into going for a drive !
that is really mean . i am sorry .
that is so sad . have you seen or heard from her again ?
do you think she will keep you awake ? how old is she ?
maybe you can hide some of your things , or put them in a safe place .
that is so amazing . animals have an amazing ability to find their way home . i wonder if it was out there having a home ##ward bound style adventure .
that is so great , i ' m glad you got your little friend back .
oh that would kill to see . maybe he will hook you up .
i would be very jealous . don ##t let it get to you too much . at least it doesn ##t seem like you see him all that often .
that ##s awesome . do you look like him ?
that is really nice to have found . i hope you hold onto them in a safe place .
a little homes ##ick ? are you traveling for vacation or for work ?
i understand how you feel . maybe its time to change locations ?
oh my god , that is terrible . has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door ?
i would have as well . i am sorry that happened to you and i hope you can learn to sleep peacefully again .
yes , it ' s important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you
that ' s great to hear ! i hope you will meet your true love soon ! i believe when you do you will now right away . when i met my husband i knew right away he is the one . such a strange feeling . but we ' ve been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other
oh no ! can you ask for an extension ? sometimes they ' ll be quite acc ##om ##mo ##dating .
that seems strange in this day and age . i thought everything could be done online . perhaps you could hand deliver those parts .
good . where are you going ?
i understand . have a good trip . are you traveling alone ?
now that is something i would imagine is hard to deal with . i hope you are in a better place .
you just have to keep working at it .
oh that ' s terrible . i wouldn ' t shut it all out though , you could miss out on someone great .
yeah you are right . better to take things slow and figure out what they are all about first .
that ' s really kind of you . not everyone can or will do that . i do hope she pays you back !
i ' m sure ! it ' s always nice to help someone in need , but you do hope they ' ll do the right thing by you when possible .
you ' re obviously a very good person and i ' m sure your friend knows that - she ' ll repay you when she can .
then you ' ll be fine : )
that ' s pretty heavy . i hope that doesn ' t discourage you from trying again in the future , especially with a rescue dog or something in that area . if you don ' t mind me asking , what happened ?
i had never heard of that before . that sounds like tragic timing . and you ' re right , i probably shouldn ' t have brought up getting another one so soon , it just sounded like you ' d be a good owner , since you seem like you care so much . it makes sense for you to not rush right back into it .
that is so great that he was able to go . i had the same problem as you , but i started at community college when i was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when i was 32 . it is never too late for you to go .
they are the best . i think it is good to go later , because you know what you want more and don ' t waste time and money .
awesome . is it the first im ##e ?
maybe you will a friend soon . or even meet a nice guy .
that ' s horrible . is it treat ##able ?
i ' m praying that she will be fully healed , and that you will take good care of her .
everyone in life has problems , do not feel bad for sharing yours i hope it gets better for you .
you are welcome , i am glad i can put you in a better mood .
that ' s fantastic ! it must be a good day for you .
i ' m sure you were pretty nervous after you applied .
a little anxious ? have you ever flown on a plane before ?
i ' m sure you ' ll be fine . statistical ##ly its safer than driving .
that sounds cool . do you go fishing a lot ?
my dad really enjoyed fishing . i think i ' d like the peace and quiet of it .
how awesome ! she must be proud of herself ! where does she work ?
it isn ' t easy to be successfully self - employed but she did it !
that is awesome , how long have you been playing ?
have you thought about getting back into it ?
awesome ! do you think did well ?
nice , what job did you apply for ?
these people are not people you see everyday . i wouldn ##t worry about it
watch some youtube videos of other peoples mis ##fort ##unes so you can forget about yours quickly !
why would anyone make a party in a shady area ? was it your friend ' s party ?
probably it is just the theme of his party . he wanted to have some fun in the form of cautious excitement
awe . that is soo sweet . you have some really good friends
that is really nice to have . most people don ' t even have one good friend .
that is really such a pain , i remember when i had to do my paperwork for school it is not fu ##m
well i really wish you very good luck with all that
that is so nice what kind was it ?
that sounds so good i love coconut rum that would have made my birthday awesome i ' m glad you enjoyed it .
that would make me jealous . do they let you ride in it or any ##thi ##gn ?
i understand . that sounds frustrating
i am sorry to hear that . why didn ' t you get the promotion ?
it shouldn ' t be based off the senior ##ity . it should be based off skill and if you had the skill you should have gotten it .
how did the first day go ?
oh that stink ##s
what happens next week ?
i bet that is exciting then . are they happy too ?
oh no why is that ?
i can see how that can be annoying . have you talked to him about his drinking ?
aw man ! that stink ##s ! i never really win things . some people have all the luck .
i would be so jealous too ! sorry you didn ' t win . keep trying !
wow she must be extremely smart for her age . that is incredible .
i would be so proud of her . im sure it will carry through the rest of her schooling .
it ' s really tough , isn ' t it ? i ' m just getting to the end of that with my wife , she ' s almost back . what are you going to do with your time ?
that ' s always good . at least you have something to do . it ' ll be over in no time !
dan ##g ! that stink ##s . im sorry . did they just leave without saying something ?
oh wow ! im sorry about that
that is annoying , did you contact the bank to report it stolen ?
that is frustrating , maybe you should switch banks and keep separate accounts , or use a credit card instead .
that is un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly frustrating . i know exactly what you mean . what rules do they not respect ?
unbelievable ! those are pretty simple rules to follow . what are you going to do now ?
that ##s good . how was it ?
well , that ' s always good to hear . i am glad
i am so sorry to hear that . what happened ?
that is so awful . i just hate to hear that . how old was he ?
your car door ? that ' s awful - did they at least leave you a note so you could contact them ?
disgusting . did you contact the police ? wal ##mart ##s have surveillance cameras in their parking lots . perhaps they could find the cu ##lp ##rit that way .
what ' s happening ?
oh yeah ! mine started this week . its been great . ha ha
what ##s wrong ? just an older woman ?
oh i hope she starts feeling better soon !
you must be nervous . what ' s the speech about ?
do you give those speeches often ?
it the trash can damaged ?
that is so messed up .
how many years has it been since you seen your friend from school ?
20 years is a long time to recall fun times .
i am glad to hear it . you must be quite content at this moment .
enjoy this moment , and try not to think about the bad that has happened .
that ##s the worst , is it a big dog or little dog ?
exactly ! wow maybe you need to get some sort of bark device that stops them from barking !
uh oh ! what happen ##d ?
oh no ! have you found him yet ?
are you currently working ?
wow that was mighty nice of them
i am sorry to hear that . but at ##lea ##st they are having fun
you should plan a surprise dinner for them and make their favorite dishes .
oh ##hh , disgusting . did you say something to the flight attendants ?
i can ' t blame you , i know i sure wouldn ' t .
i am just like you . i have road rage . i don ##t know what it is .
same . i usually speed up to another car in another lane and just go the same speed as them . it makes it feel so good to see the other person pissed
lo ##l that is so funny how did you do that was anyone around ?
well at least you wasn ' t the only one next time double check for everything before hitting the shower .
hopefully not ! sounds like you are at ##lea ##st seeing a doctor which is good ! i hope you feel better asa ##p .
: ( well i will pray that everything comes back good .
that ' s horrible ! i would be too ! i have an older brother and have been right where you are . what are you going to do ?
yeah , make him sq ##ui ##rm . he had better apologize .
oh no ! what was it and what will you do ?
that would make me so mad !
oh no , what happened ?
did you find out who ?
cong ##rat ##s , what are you having ?
wow that is great , good luck , your gonna need it with twins !
what happened ?
oh no ! is he okay ?
really ? that ##s so good for you . i also just started doing a little work out in the mornings . how long do you run for ?
good for you keep it up . you will get there in no time .
oh ? what did you end up doing with them ?
that is pretty fun to do . i used to do that when i was in college with my family .
i can imagine . just be cool and do as you have been taught !
yes just have faith in yourself and your abilities !
oh ! that ' s so nice isn ' t it ? where were you coming home from ?
yes , i felt the same way when i went visit my dad up north . he is a great cook . i bet your mom is .

that is great are they home school ?
that is great you will teach and see your kids grow and because of you that is awesome .
yeah that makes me mad too
that is pretty disgusting
damn that sucks , been there , my husband had an affair .
did you end up taking her back ?

wow that ##s a good split , what are you going to do with your 10 percent ?
i would have been as well we all need va ##cas , anywhere special to go ?
sounds like a solid plan , you should go for it ! shoot for the moon .
sorry to hear about that . but i am glad to hear he ' s doing better now !
yep , genetic testing tech is really amazing . a life - save ##r in many cases !
oh man i would file a lawsuit ##tt ##tt ##tt ##t
right , everyone needs a lawyer in their family , im trying to get my little brother to be one lo ##l
oh my , i think you should stock up on vitamin c and hydra ##te yourself just in case .
i agree , hot chicken soup is the way to go . i hope its just the weather and not a cold
i can understand , i ' m sure it has sentimental value .
i would probably keep it if i were you , more sentimental value than cash value anyway .
i remember those . the light up ones were the cool ##est .
thank goodness ! a pleasant change from fi ##dget spin ##ners and fort ##ni ##te .
that is very nice of you . you two must be really good friends .
you are very trusting . its nice to have a friend like you . im sure she appreciate ##s it .
i would have been too ! do you always take it to work ?
i get it me too i like my own personal space .
that is heart breaking ! my pit ##bu ##ll died a year ago and i still miss him like crazy .
you too . animals are just the best
oh , how amazing ! so cute seeing kitten ##s jump ! what kind of kitten do you have ?
beautiful !
i would be too ! were you stuck working late ?
u ##gh that is just the worst .
how did you get better ?
oh that is good that you had the time
that was rude of them . why ?
wow , i would go over and talk to that boss and demand an apology
what ' s going on next week ?
ya ##y ! that is one of the best days of the year !
what was the issue that needed fixing ?
well it looks like they fixed it !
i know how you feel . i have not seen mine as well as we all live so far away
yep , i hardly talk to them . even less to my dad .
oh scary ! what happened ?
pe ##sky kit ##ties !
it is to me . i don ##t know how people do it
ha ##ha ##ha , same ! if i took time though i could probably learn how to
it is the best i once went to italy and the food over there is great
i went to rome the food over there is great
how did that happen ? i hope it wasn ' t a case of break - in and entering .
understand ##ably so . who doesn ' t clean up after themselves ?
you must have been very hopeful about your prospects !
i am happy for you that you are pursuing your passion .
i know the feeling . i lived far away from my parents in college . it does get better .
i had to try to make friends and see my parents when i could . i wish you luck .
wow that must be awful .
that ' s fair . space is good
i bet that made quite a mess
i feel the same way with my dog sometimes . always making a mess
flies are the most annoying bugs to have in the house . finally did you get rid of it ?
let ' s hope no more flies infiltrate your home !
i hate working when it rains hard .
i guess so , where do you work ?
that ' s so nice ! does he enjoy playing team sports ?
ha ##ha , well it ' s good for kids to social ##ize when they are younger .
don ##t bee nervous about it panic only makes it worst how are you handling it ?
well i really wish you the best and hope everything goes well
i don ' t blame you . i don ' t have a sister but i wouldn ' t want my things taken .
i would need them to replace it . you don ' t break a bunch of my stuff with no ram ##ification ##s .
did you have them set up for a while like decor ?
that ##s really a bum ##mer then , i hope you can get them back together .
i ' m guessing it didn ' t work right ?
sounds to me like you ' ve made some good decisions in your life to land you in marriage , awesome !
that would be a nice surprise , now you need not go buy any hang ##ers
now you can take care of your close in your closet without spending any extra money . you saved time and money .
that ' s always fun ! what book was it ?
interesting , i ' ve never read it before . i will have to check it out !
oh wow ! did you accept the candy ?
usually humans are really good at sniffing out weird ##ness like that . glad you didn ' t take it !
oh no ! how did that happen ? ?
lo ##l , that could happen to the best of us . hopefully it you were able to put it behind you quickly and didn ##t let it ruin your night !
i ' m so so sorry to hear that , it can ' t be easy being in that position . have you spoken to anyone close to you about it ?
definitely . not to make this about me , but i ' ve had a lot of issues in my life that simply got worse over time because i kept it to myself .
yeah , that ' s always fun ! did you get a lot of money back ?
that ' s no fun . i once had to pay in about a $ 1000 so count yourself lucky !
it is crazy how long it takes to get everything un ##pack ##ed in a new house . are you loving the new place ?
congratulations on the new place !
i ' m sorry to hear that . i understand they can live a really long time . was it an old parrot ?
that ' s sad to hear . i ' m sure he lives a great life none the less .
that ##s always a really hard thing . you ##ll have a good time though
iv ##e been there . but get out there and meet some new people . go get drunk and go to a party
oh my , i would have been shocked . wow did you react to finding this ?
yes maybe it was for the best time . hopefully you will someone better .
wow , that ' s so caring and lovely ! you must enjoy it a lot .
i ' ve never volunteered for an animal shelter but i would like to get into it once i have more time on my hands . i love animals .
how much does the damage cost ?
are you un ##ins ##ured ?
what ##s the point of having an insurance company if you can ' t use it ?
why was that ?
that ' s pretty bleak . sorry to hear that .
well i hope he cleared it up - that is not a nice thing to wake up to !
i would pick it up and throw it all over his yard ! but then i ' m a little on the vin ##dict ##ive side , lo ##l !
i ' ve had that feeling as well , especially if it is with someone that is close to me . is it because you don ##t like confrontation or a different reason ?
i used to have social anxiety as well . i don ##t recall the names off the top of my head but some self help books with the topic have helped me in the past !
i used to be that way too . one thing to think about that might help is even if you do look stupid for a second nobody is going to remember 10 minutes from then . another thing that helped me was thinking about how good it felt if a stranger started talking with me in public for a 2 - 5 minute conversation and how it didn ##t upset me or make them look stupid so i shouldn ##t look stupid if i did the same thing .
oh really , do you feel like you did a great job ?
that ##s good , it must be re ##lie ##ving to feel so confident .
oh ye ##a . . what ##s that ?
oh nice . where can i find it ? netflix ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . how long were you together ?
did you do something to cause the breakup ?
oh no ! that ' s a lot of money . did you get any of it back ?
doesn ' t give anyone the right to steal it , tho ' . i ' m so sorry - how awful for you . i hope they had a horrible time when they tried to spend it !
oh gee ##z , stay safe ! tornadoes are one of those weird things for me . they sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside i love going out to see what ##s happening .
ha ##ha ##ha , i don ##t know if people today would rather lose electricity or get a tornado . either way i hope you stay safe and if a tornado does come you don ##t take any damage !
it is important to have a focus on something positive .
nothing in life is certain , the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you .
that must mean they think you ' re a pretty cool person ! people usually don ' t go through that kind of effort unless they think you ' re worth it and deserve it . so , ku ##dos to you for having that kind of effect on others !
oh , you don ' t work with them anymore ? or maybe it was because you decided to be a stay - at - home mother ?
you may need to go to the barber shop !
the barber shop is totally worth it . they do such a good job .
that ' s terrible ! i hope it didn ' t end up inside them ?
okay well that ' s good at least . i hope you find it soon !
well that was rude , did you confront him ?
i would ask him how it went and casually say " i would have gone had you asked " .
that ' s awesome ! you ' re really lucky .
i ' m sure it took a lot of hard work to get to that point !
oh man ! that sucks ! did anyone happen to see it ?
i am sorry you have to deal with that . what a pain !
congratulations ! that sounds like a lot of great news in one month !
i really hope it does . just stay positive !
what did you find out ? ?
oh wow , are you excited ? ? i would assume so if you agreed to go on a date . i hope you guys have a great time !
i ' m so curious . what happened at church ?
oh little mistakes like that happen , it ' s no big deal !
you hate it when what happens ?
oh yeah , that it the worst . were you able to wash it out at least ?
i get really anxious too . what are you having surgery on ?
i ' ve had that done before . the waking up with ga ##uze in your mouth is the worst part .
did it bring back a lot of memories ?
yeah there ' s nothing like the good old days
good for you . how is it going ?
pretty good here - just a homes ##cho ##olin ##g mom of 2 trying to get some laundry done . i ' m glad you are on the path you want to be on !
was it good ?
lo ##l i love a good jason stat ##ham movie
what made you blush so hard ?
hey you have got to do what you have got to do . hopefully next time you ' re closer to home when you need to go .
did you watch it late at night ? i rarely watch scary movies .
i don ##t blame you . you are going to have to watch them during the day next time .
that sounds exciting !
how old is your nephew ?
yeah , glasses suck but , so does not being able to see . good that your class mates are nice people .
yep , i ' ve got terrible eyes . i know what you mean .
oh well that would have been embarrassing , but if you were trying to shed a few pounds i would say your doing a great job !
go buy you some new s ##na ##zzy belts ! ha ##ha !
what kind of job is it ?
that ##s interesting !
i know how you feel . what helped me was getting a bicycle and get out in the sun for some exercise .
i feel you . well it sounds like you keep yourself busy with a hobby at least .
that is really something to be thankful for . i have lost 2 . . . so for sure !
it ' s okay ! life happens ! cher ##ish your babies always : )
where did you go shopping ?
i love the th ##rift stores . i can spend hours in there .
i buy a lot of kids clothes from there . i also go to a salvage store called dirt cheap , great deals !
sounds like a cool goodwill .
do you feel like you are prepared ?
well make sure you get a good nights rest , sleep is just as important .
wow that ##s horrible . i hate the way they make the system to steal money
maybe it might be worth trying again now , with another doctor ?
i saw it when i was much older but my parents didn ' t let me watch it when i was young . i bet . that wouldn ' t be like real life for really being left home alone .
i forgot about that part ! yes ! terrifying ! hope you didn ' t have too many nightmares over it .
i didn ##t have an interview . did you ?
i hope you get it too . good ##lu ##ck
wow ! did she say yes ?
sorry to hear that . are you breaking up with her ?
oh no , i ' m sorry . what went badly ? one things or just lots of little things ?
i completely get it . hope things are better tomorrow !
oh fantastic ! what did you guys do ?
by her you mean wife ?
that ' s so embarrassing , but hey everyone has those moments once in a while .
good idea ! and if ever you go back , just take it slow and easy .
that ' s sad , bad memories ?
yeah i understand you , but people change and we learn from them and that helps us grow more , don ' t take it too personally
oh good luck man ! hopefully everything works out !
we can only hope so ! get her some flowers !
hm , that ##s not good . how so , if i may ask ?
sounds like quite a problem ! i think you should try different foods and narrow down which ones trouble you .
what ? do live in california ?
that is so awful ! did you have insurance ? ?
he sounds like he got really lucky . i ' d be pretty jealous of him if i were you .
well , that ' s not a very friend like thing to do .
that ' s amazing , what test was it ?
algebra ? wow i love math ##s , that sounds great i am so happy
oh no , what did you do ?
oh no ! does he know you did it or did you never tell him ? yeah , we all have things we regret , its how we move forward and resolve the situation that matters .
wow that must of been such a great surprise .
dan ##g he should clean my house too then while i am gone .
no way ! cong ##rat ##s ! ! ! i bet you feel really excited . how long had you been developing it ?
i bet , 4 years is a long time to work on a project too . i may not know you but as someone who had once wanted to get into development , i feel really proud for you . that is a huge accomplishment ! cong ##rat ##s again !
ha ##ha ! i hear you ! it helps if you have more money to save too !
lo ##l ! well that would be great . give me some of that luck ! ; )
where are yours and what ' s going on with ##the ##m ?
so sorry to hear that . . . wish you blessings and health and peace
that was so nice of her i bet you was so happy you much be very special to her
one day i wanted a rabbit and my mom got me one she told me not to feed it food and i gave it house food and it die lo ##l
i guess neither do i , sorry to hear about your rabbit though .
yes its a good lesson for you , hopefully you don ##t repeat it !
your a pretty tough guy and you have the wits too dude . you got this .
like i said you got this and going in with a positive mine you might as well take the world while your at it .
aw ##w , that ' s sweet . i love animals ! they love you un ##con ##ditional ##ly .
uh oh , someone ' s in trouble ! it ' s funny how smart dogs can be sometimes . they were trying to butter you up before you saw what they did !
oh no i hope you didn ' t spend much on it
that ' s such a shame ! i always hate getting let down
aw you must have felt really nos ##tal ##gic in that moment . sounds like a great memory .
i would highly suggest you do . mom ##s deserve all the love .
u ##gh hate when that happens . . . do you live alone or with roommate ##s
man i would ##a smacked him on the head . . . lo ##l rotting food / dirty dishes are the worst
how did it go ?
i hope it does .
wow , that ##s horrible . what were they stealing ?
that ##s horrible . im glad they got caught
that ' s cool . sounds like you ' re an animal person
if you could . . would you get a cat or a dog
i agree , but maybe you should be a little less aggressive
i don ##t know , i just wouldn ##t be that aggressive . i ' d still try to protect her though
oh im sorry to hear that , what caused this ?
no one deserves this , this is the worst thing that can ever happen , im sorry to hear that
that ' s fantastic , you must feel really confident in your ability .
do you receive feedback often ?
that must have been nos ##tal ##gic . when did you last pick one up ?
what a beautiful game , hey ?
oh no ! was it expensive items ?
that is so awful . i am so sad that happened to you .
interesting ! i could see how you thought that . just because they ' re homeless and have fallen on hard times doesn ' t mean they ' re dumb . but yeah , there ' s a good chance they did something wrong to be in that pre ##dic ##ament , so their judgment could be questionable .
you ' re right , sorry for putting words in your mouth . and yeah , i don ' t know how to engage with them either . as a college student , there are plenty that kind of stalk the campus and ask for spare change . but i have little spending money , so i always have to turn them down
ha ##ha i " m terrible with names too . but for me there are only 2 types of people : ones that are memorable and ones that are boring and if you ' re boring i definitely won ' t remember who the hell you are
that ' s good . don ' t be so hard on yourself . people should be begging for your attention . not the other way around ; )
that is very lucky ! did you see who dropped it ?
oh wow ! lucky you !
is everything going perfectly ?
that ' s good !
i get that ! what show is it ?
i have never heard of it , i did watch the movie though . it would have been cool if they got jennifer garner and ben afl ##eck in it
oh no ! was anything taken ?
you ' re very lucky !
we all have weeks like that . don ' t be too hard on yourself . everything will get done eventually .
that must be hard , i ' m sorry . just do what you can though . i would help if i could .
that ##s great . im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one .
i bet . the grass has been growing so fast right now . your yard is going to look great again .
oh my goodness ! 3 months ? ! where are you going ?
that is amazing ! what places do you want to visit the most ?
that sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated !
everyone needs some way to keep them going !
what kind of job ?
well confidence is key so i bet you will get the job : )
oh no , how did it happen ? were you in a hurry ?
this is the worst , i can understand why you are mad , i ' d be the same as you , ar ##gh im sorry
oh my , that is tragic . i hope you are there to support him .
good of you . times like these can be tough and he needs all the support he can get .
that is pretty hard my dude . but join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area .
also try joining a club you might end up in apartment with someone next year instead of the cramped dorm ##s .
do you trust other people at all ? it seems like it would be hard to trust someone if you think only you can know what is best for you .
that ##s great . it seems like you turned your life around . it just seems like it would get lonely not being able to trust anyone .
how big is it ?
ah . . well i guess its not that bad yet
did you think a bear was going to eat you ?
had you forgotten your pepper spray ?
oh wow , this is my passion too , which eu country are you going to start first ?
i have , and i plan to travel the world in 1 - 2 years with my wife , spain is amazing , you ' re going to enjoy yourself i wish you the best
well at ##lea ##st when you finish you can pop a beer and enjoy your hard work
ha ##ha ##ha yeah or go to a nice restaurant to feel relaxed after all that hard work
as reunion ##s go i guess . how was it crazy ?
oh wow , bet you felt guilty saying no !
good for you . we only get one body , gotta take care of it best we can !
yeah there ' s no escaping things that humans have chemical ##ly altered , and we consistently put in our bodies .
lo ##l . well then dar ##ni ##t i want to be a unicorn .
lo ##l - well that ' s true . dar ##n all those people who stopped me from being a unicorn . well how on earth did you get back to earth then ?
or unlikely ; )
i am sorry to hear that . unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer . is it treat ##able ?
oh my . i have been in that situation before . you have my sy ##mp ##athi ##es .
that sounds terrifying ! i wouldn ' t want to stay alone either . that was nice you guys took her in .
i don ' t blame her . i am sure she felt more at ease staying with you guys .
that is not good , why did you miss your son ' s game ?
well if it is work then it is ok because you have to put food on the table first i can relate to that
did you try to pick her up and take her outside ?
you should try and use a toy or something to get her to chase dogs love those .
why do you say used to be your favorite rest ##uer ##au ##nt ?
wow . . that really stink ##s that that happened to your favorite rest ##era ##unt
oh no ! that is horrible ! did you get it back ?
that must be so stress ##ful . i am sorry .
that ' s cool , was it nos ##tal ##gic ?
yeah , it ' s crazy to think how long ago some things are
oh no that ##s horrible . im glad i didn ##t see that , i would ##ve been so upset
ye ##a that ##s what i was thinking too . poor dogg ##y : (
what time was it ? please be ##care ##ful with these kinds of things , you were lucky and i am glad nothing happen ##d , but people don ' t realise how dangerous it is at night , why were you out so late ?
please be ##care ##ful my friend had his phone stolen recently because of the same thing
that sounds wonderful ! i bet it was amazing
wow ! i wish i could see something like that
that is very disgusting . i hope you complained !
that is nice . sometimes things like this do happen , but it is not something you like to see !
oh im so sorry , please don ' t worry , i know it ' s tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end
just like birth , death is the start of another process unclear to us , the unseen , and i believe in this deeply , your mother is fine , she is always there
aw ##w , im sorry . that ##s always hard
i hope you are able to make some new friends . or keep in touch with video calls
a road trip sounds fun , but i agree with you . i feel like i am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all .
yeah can you take turns driving ?
good luck with that , its rough out there .
i hear ya . perhaps they will though ? gotta stay positive .
that could be embarrassing , do you have a new partner ?
oh no , let ' s hope she ' s up for some action with another girl .
did he finish it all ?
what did the shirt look like ?
oh god that ' s worse than thinking you lost your phone for a second , i am aware of the feeling , how are you feeling now
what did you learn ?
did you try to find who the $ 20 belonged to ?
i would feel guilty keeping money that i did not earn or that was not mine . maybe you could give the $ 20 to charity ?
dan ##g , that ' s a nice honor . shows you what he thinks of you . i would like someone to ask me to be their best man one day ! congratulations to the both of you
oh yeah , i forgot that ' s one of your responsibilities ! well , you know your brother best , so i ' m sure you ' ll know what to do . but if you think he won ' t like the typical drunken de ##bau ##cher ##y strip ##per party , don ' t do it just because it ' s the thing everyone does . when my brother had his wedding , we just sat around and played video games
well its good that you are helping out your friend . i ' m sure he appreciate ##s it .
it ' s good that you are making an effort . that ' s more than a lot of people do .
oh welcome to the long distance club ! i am exactly in the same situation as you , we are going on a cable car , we are going to meet in 2 weeks and i also can ' t wait , i feel you , let ' s have a blast
yu ##p i totally get you , it ' s same here and now it feels time is going super slow , these next 2 weeks are going to be hell before i go to see her , make sure you enjoy yourself !
what happened ?
oh no ! that ' s sad
why was it amazing ?
ah that ##s cool then
that ##s really sad . im sorry to hear that . getting old stink ##s . i feel bad when i see someone who seems really lonely
ye ##a that ##s hard . you can ##t do anything now , but maybe there ##s another neighbor that you can get close too
that really is something to get excited about ! i ' ve never been outside of the country , so i ' m jealous of people that get the chance to . i hope you ' re able to get everything out of the trip that you want to
if i were you , i ' d be the same way , just counting down the days . i hope your travel goes smoothly . if you ' re going with someone special , i hope you guys both enjoy your time there
that sounds really annoying , i bet that ##s making a huge mess
ye ##a train her to push the stuff into the garbage can
sorry to hear that . maybe your luck will turn around soon !
i hope you weren ' t too jealous of him ! i hope you win next time .
well if he was good at the trick its understand ##able . as long as you were a kid .
wow , you better let someone else do your due dil ##igen ##ce you might fall victims to sc ##am ##mers .
must be disappointing knowing the spark isn ' t there .
i guess , as long as you are happy enough .
im happy to hear that ! that is a big step and he needs as much support as possible !
i bet he feels so good about that , its amazing to watch a big milestone !
that stink ##s i ' m sorry .
our weather has been so extreme this year . its scary .
that ' s awesome ! what did they do ?
that is really cool ! you have some really great cow ##or ##kers !
that ' s good ! always smart to be prepared !
yeah , i always make sure to have things like band - aids or tape with me in case of emergencies .
good for you , how did it turn out ?
at least you tried , there are plenty of fish in the sea . don ' t give up .
that sucks , perhaps he should of be saving his money to pay for his apartment , instead of having two dogs .
well that was nice of you , glad you took the dogs in .
that sounds very de ##pressing .
you will for sure be next if it stays like that .
have you gone to a doctor about it yet ?
well would you rather have it creep up on you out of the blue ?
that sucks , i imagine nothing ever became familiar to you .
yeah , a bit like how my employment goes .
oh my goodness . what did you do ? are you alright ?
i would have pulled into a public place or police station . i ' m so sorry that happened to you but glad you are ok .
do they live far away from you ?
wow that is far . i hope you guys use video chat ##s
uh ##oh . i hope it was ok .
e ##w ##w ##w that ##s so gross . i hope you didn ##t have to clean it up
that is awesome . stay positive i hope things will work out .
i ' m so glad . marriage is tough but when you love each other it ' s work the effort .
oh really did you meet them from tin ##der
try not to scare them away , could be your last shot at love .
how did you celebrate after ?
what ' s your favorite alcohol to drink ?
that is pretty awesome my dude .
man that would of been cool but thinking about that was cool .
did he get soaked ?
that ' s good
that ' s so cool ! i would love to have a car like that !
yeah , i feel like we are living in a science fiction movie sometimes !
that ##s so nice of them ! did you enjoy it ?
i agree , they must really love you a lot
well did people help you get cleaned off .
hopefully you didn ' t miss the best part of the fair . that would be un ##lu ##cky
i love when that happens ! i did the same thing not too long ago when i was in the area i grew up in .
yu ##p ! it really makes you appreciate life !
oh my , i hope it was only a sincere error and not the charge ##r being malicious
u ##gh that must be so ag ##gra ##vating that you can ' t even get your money back . i would suggest calling and telling the manager .
oh my , why on earth did you do that ?
as you should , spitting in food is never the right answer . hopefully you learned something from this .
oh really ? did you go check it out ?
yeah i think i would have felt the same !
why inspired you to do that ?
i suppose if any car should be fit for such a task , it would be a tesla .
sorry to hear that ! it must be in ##fur ##iating to have that happen
neither would i . hopefully , the other person is paying up for the damage at least
that is awesome . where is your " home " ?
that is amazing . my mom never really cooked for us but she was a great mom . i bet you miss home .
what are they making you feel like ?
wow , that seems bad . why are you taking them ?
oh really , did you prepare it yourself .
well good thing you listened
that must have frightened you . was it the beef jerk ##y sas ##qua ##tch ?

its definitely not fair . it seems almost as if people do not try to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain ( plans ) per friends are better , and then make a choice
yes , true friends understand and will work around your schedule and won ' t put you off , or make you feel like you have done something wrong .

that ' s a good attitude to have ! stay strong !
i would never be able to do that !
stay on the ground my friend .
that ' s great ! what do you have planned ?
that does sound like a lot of fun !
that had to be a weird feeling . how was it ?
i can imagine . iv ##e never been back to mine , but i can still picture in my mind what it looks like
uh oh ! i would hate that
that ' s always got to be the worst thing to deal with
oh yeah ? what is the exam for ? i hope you do well .

that ##s awesome . make sure you wear suns ##creen . don ##t want to get burned
i need some time off of work too . maybe i should take a vacation !
uh oh . a little too much to drink ?
that is about as bad as it can get right there . i think you might have to tell her . the guilt will eat you alive .
wow he must have been hungry as hell .
oh it was one of those cha ##len ##ges things ?
how are you doing now ?
ye ##a that ##s good though that you are moving forward

are you jealous of them ?
that sucks , i just had a massive meal myself .
hopefully you do well with it !
you will get in and do great things !
oh ##no , what did you have ? what was bad about it ?
e ##w ##w ##w that sounds disgusting . i would have complained
that was really nice of you . did you find it ?
well keep looking and maybe check the local animal shelters if you haven ' t already .
that ' s pretty compassionate of you !
do you have any pets of your own ? you sound like an animal person
good times indeed ! those were the days . it seems cl ##iche to say they were simpler times because i remember them saying that back then about when they were younger . history repeats itself .
when i think of christmas with families i tend to think about national lamp ##oon ' s christmas vacation . a classic .
how come ? is everything alright ?
that would be great . i ' m hoping all goes well with you .
i hope everything goes well ! what are you worried about ?
well i hope that it is nothing serious .
that ' s great !
i hope he does !

maybe you can pay it forward next time you see someone buying a drink .
why was that ?
are you sure they were werewolves and not regular wolves ?
when is the beat down scheduled for and how can i help ?
no no , we need revenge . think about it and let me know
i think that way too !
if you expect the worst , you won ' t be disappointed .
hate when that happens . . . if it happens more than once you can file a complaint with the city council
or next time stand in the garbage ##man ' s way at your neighbor ' s to confront him about it ha ##ha
who ? is everything alright ?
oh my goodness i ' m so sorry . i really hope she comes back soon
do you have a plan made up ?
i think you can do this , i ' m proud of you .

i know . the news said it was 100 % but nothing so far .
it cool things off a little bit too . we could use it .
were you in bed with your roommate ?

you sound like you ' d be a good therapist .
it ' s been to be humble than rude or mean , that ' s my motto .
that ' s great that you had such a good time . you sound like a good parent !
that really is . when i comes down to it what a kid wants most from a parent is love .

what kind of cheese ##cake are you thinking of eating ?
oh no . what ##s wrong ? why are you going ?

yes , at least you have those memories of her to cher ##ish and hold forever .
i get that , but money talks at the end of the day
that is what it comes down to sometimes !
that is always tough to deal with . time can help , but it can ' t get you over the loss of a loved one .
i agree . things can always get better , just remember her and honor her the best that you can .
i can imagine so ! i bet you are one tired person when you hit the bed at night !

i didn ' t even know that was a thing . im sorry
uh i ' ve heard way too many people experience that . why don ' t people just not hit you in the first place , if they don ' t want to take responsibility ?
i really wish those people who get fined just like those traffic cameras that send you tickets in the mail for speeding . it would really reduce hit and runs .

wow , your dog is that cat ' s hero !
i bet your dog is pretty smart . i mean she was able to notice a cat in danger and helped out and all .
i don ' t understand why people just don ' t break up . why cheat ?

it will happen eventually . enjoy being single while you can .
it will come to you when you least expect it ! until then enjoy yourself !

i hope it isn ' t too expensive to have repaired .
ye ##a ? how ' d it go ?

that ' s awesome . when will you get your results ?
have you started ?
man . i should start , too .
that is a good friend , but i ' m sorry you tore your pants . why were you climbing a fence ?
well , at least your friend was there to help you out . maybe you should have picked up a sewing kit at the grocery store to try to fix the jeans also - lo ##l !
what do you plan on doing while you ' re alone ?
you are an inspiration to me . i need to hit the gym .
oh no . what happened ?
lo ##l is he younger or older ?

yes it is ! that ##s sounds disappointing , but im glad you found a new place you will hopefully like .
yi ##kes , maybe it ' s time to switch banks
o ##of , are they even allowed to do something like that ?
that is bad . you should have immediately gotten a towel and dry yourself . you could get sick
did you spend the whole day with wet clothes at work ? didn ' t the manager allow you to go home and change ?
i hope you studied for it !
that ' s great ! i hope you do well on your exam ! reward yourself after too
well , i think that all depends on where you ' re eating and how much you eat . do you think you ' re eating anywhere un ##hea ##lth ##y ?
mine too . whenever i go , i tend to get 10 happy meals . gotta get all those toys !
oh god . did any ##ting get stuck on your car ?

i know it can be upset ##ting and emotional , but im sure you are happy !
ha ##ha that ' s awesome ! cong ##rat ##s to him !
lo ##l they sure do ! do they have any babies yet ?
oh ye ##a ? where ya headed ?
the beach is awesome . have fun !
what things are you wanting to go as planned ?
very true , i am sure those instructions are forth coming . he wouldn ' t leave us hanging .
i can ' t even imagine what would make them ban certain dogs to begin with
i ' ve heard that fear makes people do all sorts of crazy things .
i admire people who can care for dogs , i can barely take care of myself !
i was only 18 when my daughter was born , had no idea what i was getting into ! ! !
does he get anything else ?
o ##oo ##h , that doesn ' t sound great , but at least he ' s not causing any trouble . it ' s hot outside , everyone needs some clean water
hmm . . i think we ' ve all been there one time or another . are you going to admit it ?
well you certainly don ' t want that hanging over your head for the rest of your life . it sounds like you have a good moral outlook on life , i think you have to admit it .
oh no ! why did you cancel ? that ' s the best time to go !
that ' s a really good reason to do so . wouldn ' t want his mom getting any sick ##er with no one around .
you should go for it ! how long have you known her ?
that ' s cute , you guys will be very happy together i think
you should totally go !
if there ' s a time to treat yourself , it ' s definitely on your birthday !
im so sorry ! i bet your very sad right now !
im sorry to hear this . times like this can be terrifying , but you can get through it .
why did you decide to tell your mom you washed it ?
that ' s okay , sometimes little white lies like that won ' t harm anyone !
oh my god , that ' s so sad to hear . how is he holding up ?
aw , cheer up , friend . it ' s rough now , but it will get better ! maybe you two should go to the pet store to try and find a new dog for him !
me either , so rude ! it happens too often .
yeah people who do that have zero self awareness . : /
that ' s so great ! you guys have been able to stay close after so long ! you must be very compatible with each other
amazing ! i wish i had some friends like that in my life
are you excited ?
i know what you mean ! i ' ve been homes ##cho ##olin ##g my girls forever it seems and my oldest graduates this spring . i ' m ready to be done with school too - lo ##l !
oh no . how long will he be away for ?
maybe you can get him on sky ##pe or something ?
oh no ! did you look in the places you ' ve been all day ?
that ' s so sad . i hope your spouse won ' t be too upset with you .
do you pull it up ?
that wouldn ' t be good .
were you in a tight spot ? how much did you borrow ?
what a good friend to lend you money in your time of need . you should thank him and take him to dinner after everything is sorted .
did you perform well ?
don ' t worry . you ' ll get good score .
oh man ! i bet you were overwhelmed ! did you stay faithful to her ?
that ##s good ! i would of been anxious to get out of that place if that happen ##d .
oh no ! why are you nervous ?
what topics will the exam be covering ?
i hope so too ! do you know if he is planning on proposing anytime soon ?
ba ##h , he should just do it already ! in the wise words of the late r ##hian ##a : " if you like it you should put a ring on it " .
how come ? were you scared of the dark ?
oh no ! did your parents check your closet before tucking you into bed ?
oh no ! i know car problems can be fr ##ust ##era ##ting .
i hear ya . stay hopeful ##l . it will come soon with der ##ter ##mina ##tion .
i agree . im sure you will find something . i get anxious for new things as well .
awesome ! cute kit ##ties ! did you feed them
yeah . you can always take them to the shelter or post on f ##b if someone wants to adopt them !
wow . that ' s pretty amazing . so many people break up so easily .
she ' s a lucky gal !
these people are becoming so pathetic and out of touch with reality that logic and reasoning are becoming an aliens to them
people at cnn and the whole liberal media who ignore the reality of the people ' s lives and try to project their own moral wonderland onto them
you will do fine , just relax .
then be as prepared as you can .
why do you feel bad ?
oh . i ' m sure she didn ' t mind it . dogs seem to be a lot less sensitive than people .
very good ! i bet your anticipating a good turn out !
well you prepared really well . i feel you will do well on this test !
where did you lie ? i ' m on a new diet that i ' m really happy with
yeah i know , it ' s time for us to get healthy !
i love canada , do you speak french ?

oh no you should buy her a new one !
i ' m sorry : ( i bet she got upset
then why are you ex ##cite about it ?
why do you say that ?
oh i didn ' t know that was really happening .
so does that mean she isn ' t chu ##bby now ? or still chu ##bby but grew into it ?
that ' s good to hear . so did you match with her on tin ##dr or something ?
nice ! is it a fancy one ?
very nice ! were you excited to drive it ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . you should have some friends over . throw a party and catch up on old times .

u ##gh , i know , i just keep putting it off , nasty root canal
no . what is it ?

why did you guys get divorced ?
well , then it seems like it was a good choice . next time around you will know more what to look for before getting married . i hope you find someone that matches up better with you .
did you like living with your dad ?
that was very kind of her .
oh no ! i bet your so sad right now . im sorry for your loss
i know it can be upset ##ting and sad , but take your time . it will be ok .
that ' s awful , i ' m sorry . does she want to be with the other guy instead of you ?
i hope it all works out with you and your girlfriend .

that can be tough . i hope everything is okay .
good luck with it all .
oh no ! i ' m so sorry , we just went through that with our pup . it ' s a hard choice to have to make .
i ' m sorry you are having to make that choice , but i feel it ' s our duty to them to help them pass on when they are not going to get better and help them not suffer any longer .
me too .
once , but it burned the wall so my mom got rid of it
that ' s so sad . what do you think about that ?
it might be best to send him then . on the bright side , you will still be able to visit him and i am sure he ' ll be taken care of very well .
i agree . its fr ##ust ##era ##ting , especially when it was an important conversation .
how annoying . don ##t pay them now mind ! do your own thing
yu ##m ! i have never had it . i bet you enjoyed it !
maybe i should try it out ! it will be exciting to do so .
oh yeah , i can relate . i always get uneasy before a big test . and i always end up cr ##am ##ming and studying the last minute .
well as long as you know the basic concepts and material and have it fresh in your mind for tomorrow , you should do fine . i find i always worry and end up doing better than i expected .
i cannot stand that ! did this happen to you recently ?
did you say anything to the waitress ? i ' ve always wanted to but never have . my husband tells me not to say anything because then they will spit on my food .
beautiful ! you must be so proud !
that ' s such a great idea ! dance is a great exercise for kids .
that ' s sounds like a lot of fun ! what did you guys do ?
i am glad ya ' ll had a blast . it ' s always good to spend some quality time with the fa ##m .
did you have fun there by yourself at least ?
you should have joined one of the other group ##ls and pretended to belong . see who would ' ve said something first .
me too ! go ##uda is my all time fa ##v . what ' s yours ?
oh yeah , a good mo ##zza ##rella sounds pretty pri ##mo right now . perhaps i ' ll get some mo ##zz sticks from little caesar ##s .
who ##o ! what trick was it ? how old is he ?
so cute ! you must be so proud ! you should teach him more tricks !
could there be a reason that he is ?
it must be frustrating ! how are you gonna go about doing it ?
fun ! you guys got to spend a lot of time together ?
did he pass ? at least you got to appreciate him and show him your love
i agree ! how annoying that is !
i was of been furious as well . how could they ruin a nice day ! !
wow that is a long time . how did you keep it together that long ?
i was hoping for an easier way , but i guess like all worth ##while things hard work is key
oh what show ?
hm must ' ve been a really controversial show .
oh , me too ! what do you love about it ?
if only it was christmas all year long , hu ?
how exciting ! what kind of restaurant to you want to open ?
that sounds amazing ! we need a korean restaurant in our town , i would love for one to open here !
that ' s so sad . did she live a happy and fulfilled life ?
that ' s so nice ! perhaps you should dwell on good memories like that of her to rid yourself of your sadness . we have to remember the good times with our loved ones !
oh i bet ! did you take him outside ?
i use puppy pads in my house in case my dog needs to use the bathroom in the house . those seem to work pretty good !
oh wow nice ! its never too late .
makes me think , what am i doing to reach my goals today ? !
that ' s great news ! you must be excited !
oh go ##sh . wonder why she won ' t be up ##front about it .
you must be so proud and happy ! what a young at ##hel ##ete in the making
wow ! sounds like he was the mvp of the team !
tornadoes can be so terrifying . my house was swept up by one when i was a little kid . but i guess it was okay , since i ended up meeting a talking scare ##crow , a tin man , and a big ole lion .
it is indeed ! it was all swell and dan ##dy until the dar ##n flying monkeys sw ##ooped in . that really put a damp ##er on things .
oh my ! what did she do ?
wow , she sounds like an awful person . i feel bad for her son for not being able to get his car .
i bet your excited about it !
i bet you anti ##ci ##pate it to be good like usual !
i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe you can find a similar place around you !
how long have you been waiting for ? hang in there .
that ' s awesome . 1 year down . keep at it , buddy .
ha ##ha ##ha i have not heard that from many people .
i know ! then you get to the bowling alley , try to do what they do , end up getting 3 gut ##ter balls in a row , and fall flat on your butt to boot !
me and you both , friend . we can always try and have a blast though ! i ' m sure if we keep at it we ' ll get a turkey in a century or two .
u ##gh , are you nervous about it ?
that ' s great to hear . your confidence will no doubt help you tomorrow .
how did that go ? studying is very important in order to do good .
how annoying that could be . she could have ali ##ttle more respect for you .
how frustrating ! i hope you were able to study just a little though .
im sorry man ! stay optimistic ! don ##t be sad about it .
you should definitely change roommate ##s . i had been through such experience and know how more difficulty he can bring . stay away from ir ##res ##pon ##sible people
don ' t get emotional with him and don ' t let anger to ruin your relationship with him . just distance yourself from him . that is it
that really stink ##s . is there any way you ' ll be able to keep up with him to ease the sadness ?
that ' s really rough , my friend . i am sure there must be other folks that you can be ##fr ##ien ##d ! there ' s plenty of nice and kind people in the world .
oh no i am so sorry to hear that !
i can ' t imagine how much that much hurt . i hope you can at least cher ##ish the memories you had together .
nice ! what so happens to be on the master chef ' s menu ?
that ' s sounds delicious . i am sure it ' ll be much better than whatever pizza hut can make !
i would have been running away . what did you do ?
lo ##l . . . . that trash would have been on the ground .
oh nice . what type of stuff does the store sell ?
that ' s cool . i like when stores are organized and not a chaotic mess !
did this happen recently ? did you take it back and admit the error ?
well , you may want to think about admitting it to the store manager and paying for it . especially if it ' s bothering you this much , it ' s the on ##y way to resolve it .
that really sucks . is it because your mom was in the hospital ? i am a psychic , so i tend to know these things .
i am so sorry for your loss . it seems that i have to re - cal ##ib ##rate my psychic abilities .
are you nervous about it ? hope it goes well .
well maybe you should start with a small slope and work your way up . don ' t terri ##fy yourself .
oh man . now i am having images of the movie " it " in my head . what did you do ?
that is unusual behavior for a clown . i would say you might want to call the authorities . there has to be a law against a creepy clown stalker
yeah , ice cream really hits the spot when you ' re tired . especially when it ' s hot in the summer time like this .
when the sun is burning like this i ' d like nothing more than to just lay under a soft serve machine and pull the handle . good times !
nice ! i bet your are excited about this
nice . its nice to know he is content with this decision .
oh no ! how boring . could you call up a few buddies to hang out ?
i can agree . don ##t be too down . im sure you can find some ##ting to keep you busy .
that ' s horrible . were you able to get it up before it stained ?
yeah , one look at a cute face like that and it ' s hard to be mad .
that sucks . did you tell him to go back and get the other one ?
i would ' ve taken that pizza out of the box and smack him upside the head with it . what a lou ##sy guy !
oh no ! did your dog have to go really bad or what happened ?
hopefully with enough training your puppy will let you know when she has to go . it takes time .
i feel ya ! do you have any big plans ?
nice ! i ' ve been in san diego for the past two weeks hitting up the beach . i wish i could go with ya , since my vacation is coming to an end !
are you ready for it ?
yeah i have faith in ya ! ! tear it up !
that is amazing . what a lovely and caring partner you have . you must be a happy person . was it for any special occasion or just a surprise gift ?
that is cute . you should also surprise your partner then with some adorable gift in return of this favor
that ' s good to hear , friend ! i ' ve been trying to work off my debt as well . once it ' s done , i ' m going to chop those things up .
i hear you . that really helped me out a bunch too . it ' ll be so nice when we ' re both debt free !
you must be so proud , but what was it for ?
he must have worked really hard and it paid off . good for him .
that would have been a pleasant surprise ! !
you got a special niece . so talented and kind .
oh wow ! i bet she and you are so excited about it !
what a nice surprise that is ! i bet you anti ##ci ##pate her to love it !
that ' s awful . i hope you can find a new job .
that a far ##t can hospital ##ize anyone is pretty impressive . did your story make the local news ?
oh no , do you think your teacher will find out ?
at least you have learned your lesson , i hope ?
did you have fun ? it ' s always great to face your fears !
ya ##y ! i always find myself really nervous before the ride , but once i ' m off of it , i want to go again !
that sounds so embarrassing ! are you okay ?
i am glad you ' re okay and you laughed it off . just be careful the next time !
how exciting . what was it and did you cry ?
now that is a very interesting first word .
how nice of him ! how did you earn such an honorable gesture ?
ah , well , i hope you enjoyed it ! i am sure that won ' t happen often .
awesome ! ! ! what was the word ?
holy cow ! why didn ' t he say bernie sanders " match me " ! ?
what really grind ##s your gears , friend ? rotten potatoes ? beverly hill ##bill ##ies ?
i hate mine too ! i want to smash that thing with a sl ##edge ##hammer !
oh no ! was your neighbor upset about it . i bet your embarrassed .
i agree . you must find a way to prevent ##thi ##s so you don ##t get embarrassed again .
i am sure they were happy tears . how long had it been ?
that is a long time . i am sure you have a lot of catching up to do
om ##g . driving skills are going down nowadays . you must very angry about it
you should have chased him and must give your piece of mind
oh me too ! ! ! ! that and hee ha ##w both ! how did you cope ?
oh man . so the cancellation of beverly hill ##bill ##ies took a toll on your health ?

that ' s disappointing . i ' m glad that you didn ' t let that stop you , and that you still went out and had a good time !
why weren ' t your friends able to come ?
wow , that ' s kinda mean
you think he will be there next time so you can help him ?
ha ##ha , was that intentional to get revenge on him / her . or just that you were hungry ?
ha ##ha . did you tell him about it ?
very nice . i bet you were full of joy to see them .
i bet they are very sentimental to you . being able to remember those days must feel good
very sweet of him . did he surprise you ?
nice ! he ##s a sweet kid . i bet that brought you joy as well .
that is good , maybe you can get a raise .
will you work there forever ?
ah that sucks , you were going for any business meeting ?
i hope you didn ' t lose that client
oh wow , that ' s not good at all
yeah , that sounds no good , what will you do now ?
wow , you must have been out of this world
only woman knows the hardship and endurance of pregnancy . i am happy for you
how nos ##tal ##gic ! was there anything in there that surprised you ?
that ' s so cute . how old were you ?
what is going on this weekend ?
are you driving with anyone ?
uh oh . better go back and get it !
oh dan ##g . that ##s awful . maybe someone will let you borrow some ?
oh yeah ? why is that ?
that ' s awful . did you confront him ?
is it your first date with her ?
where are you taking her ?
that ' s exciting ! what do you plan to do with it ?
wonderful ! where are you going to go ?
are you looking forward to an event happening then ?
awesome ! that should be a lot of fun !
that is great , how long have you been married ?
that must be a good feeling .
third is very good ! what kind of race ?
oh wow ! do you do a lot of marathon ##s ?
hey you should give that back
hey you should give the money back
what happened ?
did you take a photo of them ?
keep trying , never give up .
maybe you should go to a te ##mp agency .
i am so sorry to hear that . how long have you had him ?
you must have developed strong attachment ##s to him over all these years . to be honest , i am not an animal lover individual
good that you done ! have a relaxing day !
awesome ! enjoy your own time !
i have . sometimes it ' s nice to see what old friends have been up to , and what new friends have done . i don ' t think it ' s too strange .
that definitely changes things . i could understand how that might be considered weird , i agree .
he charged you ?
did it all work out ? or did he completely mess up your car ha ##h
sounds like you ' ve got a lot of faith in your friend .
oh really ? ! i love to read ! what book was it ?
i ' ve never read it , but i might check it out !
that ' s so nice of you . i have been in that place , where i needed help , and was incredibly grateful to those who helped . how did it make you feel ?
i understand ! i just got back to that point of being financially stable . i ' m happy to help where i can but it is tough
i do not have children yet , but hopefully in the future . as long as they are easy to handle .
everyone i talk to say the same thing which has always kind of put me off .
really . . old age is a part of our life . . better enjoy than feeling sad
it is good that you accepted my words . . cheer up . . everything going to be alright . .
i do agree . it seems like more and more people are going through rough times these days . nobody wants to do anything about it .
a lot of people say they care about these issues but i ' d like to see more people put their money where there mouth is . we do live in a society .
oh that sounds so fun , do you have a black belt ?
i understand that , i don ' t even like going to the gym , because i feel like people are always watching me and it makes me feel awkward .
that is the worst , i always hated school when they would make you stand up in front of the class and do things , even worse when you have to do it with someone you are not friends with !
oh no what happened once they got your information ?
did they get any money ?
i am sorry for your loss . how did he die if you don ' t mind me asking ?
that ' s terrible . . . at least you tried to save him .
i bet that was so scary for you ! did they find out what was wrong ?
that ' s a relief ! i ' m glad to hear that he is doing great now !
nervous about the person or nervous that they won ' t take it ?
you should have someone with you . an intimidating person . like your mother in law .
yi ##kes ! that would be really scary ! ! i hope you didn ' t get in the car !
thank goodness it all worked out ! it sounds like you took a bunch of smart precautions !
that must have been so stress ##ful . what did you do ?
thank goodness you found them , and kept your promise .
wow ! i hope it didn ' t cause a lot of damage , i have a bunch of very tall trees in my yard as well .
that ' s terrible i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m also glad you have insurance .
oh i ' ve done that , i hate when that happens . are you going to see them again soon ?
i hope he makes good on his word ! sometimes losing your id can be a very big deal , i know it was when i ' ve lost mine .
aw ##w ##w ! how sweet ! i love kitten ##s , but it sounds like a lot of work !
that was so kind of you to take her in . poor little thing needed a new care ##gi ##ver !
i hate that feeling . i spent $ 50 on groceries i didn ' t exactly need . so i know how you feel .
if i remember right shopping triggers our happy centers . it is hard to stop
could turn out good , could turn out bad . how well do you know your friend ?
well i wish you the best of luck and hope it goes well !
oh that ' s good , you both must have had a very trusting relationship .
that ' s good , but why aren ' t you still together now ?
ye ##a , sometimes we take those who care about us for granted .
i ' m in florida , jump and a bus come back , we need you !
that ' s understand ##able , no one knows your pets like you do .
ye ##a , at the end of the day i guess all you can do is hope for the best .
oh no ! i hope everything is ok ! was she mad ?
it can happen i bet . just try to make this the only time , and in my experience , you ' re going to have to pull out all the stops with this dinner !
that is so sweet . i love cats , but i ' m allergic to them so we can ' t have any . it makes me sad .
i ' m glad they help you forget about all your cares though . you are lucky to have them
what ? how ? is it ok now ?
well that ' s good news at least ! i hope you are better too .
oh my god , that ' s horrible . i ' m really sorry to hear that . i hope you ' re doing okay .
nothing can really replace a loved pet you had for a long time , all you have is memories really .
it ' s important to have faith that things will work out the way they should ! i ' m a strong believer in that !
sometimes it ' s hard when things seem to always go against you . just remember that god doesn ' t give us more than we can handle ! you ' ll come out a stronger person in the end . i wish you the best !
you can always use and old mason jar wrapped in some hem ##p fiber
oh you can be ! everyone can ! it just takes the will to cut the fabric !
it ' s always a good thing to be able to focus on things that don ' t have to do with money .
no need to be sorry ! you are at a place that we all should be able to be but for many reasons can not . good job !
you know sometimes it is hard to predict something like that
but if you don ' t buy now , as the prices go higher , you will regret it
oh i ' m sorry to hear that but i ' m glad you have a good friend !
hopefully everything has been up ##hill since then !
exciting , what concert ?
that would be so nice , i have not went to a concert in ages
that ' s too bad . we always want to give our kids the things they want . i ' m sure he ' ll under ##st ##nad
well there will be plenty of time for him to still build that skill as he grows up
oh that sounds nice , have you had trouble in the past staying committed ?
well , life isn ' t a football game , so " fumble ##s " are something that everyone does .
i know exactly what you mean . it ' s really tough but when i make decisions i try to stand on them and be willing to pi ##vot if necessary .
that sounds right to me . i actually have a few people around me that give me straight forward advice like that .
sometimes it can be true . don ' t be taken for a run
i hope that everything turns out the best for you too !
congratulations , that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace .
that ' s understand ##able , i ' m sure it will be exciting to custom ##ize and fur ##nish your space .
how long has it been since you had your old dog ?
it might take a bit of time to get back into the swing of owning a dog . i ' m sure you ' ll be ready soon if you still think it over .
i lost my job , so i know how you feel . it is tough not have a source of income .
sometimes you got to just do it and hope and pray all comes out like it should , and it usually does .
it ' s never to late to continue on that path or find a new one . same happened here .
i always try to remind myself . tomorrow is a new day . what do you want to do with yours ?
that ' s terrible . i don ' t know what ' s up with this world anymore , it seems like things are always getting worse .
well if they were family heir ##lo ##om or photographs , i don ' t really think the money would have been important . the family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping .
have you tried talking to them about this ?
that ' s really frustrating , they ' ll realize only when you start di ##stan ##cing yourself from them
did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence ? i hope there were no hard feelings !
sorry for the delay . i had a technical difficulty . either way , i ' m sure there were no hard feelings . a lot of people sign up to work those camps every year .
that ' s completely understand ##able . have you tried distracting yourself with ho ##bbies or productive chores ?
that ' s the best thing you can do really . i hope she comes back soon for your sake !
any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me . i ' ve never heard of blue bell though , is it any good ?
i ' ll need to find some and give it a taste myself ! that sounds awesome .
oh no , that ' s such an awful thing for them to do . do your cats often ruin things in the household ?
oh odd . that ' s a good way to look at it though ; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things .
and is he okay with that ?
i suppose that makes sense . as long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic , that ' s all that counts !
what happened to yours ?
that is a real shame , at least you can hold on to your memories .
dan ##g that ' s a definite mood killer . at least you ' ve got a fix on the way .
one can only hope !
well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn ' t good .
yeah forest fires are getting really bad .
odd ! any idea where you went wrong ?
practice definitely makes perfect !
how old are they now ?
soon they will be leaving the nest , hey ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . are you better now ?
i hope it is nor sam ##one ##lla , just a temporarily bug .
you guys sound like great grand kids , i bet she whole ##hearted ##ly appreciated it .
i bet you guys were close and this certainly brought you all closer together . i ' m so happy that you had these connections with your family .
sounds like fun ! did you enjoyed it ? how far did you go ?
great ! love road trips ! i hope to take one soon .
why has your week been so busy ?
do you know what movie you plan on watching ?
yi ##kes ! that must have caught you off guard .
murphy ' s law i suppose . i ' m sure it wasn ' t so bad though in the end .
oh no ! did he take it okay ?
that ' s sweet that you guys are able to let the small things go . it sounds like you have a great relationship .
i ' m in the same boat . i ' m so happy to hear that and i hope you get the job !
companies that pay their workers well equals happy workers !
are you excited for the new group ?
well , i hope it goes well !
must be hard when you can ' t physically see what you are doing .
yeah youtube is a good source of information .
oh no that sucks ! what book ?
ah i ' ve never read it before , i was hoping it would have been one i ' m familiar with .
oh the nostalgia of watching old movies . what movie ?
unfortunately i ' ve never heard of it !
i used to want to do that so bad when i was younger . was it amazing ?
that ' s so awesome . i don ' t think i would have the courage now . will you do it again ?
that ' s a great goal to set for yourself . where do you work if i may ask ?
sounds important . i hope you ' re able to meet your goal !
it must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone , and motorcycles can be fun !
awesome . i ' ve only rode dirt bikes personally , but i definitely see the appeal .
aw , i ' ve been there , i bet you like it ! especially after you get used to it .
that is such a great attitude !
that ' s terrifying ! i bet you didn ' t sleep that night !
ha ! are you a fan of horror movies now , or do you still find them scary ?
yeah , me either , although there have been some good ones lately . better stories , more plot .
i am sorry to hear that , i hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time .
yes i know . it hasn ' t been easy for me either , but i believe think will go our way pretty soon .
wow that ' s so exciting ! i bet he ' s a nice guy in real life .
cool ! that ' s so neat .
oh no . maybe you can find one that is used , or even rebuilt . i got my car for 75 % less than what i would ' ve paid from a car dealer !
well , stick through it ! i wish you luck : )
oh , i could do that if i didn ' t have bad teeth and can ' t handle the cold . i would regret it if i did though because i really need to lose some weight .
lo ##l , burn those cal ##ories . hope you have a high metabolism .
what happened ?
well , you gave him the benefit of the doubt . it was his decision to cheat .
now you have more information to base your next decision on . you live you learn .
that ' s kind of him ! is he good at that sort of thing ?
yes you ' d have more warrant ##y kind of things with work from a dealers ##hip
that ' s awesome ! i wish someone in my family was so handy !
wow ! maybe you should take uncle out for dinner ! lo ##l
me too . old photos bring about such nostalgia .
i can only imagine ! when my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and i , they get tear ##y - eyed .
wow , that ' s such an honor . how do you feel about it ?
i ' d be very nervous too . i get stage fright .
i bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you . i ' m sorry for your loss .
that ' s great . it ' s just as good to remember the great times you spent together as it is to gr ##ie ##ve .
get away with what ?
did you get caught using them ? !
wow ! that ' s terrible ! maybe next time just get a tutor instead of cheating !
sorry this happened !
oh dear ! what happened ! ?
oh my goodness ! good for you for getting away from that trouble !
next day guilt when the fun is done . how awful . i wonder if they ' ll fe ##ss up .
yi ##kes . i ' m glad you ' re not mixed up in that !
how did that go ? do you like that ?
oh no ! really ? were they upset ?
who was it with ?
were you more mad at them or your spouse ?
what was it ? did everything turn out alright ?
ph ##ew ! i ' m glad that ' s all it was .
that ' s terrible when friends fight . what was it over ?
that ' s got to be a tough phone call to make . did you two make amend ##s or is she very upset ?
uh oh don ' t want to be that kid that ' s for sure !
how interesting . how does that make you feel ?
yes , i think that would be a little surreal , and i might feel am ##bi ##valent about it .
i felt the same way as you , but what ' s the point of keeping things you don ' t use and having it take up space ? do you use everything in your closet ?
so the items are sentimental to you ? i know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them , but at the end of the day , they are just items ! : )
oh how sweet ! what did it say ?
i love finding treasures like that !
i hope that i am able to share such nice things with my own kids one day .
i really enjoy that too !
that is a lot of work ! but i bet the reunion will be fun .
yu ##m , i love making and also eating dessert ##s ! do you have a specialty ?
oh that ' s one of my fa ##ves . my go to is cheese ##cake .
it ' s a crowd please ##r . i love the dip ##s and apps at get together ##s like that .
is that like hospice care ? how do you deal with seeing loss so frequently ?
i ' m sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times .
i bet it is . thank you for giving your time to this type of work .
you deserve them ! that ' s excellent to hear .
oh no ! i hate when i ' m hungry for something and it goes wrong like that !
the worst ! did you find something else to eat ?
better than nothing but still no patty melt !
that ' s exciting . is that something you want to do ?
that could definitely be tough . especially with a baby .
really , did you get to pick the movie ?
oh wow that ##s always nice when everyone can agree on the same movie .
that ' s always nice , how did you respond ?
that ' s cool , nothing wrong with being faithful .
nice , jobs are ok , but a new ride is really fun . what did you get
toyota ' s usually last a long time so it might be a good decision .
wow , was it embarrassing ?
dan ##g ! well at least you got a good story to tell now !
oh really , hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun .
well at least you get to be with the man you love . . . hopefully
as long as you ' re safe about it . you can meet up at police stations too !
more people are open and into it so yo uc ##an always talk to your police about it
wow . that ' s a long time . longer than i ' ve been alive ! cong ##rat ##s on your successful marriage . got any tips ?
thanks for the advice . i have trouble letting the petty things go but i think i ' ll learn to be better as time goes by . i wish you a happy marriage !
oh ##hh ##h , that ' s so sad . i remember ( long ago ) when that happened to me . did he / she live a good long life ?
yeah , that is a shame . i ' m so sorry to hear about your loss . i know how important a great teacher can be your life .
are you nervous ? or do you have amazing confidence in your ability ?
do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand . that is just as important .
how old is your son ?
i can understand why you felt so nervous . a mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn . you should get him a ga ##ur ##d dog when he ' s a bit older if you still feel that way .
wow ! i enjoy watching over ##watch on twitch occasionally . would you say that ' s your favorite game ?
i never got into cod and i tried over ##watch when it first came out but i wasn ' t very good . fort ##ni ##te on the other hand i ' m alright at .
that ' s awesome ! what did you have done ?
i can imagine . things like are always so stress ##ful , but so nice once they are completed .
make sure to bring sm ##ores and bug spray . i hate bug bites . and love chocolate
make sure you bring something to drink as well . can get quite thirsty ya know .
oh i feel you ! every time i go back to stay with my family it feels . . . claus ##tro ##phobic almost .
i ' m sure they are ! it ##ll feel more normal soon , i am sure
what ' s wrong with your tooth ? i hope it ' s not too painful of an experience .
yi ##kes ! i ' ve had that before . my thoughts are with you . i ' m sure the dentist will take care of it though .
that ' s awful . what are you going to do ?
what type of dog is it ?
interest are you going to try and get him to sell it ?
that will be fun , maybe he will even let you play his xbox on it .
same . when you had one phone in the middle of the house with the super long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk .
i agree . the convenience is nice now , but the quality is much lower .
were you close to your wife ' s grandmother ?
that is very heartbreak ##ing . im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well .
im sure your wife also appreciate ##s you getting along with her family .
those times seemed much simpler didn ' t they ? do you ever break out of the routine ?
i see . how do you like playing the piano ?
that ' s the spirit . i bet you ' re a wonderful pianist .
awesome ! anything exciting on the horizon to treat yourself ?
what ' s the one you are most excited about ?
well that stink ##s . what are they drilling for ?
are they almost done with it ?
oh no what happened ?
that is sad . i am sure you can come up with a good career . what do you like to do ?
that ' s exciting and nerve wr ##ack ##ing at the same time i bet . how do you feel about it ?
for sure . well good luck ! nurses are very under - appreciated . i hope you get .
that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed
oh that ' s exciting . are you nervous to have them over ?
i bet it ' s all in your head . i am sure it will all good smooth .
aw ##w that ' s so cute ! was it tough trying to get it to swim ?
proud of the little pup !
that ' s so creepy and scary . what happened next ?
why are there so many weird ##os in this world ? i ' m glad you made it out safe .
what for ? i hope it wasn ' t for anything dangerous .
that ' s a little dangerous . i ' d definitely talk to her about why you didn ' t allow her to go to that party , and maybe she ' ll realize that what you ' re doing is for her own good .
yes i understand ! it is so hard to lose weight !
yes . chocolate is my nemesis . i think it is more addict ##ing than cocaine
ou ##ch , that ' s unfortunate . hopefully it turned out okay though ?
i can imagine , talk about bad timing injuring your toes !
oh no ! did you get in trouble ?
good for you for standing up for your little brother . hope the kid is ok though .
sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that you ' re away from it . i ' m happy that you have that realization .
are they gone now or is a reunion possible ?
god ' s plan ! do you know why he did it ?
dan ##g , i wish i could have it happen to me someday !
that ' s great ! such a satisfying feeling ! did you get a good grade ?
i hope you were really proud of yourself : - )
that ' s really good news . it must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly . is your family happy with the place ?
i hope you and your family enjoy the new home .
am ##en . what kind of dogs do yo have ?
aw little guys . do they walk well on the leash ?
that ' s about how mine is . he is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder . i found using a harness has helped .
he is a mix breed . we don ' t really know .
that sounds great ! are you excited ?
i hope you accomplish everything !
oh my goodness . that must have been traumatic to see . do you know what happened to the dog ?
well , i ' m sorry you had to see that !
i agree with that . i always try to give the benefit of the doubt at first .
oh man . bless your soul ! i bet that can test your patience .
im sure it can be highly reward ##ing too .
i ' m glad it ' s over and nothing happened . do you have an underground shelter ?
oh , i would be scared too . apartments seem safe unless the roof gets ripped of of coarse .
are you excited ?
i hope you do it !
congratulations ! that is exciting . how long have you been waiting for this .
very cool . i wish you all the best .
i ' m a freelance ##r
started out slow but now it is !
oh no ! not the old pop on the rug trick . did you yell ?
what kind of dog ? i have a boston terri ##er . she ' s the cute ##st .
oh cute ! what a devil .
mine too . can ' t help it , those eyes !
oh no ! did you have to go home and change ?
what a bum ##mer ! sorry to hear that .
that is so cool ! im not married yet
maybe , im not sure yet
aw that ' s tough ! have you talked to him about it ?
it might have upset him but i ' m sure he ' ll understand ! everyone loses their temper sometimes and it ' s not like you didn ' t have a leg ##it reason
i hope it ' s a lot more than just a gift card but at least starbucks should be a lot of money because it ' s so expensive there !
oh yes then you need much more than a starbucks gift card ! good luck ! !
i am sorry that must have been tough . she probably felt bad for you .
that is great because friendships are very important
ok , that ##s lovely
its shows a lot of care
a point of what ? like , of land ?
oh boy . i ' m not sure where you ' d find one . that ' s pretty old fashioned . did you find one ?
oh no ! that must have put you in a bad position . how did you handle it ?
sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation - good job !
hi friend who is too good to you ?
that ' s good though ! i bet you ' re grateful .
that ##s so cool of you
ye ##a , that ##s the right thing to do
i know ! that must be frustrating . do you have enough money to cover it ?
oh wow . . . it seems like bad things always hit at once like that . hang in there - i hope it will get better for you !
i ' m sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger !
oh that ' s so great - and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often !
it does sound like fun , though . did you have a good time ?
are you ever going to do it again or are you done ? i went when i was a child .
true . easier said than done though . how can we be ?
define ##tly ! it starts with a single person right
did you layer had the surgery ?
oh , cong ##rat ##s dear
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that ! that must have been upset ##ting .
then you must have felt relief .
oh i am so sorry , i am assuming the injury was serious ?
oh man i hope you got a second opinion ? i would be so worried about your injury . i am so sorry .
hasn ' t everyone done so at some point ?
at ##lea ##st it wasn ' t in class at a college or something , right ?
i wouldn ' t sweat it , chances are you won ' t see any of those people again right ? even if you do , it ' s unlikely they ' ll remember you let alone your smell ##y far ##t .
oh my go ##sh that ' s so cute ! i bet they were the cute ##st .
i ' m sure it does , i don ' t have any of my own but i would be really sentimental .
yes , but think of all the opportunities it can open up . don ' t let fear stop you !
i know , but i ' m sure you ' ll do great ! i went to school for many years through a master ' s degree , and although it was hard , it was worth it .
did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in ?
be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework . not many parents do that for their children
oh no ! i bet you were so mad ! were you able to find something else to snack on ?
that is heartbreak ##ing . that sounds really good . never purchased one of those .
i am completely agree . how long have you been married ?
constant work and attention is key to a great relationship !
that sucks . i hate having scratched glasses
yes and it always bother ##s me looking through sc ##at ##ches .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so i know your pain .
it takes awhile for it to be over . find a hobby to take your mind off of it . it helps to ease the pain .
yes , that is always a hard situation .
oh man that is horrible ! i am so sorry
that ' s the best decision . i know mine wouldn ' t either . if he is a good guy , he will understand .
that ' s good . no sense in rocking the boat .
it is definitely good to get that looked at right away . then they can take care of it !
oh i know it ' s hard . just try to relax and it will go quick .
nice ! did it help you become less stressed ?
dan ##g , well i hope you can continue your goal of med ##itating every day !
scared of what
oh , don ##t mind me , just been curious
why is that ?
i feel that , plus it ' s nice not to have to worry about returning it .
oh that ##s not good . . sometimes teenagers can be ali ##ttle messy
well i am sure he will get better with age
i think theme park rides are scary ! was it scary when you were stuck ?
they are really good about that . they have a lot of safety features you don ' t even realize . we were stuck on space mountain once .
aw ##w ##w , you ' re speaking fond ##ly on when he was young . is he not as nice anymore ?
that ' s de ##pressing to here . i have family members who are still cool now as well , but i just think so fond ##ly on when they were younger . they grow up too fast , and it really is amazing when they ' re young and innocent and haven ' t been exposed to the real world yet .
i suppose , but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation , especially when the health of others are in their hands .
that is true . there are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book .
dogs are wonderful pets . they are so loving and devoted . what kind of dog do you have ?
that ' s an awesome name . i have two fei ##sts . if you ' re not familiar with the breed , they resemble jack russell terri ##ers , but they are bred for squirrel hunting . their names are whiskey and ruby .
all the time i am not sure i believe in god
that ' s pretty crazy you could of had your money and the care package too
yeah i understand what you mean definitely
oh , i am so sorry ! i am an animal lover , too . we have two dogs now , but used to have cats , too . we did have to say goodbye ##s to some of our pets over years . it ' s heart breaking . . .
how long did you have your cat ?
was it a holiday ?
it sounds like a fun event .
oh no ! that is so frustrating .
that is good that you are a nice friend to her .
i am sure you were . was boot camp really hard
i could never do something like that . thank you for your service
oh wow . i would hate that . what ended up being the issue ?
maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office . he ' s moved on up .
oh no - - how is she feeling now ?
yeah , that had to be tough . i ' m glad she ' s doing better now though .
what a bum ##mer ! what place did you end up getting ?
i know the feeling . you work so hard just to feel crushed .
did you get hurt or drown a bit ?
nice , well hopefully nothing like that ever happens again !
i sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat
oh , you shouldn ' t feel bad about it , i ' m sure it was fine to eat !
that ' s really good you guys can trust each ##oth ##er like that . that helps make you both grow in the relationship .
wow ! you don ' t see much of that anymore . so true .
yes , i am a product of a broken marriage . my children are too . keep up the good work you guys !
where were you not invited to ?
you were not invited ? ! that ' s awful . how close are you to your friend ?
hey , were you injured ?
hope they took it easy with you ?
aw ##w that is so sweet . i completely understand why ! oh and thank you for your apology but i am truly content and have accepted it .
men are crazy sometimes ! lo ##l !
sounds like a fun one to me . are you happy there ?
i agree . im sure you get bored or lonely while traveling too .
who is that ?
sometimes we have to learn how to not be jealous of things
that ##s always a good feeling . i bet you are excited to come home everyday .
what a good dog and full of joy !
i bet she loves you just at much as you love her .
i hope you have a good time and you enjoy it .
i bet , everyone should take time out yo enjoy life every once in awhile .
did you do it ? how far does he live from you ?
oh no ! was he mad ?
what happen ##d ?
what is a hot slap ? sounds painful !
they haven ' t called you back yet ? i hate when that happens , they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles !
don ' t let it break your confidence though , it just wasn ' t meant to be . i think you ' ll land your next application though .
uncertainty can be so ago ##ni ##zing . just keep your head up though !
oh my go ##sh ! have they broken it ? that would drive me nuts .
have you spoken to them personally ? maybe they should pay for you to move it !
wow . i ' m so sorry . maybe you could put concrete around it so it damages their car ? lo ##l
wow that sounds intriguing , what new things did you try ?
that ' s awesome , cows are amazing
yeah , it ' s crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too , having kids must be surreal
me too , it ' s like you realize more and more that all you have is the present moment .
wow , cong ##rat ##s , what did you end up naming him ?
you are lucky , and i am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it .
sounds exciting . i always wanted to leave my were i was originally from so i could experience and see new things
no , but i hope things work out for you in this new part of your life .
oh definitely . why did you ?
i can . i ' m so sorry . was it something really bad ? or were you able to move on from it ?
it ' s always fun to get new clothes ! is the wedding soon ?
i ' m not very fashionable , but i do have some t - shirts that i love to wear because they fit me really well .
sounds like a real hard decision . i would be very app ##re ##hen ##sive as well .
you sound so excited about it and your future there . i would be full of joy as well .
that sounds like some good work experience . how long is he in .
well , hopefully he is as good as sherlock holmes and saves some lives .
that ' s the worst . i wonder if he was trying to prove something .
good ! i don ' t know why people think they can get away with things like that .
cong ##rat ##s , how did you handle the pressure ?
it can be pretty nerve rack ##ing , but it is always great practice . you will only get better .
om ##g ! especially recently . a week seems like one day .
that ' s so true . my daughter moved out this year and i ' m wondering where the heck the time went !
oh really ? are you a massage therapist ?
wow congratulations ! you must be so excited !
i ' m good , what ' s up ?
yeah , that must be difficult
way to go ! if it makes you feel better i would be your friend if i was there
i used to , but yeah especially if you ' re not in school
hope you didn ' t take a bath after that
minus one for cats
wow brazil ? isn ' t there a lot of crime there ?
what is she going to do there , sounds kind of dangerous .
that ' s good , how does that make you feel
nice , i like your attitude
nice , too bad i wasn ' t invited !
sounds fun ! keep fighting the good fight lo ##l
no ! i think that should be on my bucket list though .
i bet that would be cool . i ' ve watched on tv . they know what their doing .
what are you waiting for ?
oh i totally know how that goes . i moved to small town and didn ' t have many friends at first . once i had my son and made more friends it got way better lo ##l !
thanks , you as well . i know how that is . give it time and things will get better .
yeah , i think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway .
aw , i know how that goes . do they visit often ?
wow that ' s sad . i ' m sorry .
that does sound exciting ! why are you scared ?
oh , that is definitely a change ! but at least you can still keep in touch nowadays .
yeah i have one , but they ' re all over the place it seems like
that ' s funny , just don ' t let it in your room while your sleeping !
babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump .
it ' s a pretty small percentage , but it would definitely be something to worry about .
wow that would be terrible news . i can ' t image ##d shit is taking it well .
hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well . glad you are there to help her .
that is horrible , i am so sorry , it is hard losing a baby animal , you are not expecting them to pass , like when you have an older sick ##ly one
that is crazy , i wonder what was wrong with it
wow , i never knew cats could even get an an ##eur ##ys ##m , but i guess like humans why wouldn ' t they be able to ?
ah ##hh ##h that ##s amazing ! i stay home with my kids too ! how many kids do you have ?
it definitely can be a challenge . i have a 10 year old boy , an 8 year old girl , and a 2 year old girl . i love being home with them .
oh no , what happened ? did they do or say something ?
oh girl , that happens to me all the time too . so frustrating , just leave us alone .
i ' m sorry , is it difficult to take care of her ?
dan ##g , i hope everything turns out okay for you guys
hmm , how did that make you feel
yeah , at least now you ' re more aware , it can be pretty tough when you ' re trying to break the habit though
good to hear that you keep your word
keep it up bro ##cha ##cho
at least that shows that you have a conscience . i hope that you made it up to them .
confess to them what happened . let them know how you have changed .
wow , i am sure the veterans loved it ! what kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them ?
so thoughtful of you ! what did the kids think of visiting the veterans ?
wow that is some really early christmas shopping . you must like to plan ahead .
yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high .
i love vegetable soup . so were you able to enjoy your nap ?
well i ' m happy for you . its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes .
sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust . you may want to sort it all out before you get too involved .
maybe you couldn ' t but it sounds like something is going on with her .
that was nice of them . did you have any problems with their car ?
that is good to hear . what happened to your own car ?
well at least you can trust him to be careful . i don ##t think i would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet .
yes its amazing how much of a difference a few years can make in age . it seems that males take quite aw ##ile long to mature than females .
that ' s so nice of you , i would have chased down the car , but you did the right thing
feels bad , hope you have someone to talk about it with !
what kind of job is it ? i will keep my fingers crossed he gets it !
that ##s awesome , does it pay better than the one he has ? a pay increase is certainly helpful .
oh wow i am glad she was happy , why were you nervous ?
oh don ' t be , you should be happy for her , there will come a time where you will get something back in return : )
boy o - boy bet she is having the time of her life . how many vacation ##s have you taken this year ?
me too , maybe our wish will come true only time will tell .
oh , no ! what happened ?
oh wow ! that ' s like the worst nightmare ! i ' m so sorry that happened to you ! !
were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from em ##bar ##ss ##ment ?
i ' m sure that was not a fun ride home .
where you disappointed ?
i remember the same thing . and the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss
where do you live ?
alright , so do you ever have to evacuate ?
maybe go earlier later ?
oh , that ' s kind of weird
. . . im sorry , how did it happen
that sucks , but hey man it ' s okay one day you ' ll find right person
nice ! the married life is expensive
i hope you two have a nice future . at least you know the family will support you !
oh ! what happened ?
wow ! you lazy bum . you disappointed me too !
that sounds awful . who was it you wrong ##ed ?
was she understanding and for ##giving ?
i ' m sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly !
i hope that you see amazing results , and you continue to enjoy yourself !
do you think it ' s possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake ?
i think that when people cheat and lie , it ' s because something is wrong with them and not their partner . if he doesn ' t realize his mistake , then he doesn ' t deserve your love . i wish you all the best !
i hope you realize your worth too . i do this thing where i think about another woman in my life who i really care about ( mom , daughter , etc . ) and i think " if this was happening to them , what kind of advice would i give them ? " sometimes , we think we deserve less .
what do you mean ?
oh , what happen ##d
yes i do , that ' s why i only trust one person , my wife
im sorry , what did happen ##d next ? how does that make you feel ?
what happened to you ?
that ' s horrible ! did you have any sort of tracker on it ?
aw ##we that is so sweet , how did you two meet ?
wow that sounds like a really big journey . it must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chat ##s .
mmm that sounds delicious . there is always time to make pan ##cake tuesday ##s at home !
i see , memories will always stay , sometimes good old days just can ' t come back .
i haven ' t , but it ' s definitely on my bucket list !
i bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing .
i have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor . he jumps almost every weekend . he will be taking me when i go !
i believe i was fifteen . i drove a soccer mom van !
did you ever get caught ? !
oh no ! i would have been furious ! were you able to catch him ?
oh im so sorry ! i bet your are dev ##est ##ated ! i would be tool .
oh okay . . . . was that even a temptation to begin with ?
alright ##y then , just seemed like a really weird thing to say .
oh no that is awful ! it is against the law where i live to ban animals from the house . so legally i am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed .
canada ! you should check the laws in your area to see whether or not you are legally allowed to have a pet even if the land lords do not approve .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope she ' ll be doing good , she is very lucky to have someone taking care of her .
you must have a very good connection , that ' s beautiful .
oh no ! hopefully you didn ' t get too many nasty stares !
oh well , accidents happen !
i ' ve had a similar experience with a gossip ##ing cow ##or ##ker . it made the workplace such an uncomfortable environment !
it ' s a good lesson to learn ! don ' t worry about it too much . i am sure that the truth will surface eventually .
wow that sure is a lot of stuffed animals , did you play with toys al ##ot at a kid ?
what kind of interests ?
that ' s very exciting ! i ' m sure he put a lot of work towards that .
all the work paid off !
did you end up ending the friendship ?
you didn ' t let anything affect the friendship ! that ' s good i am proud of you
oh that is definitely something to be excited about !
that is quite unique . i ' m happy to hear that !
that must have been so painful , don ' t get embarrassed it happens to everyone , people far ##t in public transports , people fall and rip their jeans , people cry over stupid things , it ' s a totally normal thing
you sure will , besides hot jock ##s doesn ' t sound too bad too me : 3
was that your idea ? why did you decide to do that ?
you must really trust her to let her hold on to your life ' s savings !
my condo ##lence ##s to you . will you be able to visit his graves ##ite ?
yes , it will be worth saving up for . i hope it works out for you .
i hope that nothing came of it though .
i ' m sure nothing happened ! gotta have some trust .
great confidence ! what do you anti ##ci ##pate your grade to be
you prepared well ! you will do goo .
that ' s great ! good luck
why is that ?
i can agree with that
i a so sorry to hear that . how are you coping with your loss ?
yes , sometimes that is the only thing you can do . i hope you are also getting some support from family and other friends
you sound prepared for it ! im sure you have practiced .
very nice ! keep the confidence and don ##t doubt yourself tomorrow .
hey what is up ?
oh , no want to talk about it ?
oh no , that ' s terrible , what are you going to do ?
well that ' s no good , you could try tap ##ing it back together
that ' s great i always love to hear about happy couples . too much bad news in the world .
oh , eats lots of cake and make sure to have a nice dinner with candles . maybe a bubble bath too .
hi there , how ' re you ?
i ' m doing well . it ' s quite early in the morning though , that ' s for sure .
i know the feeling when you finally have your own place to do what you want .
good or bad i have been in that situation many times . more recently when i was separated from my current wife . my own place . finally !
why ? what did he do ?
oh i know this feeling , but don ' t worry it ' s okay ! these things happen , soon feeling will disappear
i hope you do too . sounds like you did well preparing .
very good ! i anti ##ci ##pate you will get in !
is your dog ok ?
does your sister usually have problems ?
what did you eat ?
that sounds like the worst feeling .
ah i know this feeling , how did the conversation go ?
it ' s okay , next just tell them that you didn ' t quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again
you shouldn ' t be so attached to your old stuff , you might end up a ho ##ard ##er !
well that is a good reason to keep holding on to something !
oh no . did you study for it ?
i hope it goes better than you expect ! cr ##am all that information into your brain !
what makes you so afraid of them ? they do eat all the other creepy - crawl ##ies , after all .
true , they aren ' t a very visually appealing species . but at least they ' re more afraid of you , that ' s some consolation .
oh no how did you feel ?
i totally understand that feeling and know what you mean ! but i wouldn ' t sweat over it , it happens to the best of us and we learn fr ##o our mistakes !
i usually stick with what i know also
absolutely , especially when spending a lot of money
that sounds awful . i hope he is better now !
it ' s wonderful you had someone like your mother to help !
oh no ! maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it ?
hopefully she will understand !
awesome , i bet you ' re with your puppy all the time now : )
pup ##pies are so wonderful , i ' m happy for you !
i know what you mean , maybe ask if the place is hiring ?
oh ##h okay i see , yeah that is a difficult situation . i hope it works out for you and best of luck buddy ! : )
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope she gets better .
i ' m glad that she is getting better !
i can ' t imagine what that must have felt like . what helped you get through it ?
at least you kept your sense of humor !
did you hear the " you ' ll be a ditch - digger " speech like my brother did ?
not everyone is cut out for sitting in a classroom listening to dr ##oning teach - speak .
that doesn ' t sound like such a pleas ##urable memory . maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had !
you know what they say , the grass is always greene ##r on the other side . did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snow ##board ?
i ' m not afraid of clown myself , but i can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people !
i agree with you . those painted smiles and big , red noses can be so off - putting !
that is awesome , can you tell me more about what you will be doing ?
wow that sounds really awesome , i would love to listen to you songs . can i also be the first to receive your auto ##graphs ? : )
wow , she must be a talented child ! i ' m sure you ' re so proud of her .
now that ' s an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life !
cong ##rat ##s ! that is always a great feeling .
it certainly has . you deserve it .
how did that turn out ?
cong ##rat ##s ! that ' s awesome to hear .
ha ##ha we all did crazy things when we were young ! did you ever get caught ?
good plan . wait until the shop ##keeper was busy with someone else .
cong ##rat ##lu ##ations ! i bet your full of joy !
i bet you are ! i think you will enjoy your new home and city !
i bet ! have you gotten any word back yet ?
congratulations ! you ' re going to do wonderful , i just know it !
oh no ! how awkward ! did anyone see it ?
probably but that is still the worst thing ever . are you finally able to laugh about it ?
i am glad ! you must have a very good vet ##erina ##rian
well i ' m glad that you found someone worthy !
oh my goodness ! is she going to be alright ?
the unknown is always so scary , but especially in your case ! i ' m so happy that she ' s going to be ok . hopefully that puts you more at ease now .
that is wonderful . what is your dogs name ?
that ' s a big dog . blu is a cool name !
do you at least enjoy the new job ?
hopefully the more you warm up to the new job , it will become easier .
that sounds awesome . a lot of people would kill to have a cooperative work environment . i bet it increases performance as well .
wow that sounds like an interesting process ! i ' ve never done it myself , but it sounds like something i would love to learn .
i love the foo fighters too . i would have be raging ! what happened ?
well that ##s not too bad then . good on you for putting your education and studies first . im sure it wasn ##t easy at the time .
oh lo ##l .
i hope that business goes well !
that ' s great . i am sure you will turn a profit in no time
why 8 years ? that ' s a very specific time ago .
that ' s ridiculous ! they were clearly not your friends . there are much better people in the world .
it should be fun ! do you like baseball ?
i think you will be fine . if you need some alcohol to take the edge off , go for it .
that ' s terrible , you had no clue it was coming ?
what did the note say ?
how long did it take you ? that ' s amazing .
i consider you to be a lucky guy . i hope one day i can pay mine off completely .
my husband owns a business and its also stress ##ful . what kind of business did ya ##ll start ?
oh . what do you do for that ?
at least you are comfortable and enjoying that ! some people would hate being alone .
that is great ! i ' m sure everything will work out .
hi ! tell me something about yourself !
oh no ? i hope you ' re okay . why is it that you feel guilty ?
oh wow ! did she notice ?
how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know ?
you must have been really drunk !
im sorry to hear that . i know that can be stress ##ful .
yeah i hope so too . that must be painful to bare .
im sorry . i can imagine how you felt ! hopefully you hit a home run !
that ##s something i would never forget . hopefully you get another shot at it .
i totally understand what you mean . peace and quiet is nice but i bet you miss your son when he is gone ?
that ' s not surprising ! are you thinking about going back to work soon ?
wow that is a lot of people ! what were you doing on stage ?
that would make me so nervous ! i am horrible in front of people . how did it go ?
so sorry to hear that , hard to be alone .
what did he train you in ?
wow , tell me about it
that is great , so happy for you
are you friends with your neighbor
you shouldn ' t be em ##bar ##rase ##d around your best friends . i ' m sure he ' s just picking in good fun
oh no that doesn ' t sound good . what almost happened ?
well i ' m glad you sober ##ed up and didn ' t do anything you would regret later !
oh , don ##t take it so hard , its always like that , so sorry about that
it will work out if you believe
what were you trying to do ?
did they ever come ?
oh absolutely . that ' s the worst feeling . who hurt you and how are you doing now ?
dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy , but in reality it ' s just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes . i hope things go well for you and you meet someone who makes you very happy !
ah . i can imagine i ' ve been in a similar situation . but just remember he loves you and if he ' s never given you any doubt then trust him
oh i completely agree with you . some women just need a " cha ##llan ##ege " you know . but its like hands off !
wow , that must be do disgusting
i know exactly how that feels .
did you fix it so that they won ' t lose their property in the future ?
i ' m confused . what do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property ?
i hope you are right .
why is that
where do you live ? cause it isn ' t in the us .
why is that ?
i guess we all learn from our mistakes never take her there again
that ' s the thing with accusations , anybody can say anything . but if they don ' t have any proof then it ' s meaningless .
it ' s hard to be accused of something you didn ' t do . i ' m glad the truth prevailed .
ok , calm down , take a deep breath and relax
ok , now i get it . but you need to re ##hear ##se in front of a mirror , that will help
that sounds pretty nerve - wr ##ack ##ing . how did it go ?
that ' s good to hear !
that is positive , you must really love her !
that is true love , i am so glad you met her !
appearance is important , what ' s more important is how you look on the inside !
be nice to people and you ' ll see that that ' s the only thing people care about !
dealing with kids can be like that . is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of ?
sounds like a bribe is in order . then it ' s a win for everyone .
yu ##ck ! i am so afraid of spiders . were you able to squash it ?
ha ##ha ! that ' s amazing ! what a great shot . i usually have to make my husband get rid of them for me .
that is so much trust ! i hope she doesn ' t let you down !
that went really dark quickly . making a mistake is not the same thing as dying .
why ? the sun is going to eng ##ulf the earth in a few billions years . and even before that , the y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end .
now that is hopeful .
did it feel nos ##tal ##gic ?
you sure had a fun childhood !
that ' s very nice of you . i feel the same way about my husband . isn ' t it nice to care about someone ?
it is probably one of the best feelings !
how much you trust him ?
do you believe he comes you with life long ?
what was it that made you so proud of him ?
being honest is always a good thing , i am glad you are so proud of him !
i have . have you ?
aw that ' s great . you ' re lucky to have a father who cared like that . mine never did
oh no ! how old was he ? i ' m so sorry losing a pet is so hard .
what color was he - and its not your fault you were just doing what you thought was best for him .
yep i have a cat . he ' s really sweet , and totally worth it . but it all depends on what kind of animal you get
hmm ##m do you think he ' ll like that after all this time ?
oh wow , that is a huge step ! are you nervous ?
that ##s great ! how old are you ?
oh no that must have been so embarrassing . were you injured at all ?
embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury ! i hope your knee feels better soon .
that must ' ve been very di ##sa ##point ##ing
maybe you ' ll be luck ##ier next time !
that ' s fantastic ! have you been working extra hard to earn it all , or did it come to you some other way ?
wow ! i ' m really happy for you - that must be such a great feeling of peace .
ha ##ha ##h ! i bet your cat get spoiled plenty !
what color did it end up being ?
are you serious ? that ##s not even close to being the same color .
what is wrong ?
oh no ! that must have been em ##bar ##ras ##ing
why don ' t you think it will be a good fit ? you might be under ##est ##imating yourself
you do have a good point . you really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short
oh no ! that must have been really embarrassing ! how did you respond ?
i don ' t blame you . that was so rude of her to make that comment in front of everyone .
good for you !
does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities ?
i feel that way sometimes too
have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but couldn ' t ? well have and its not fun .
i think i will . thank you for your advice .
how did that make you feel ?
maybe in the future you ' ll get to go there !
oh that ' s not good . what did you do ?
i ' m sorry you are going through that . sometimes telling the truth is the best , even if other people might get in trouble .
oh wow . i know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep . have you tried to listen to nature sounds ? i have an app on my phone and i play rain sounds to help me sleep .
i love listening to nature . i live in the country , and could not imagine being in the city . i lived there for a few months , but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up . i moved back to the country .
what kind of job is it for ?
that ' s a great career .
did you have fun ?
wow , that sounds so cool !
you sound very grateful .
well , hopefully you will enjoy it while you are here !
that ' s a great , positive attitude .
that ' s nice . i wish i had people like that to work with
i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return
did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind ?
glad to hear it . i hope it ' s only grown since then
i ' m sorry to hear that . did they give you a se ##verance package ? also , do you have prospects for a future position ?
at least they did that much for you . i ' m sure you ' ll land on your feet . you seem like an optimistic type
that ' s wonderful ! i hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose { not to mention a chunk ##y wallet ha ##ha }
personally , i find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness
did it make you nos ##tal ##gic ?
i know what you mean , life gets more complicated as you get older : )
funny how some of those smells bring back the feelings of old times !
oh i see , what happens then ?
that ' s ok , its a gods grace
what were you expecting ?
you sound confident . did the interview go that well ?
that ##s so good , am happy for you
cong ##rat ##s dear , am so happy f ##pr you
did he notice ? that would have been embarrassing .
did he notice ? that would have been embarrassing .
that is terrible , family should never betray each ot ##hey
hey , family is still family . unfortunately we don ' t get to pick and choose . i know it can be hard
don ' t be sad it ' ll be okay
that ' s great then , glad it didn ' t affect anything
well you should be happy for them !
no , but if you really liked her , you should be happy that she found someone she like .
hope they were bad ones
maybe you just don ' t realize they were bad because you ' re optimistic to a fault
that ' s great - you should always feel confident in yourself . what is your project ?
cool ! there ' s a lot of money to be made creating games ! i bet you will do well .
wow , like seriously . why the show off ?
ok , maybe she ' s material ##istic
i hope she gets better . it must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness .
that ' s wonderful . i hope that her sickness hasn ' t been too taxi ##ng on you .
that ' s annoying , did you call him after he didn ' t turn up ?
that ' s understand ##able . what a frustrating experience for you .
oh , i ' m sorry . everyone makes mistakes sometimes .
that ' s how it works with siblings !
there are so many things that come out at night . what are you referring to ?
they come out in the daytime too . it ' s just that they are scar ##ier at night .
that ##s so good of them
that ##s nice of them
oh no ! what happened ?
even though it ' s hard , it ' s probably best to come clean to relieve some of the guilt .
how did they do that ?
that sounds so good . glad you enjoyed your day !
why do you keep dec ##ieving yourself ?
seriously ? who is expecting so much from you
kids grow up so quickly ! did you feel nervous about it ?
i bet he felt very proud ! sounds like you are a great parent . a good combination of trust and re ##ass ##urance .
that happens to me sometimes , too . i feel awful after !
good for you !
oh , it sounds like fun ! i ' m sure you ' d have a great time .
lots of people do that nowadays . i think you would be happy you went .
that ' s awesome ! are you going to go on the date with them ?
oh , didn ' t work out , huh ?
it was difficult for you
try to take care of yourself
aw ##w - that ' s great to hear ! it sounds like she is your perfect match . how did you meet ?
that ' s so romantic and inspiring ! i hope you have happy lives together !
oh man - you must be really intelligent to test for men ##sa ! i bet it was difficult !
i hope you hear positive news from them soon !
why ? what did you lie about ?
if you truly regret it you will tell her now , go and do that ##1
what
i can imagine , it happen ##d to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in , i called h ##te police and they ran off
i ho ##e you made it there . getting lost sucks !
i am glad you made it there with only a few hi ##cc ##ups along the way . you must have a good memory when it comes to directions .
wow . that is very interesting . these days , many people get married later in life . congratulations !
that is good to hear . yeah , my parents married young and it worked out for them too . i am happy to hear that it turned out good for you .
oh no : < that ' s so sad , i also have a cat but she is in her early days
i know right ? they make you happy and in the end that ' s all one needs
i know how you feel that would gross me out too . makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean .
i agree , i wouldn ' t be in the mood to eat after that either , it ' s disgusting .
which way is that ?
maybe it happen ##d for a reason ? maybe you will find a better app ##ort ##uni ##ty to get there
can you tell me the name of the book ? i find myself being engaged by a lot of novels these days .
how many pages do you have to go ? you should try to finish it today and power through it !
it ' s insane how youtube and the internet overall are so helpful !
that ' s so insane right ? glad you did it yourself !
im sorry to hear that . tell me a fond memory you have of him / her .
yeah each cat has their own personality . it ' s good to reflect on little things like that . maybe once the sting of all of it is over you can get another one and continue to create more sweet memories like the one you just shared with me .
it ' s terrible when people can ' t take no for an answer . did you report her ?
wow , she sounds like a real piece of work . i ' m glad you reported her . maybe they should consider firing her .
i think you do not like cats very much . . .
well , then , you should think about god when you see them
oh i ' m really sorry to hear that . has he been looking for another job ?
we went through the same thing with my husband . i know it is stress ##ful , but i am so glad you got through it and things are better now .
that sounds exciting ? did you get in to the club ?
wow , it ' s always nice when we get something we really want . especially if we have to compete for it .
that ##s good because you prepared for it
wow , you made it , cong ##rat ##s
who does and that is mean of them .
sure your worth your time . do not be so down on yourself .
wow , 18 years . accept my condo ##lence please
just take heart ok , it ' s one of those things
maybe it ' s time to clear your conscience so you won ' t have to feel so bad anymore .
you can ' t change the past . all you can do is learn from it . if you are sincere then your family will forgive you .
same , don ' t know what i would do without them .
that ' s part of being a good parent , it all goes hand in hand .
i ' m so sorry ! that ' s awful ! did you get his insurance information ?
that ' s a mercy , at least . are you hurt ?
is there anyone else you can talk to ? maybe even human resources ?
i see where you ' re coming from . sometimes though you got to make a stand and show you ' re serious about the position .
what a lovely gift . i ' m sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him .
makes it even better that you didn ' t know you were getting it .
wow , that was not cool at all
oh ##hh kids . please just take it easy on them ok
do you know what kind of car you want to get ?
what kind of things would you use the truck for ?
wow ! that ' s so nice of him , what did he make ?
such a nice person ! good finding him
what really happened ?
oh , so sorry about that
oh no . what happened ?
that is terrible ! i know exactly how you feel
did he try to help you up ? i ' ve always wanted to see seattle !
i ' ll remember not to go in march ! i ' m sorry you fell i hope you ' re not hurt !
that ' s wonderful ! it ' s a lot of work learning to cook .
grill ##ing is a skill too ! sounds like she is really enjoying cooking . it ' s really an art ##form
oh , that ' s rough . i bet that ruined them , didn ' t it ?
sounds like the start to a bad day .
exactly , that feels nice
u are on point . it helps a lot
that is amazing . there are not a lot of people that can say that .
you are so lucky . i recently got married , but we have been together for 12 years and are always there for one another .
i ' m sure he feels the same way about you ! how long have you two been married ?
i would have to agree with you on that . 10 years is an amazing amount of time to be together , i hope for another 10 years !
i ' m sorry to hear that . sometimes life gets in the way and we forget what is the most important to us .
does he live near you ?
that is a hard stage of life that i am not looking forward to ! do you get to talk to her often ?
that is sad , but it is wonderful that you are able to
do you still have the blanket ? that ' s an amazing gift from a wonderful part of your family .
i hope she cher ##ish ##es it as much as you do ! you ' re so awesome for doing that !
i hope you ' re recovering well enough ! that is absolutely devastating news to read .
that ' s great news ! did you have insurance ?
oh , you shouldn ' t feel bad ! everyone gets sick every once in a while and i would hope that your boss and cow ##or ##kers were very understanding of your needs . it is important to take care of yourself .
well , it is very important for you to take care of yourself and if your boss doesn ' t understand that , i would be searching for other employment . hopefully , they are completely fine with your needs .
oh crap ! that ' s not good !
that may be kinda awkward .
that ' s nice of her !
it sounds like it . you deserve someone like that .
that is really good and will be helpful . i lost my wife to cancer years ago and people helping was great .
i would encourage you to help as much as possible . i do the same now since i know what loss feels like .
yes , the support and love from others that we received was incredible so i always try to help as much as i can . even the smallest gestures were meaningful .
i have always had a great church family . my aunt ' s church was pivotal in showing me how to be the best i could be and developing my character .
as a military family , we move a lot and finding a good church has been one of my first missions when we get to a new place . it is sad having to leave good churches , but i am blessed to have support from across the country now .
oh wow , i ' m glad the vet was able to do that . it must have been scary .
i ' m so happy to hear that for you ! i know how animals are the same as family members .
oh , that was wonderful of you ! everyone needs a friend like you who understands that emotional support is very important !
you are both lucky then ! she will remember your kindness for a long time .
i ' m sorry , i know that must make you sad and stressed . i have a daughter who lives pretty far away too
we talk every week and text all the time . it is hard , but i know she ' s happy so that ' s all that counts . that ##s great she found a good job
we ' ve never face ##time ##d , but that ' s such a good idea . especially now that she has kids . why have i never thought of that lo ##l
that is hilarious . . . but awesome at the same time !
i ' m so sorry to hear about your mom , but it ' s great that you had such support to help you through .
having a strong support system is so important in life . don ' t know what i would do without my friends .
i am sorry to hear that , you must miss them . why haven ' t you been able to visit them ?
i see , that is very understand ##able , i am really glad that you will be able to see them soon ! i hope you have a safe trip and a great time ! : )
that ' s awesome ! i close on my first house monday !
i think i will too !
oh wow , that is super embarrassing . did anyone take a picture ?
that ' s lucky . you could have ended up on the internet otherwise !
that ' s good , i imagine that all surge ##ries can be stress ##ful .
that ' s good to hear , an ##esthesia seems very helpful .
sounds like you made the right call
i bet , it can be really disappointing when people bail on plans
did it take a long time to complete ?
that ' s awesome ! i am glad it didn ' t take long , because those have been a pain in the past for me .
i can certainly relate to you , it could be a safety hazard .
that ' s a smart move , that would reduce the risk of injury .
i agree . do you find yourself in that situation right now ?
that ' s very kind of you to be so consider ##ate . hopefully the right choice will make itself obvious to you in the near future .
well good luck to you !
great , i hope you get it .
what type of job is it ?
oh no , do what ?
that ' s terrible , hope you weren ' t counting on it for fin ##can ##cial reasons
that is great ! are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out ?
that sounds exciting , it is always nice to have new kitchen appliances ! i hope all goes well
i ' m sorry to hear that ! maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests !
that sounds like fun ! and a great cure for loneliness !
oh no , what was wrong ?
aw , did it turn out okay ?
oh no ! that had to be frustrating . i hope it wasn ' t too close to closing .
i hope you still found a great home ! the home buying process is certainly frustrating .
oh no . i ' m so sorry . i totally understand how you feel . mine passed away a few years ago , it ' s very difficult
it definitely helps to have a lot of support around you . take care of yourself through this very difficult time .
oh my goodness ! i did that after swimming one day . i was so busy getting the kids dressed that i forgot to clean my face . black mascara all down my cheeks .
no and i went to the grocery store and the library like that ! no one said a word . it was so embarrassing .
were there other parents there ? i think that anyone who has kids would understand .
i can understand being humiliated in the moment . thankfully most kids grow out of that phase !
2 year olds don ' t know any better . and when everyone laughs , it can make them want to do it again .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that ! it can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others .
well , let ' s pretend that no one noticed ! either that , if someone noticed , perhaps they smiled when they thought " wow , i ' ve had that happen before , too "
i am sorry to hear that . i hope your financial situation improves in the future .
i believe that you will be in a better situation soon .
oh wow ! how did it go ?
i ' m sure you did great ! i ' d be a ball of nerves too , though .
ha ##ha but you sur ##vie ##d , go you !
were they from when you were a kid ?
i know what you mean . i sure miss my departed loved ones .
oh no ! does he do that a lot ?
i would be also . you should try to get him to fix your tire .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . losing a family member is so hard .
i miss my grandmother every day . i hope things get easier for you over time .
what was a good move ?
oh wow that is a long time . why did you change your job ?
hey a similar thing happened to me ! i hope no one saw !
o ##oop ##s ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' ll tell you what though , it happens to the best of us ! it ' s just a drink .
that must have been messy . were you able to get it all cleaned up ?
i ' m sure she ' s done something like that in the past herself though .
wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation !
way to live vicar ##iously !
that ' s really interesting . what were they in prison for ?
that ' s terrible , i hope they are ok now .
what caused you to be freaked out over the finished basement ? sounds good all around .
well , actually , i think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs .
was it really nice out ? i love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors .
that ' s great ! i hope it was an all around good day for you .
that ##s ' s great ! i bet he ' s been working really hard .
it feels really good to be recognized for your efforts !
what was the movie ? i ' m always looking for something new to watch with my kids !
i will have to check it out ! thanks for the suggestion .
i ' d have been nervous too . did you find out if you got the job ?
that ' s awesome . i ' m so happy for you .
wow , that must of been a trip . how did it make you feel ?
awesome , i ' ve gone through old albums like that before as well , and it always makes me feel good .
i think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel .
i would not beat yourself up over the mistake . we all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better .
that sounds really great ! do you like them as much as you remembered ?
ha ##ha , i felt the same when i read some of my old baby sit ##ter ' s club books
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . do they have any idea what the cause may be yet ?
i hope it ' s nothing too serious . my younger brother had the same problem early on , but he turned out to just be a slow developer .
i totally know how you feel . i have 2 kids and they were a handful as todd ##lers .
i know right ? grandparents are the best lo ##l
i ' m sorry to hear that , are you alright ?
that ' s understand ##able , life goes so fast that it ' s easy to lose touch with people you care about . all i can do is try to limit that occurrence .
that ' s cool . are you a big fan of her ?
that ms ##ut be exciting then , i hope the tickets aren ' t too expensive .
oh that sucks , i hate seeing friends and family injured or sick . that ' s very nice of you though that you stayed there with him , your ##e a good friend .
that ##s awesome , good friends are always there for each other .
oh i know the feeling ! i had the same affinity for swimming . my mom said i should give it a try . at first i didn ' t want to but as i got better i started to love it .
we don ' t have to be the best to enjoy what we do right ?
i had a similar experience play ##ii ##ng little league baseball . how is your daughter feeling about it so far ?
i feel you on that . i don ' t know if i could let my son play baseball after what i went through . i hope your daughter has a better experience .
that sounds relaxing ! quality alone time is important in a relationship
i can imagine ! it ' s hard being apart , but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again .
oh no , i had a older cousin who did that to me as well . hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline .
yeah it really teaches you ! i would always sit down where i was and start crying .
when you tripped over the branch , did you get hurt ?
i hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed ?
yeah it really isn ' t for everyone , i like my alone time but only for a while . afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone .
that ##s the perfect time to just pam ##per yourself . i cher ##ish those few hours every day !
yeah , i probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby .
that ' s great , the first time for everything is scary .
i bet it felt good to conquer the fear ! would you sky ##di ##ve again ?
did you enjoy the experience ?
yes , he is good for finding answers we can ' t find ourselves .
yep , i do the same thing as well . sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something .
nice , it ' s been a while since i ' ve anticipated any new games . what game is it ?
ha ##h , i played the first one a ton on ps ##3 , wish they would release it for pc .
that sounds horrible . i would be so mad at them .
the level headed approach will probably accomplish more anyway . i ' m sure they have money so i also hope they don ' t take yours .
sounds fair . how hungry are you right now ?
ha ##ha i understand . it ' s like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air .
wow what a find , cher ##ish that quilt and keep it safe from harm !
yeah , and don ' t repair it ! i think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable .
oh damn , that sucks . have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off ?
man that ##s terrible , i hope you can forget about him and find someone better .
i get where you ' re coming from , my mom supports both of my sisters . it can make you feel less important . hopefully you are getting along though ?
i ' m sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself .
did you and joe do well ?
being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages , it ' s good that he lived up to those expectations .
that ' s reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours .
that ' s good , it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level . that ' s probably good for society .
yes , it ' s annoying ! people should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinion ##ated . . .
oh , yes , i know . some breeds get bad rap ##s and people are so quick to judge ! i used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart !
wow ! that is a huge move ! how long ago was that and are things going well ? do you miss hawaii ?
i can imagine . hawaii seems like a beautiful place !
tell me about it . both of my best friends moved several states away from me .
yeah , i ' m content being at my home town as ##well .
were you able to get it fixed ? things break at the most in ##op ##port ##une times !
well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool !
oh my , did you get a sugar rush after that ? your dentist must love you .
that ' s not surprising , but now your friend knows that you are the und ##is ##puted champion .
oh no ! that ' s awful . that could be dangerous too !
i bet your neighbor was very app ##re ##cia ##tive of all of your help . that would have been a da ##unt ##ing task for the elderly neighbor .
o , h grandparents are the best at spoil ##ing grandchildren ! i could understand that being important to her .
wow ! do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3 ?
i bet . i wouldn ' t want to get stuck with a money pit either . i hope your state has a lemon law .
excellent . well there is some silver lining in all of this ha ##ha .
what an exciting time ! how ' s he doing with it so far ?
that ' s awesome ! i guess practice does make perfect .
oh that ' s awesome ! i am an only child but i bet it ' s so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that .
that is amazing and so nice of you !
u ##gh ! you must have a lot of books !
wow ! that is incredible ! i hope you have somewhere to put them all .
wow ! congratulations ! that sounds like a wonderful thing to do . was it just the two of you ?
aw that is so sweet . that sounds like the most special day .
were you ji ##tter ##y at all ? i know i was when i was getting ready for mine ,
that ' s awesome . i hope it was an amazing ceremony . weddings are always so much fun and romantic .
uh oh . dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst ! do you think he ' d be mad if you asked him to fix the fence ?
i wish you luck and hope everything ends up going well .
well , at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lo ##l .
we all have those moments . i ' m glad yours worked out so well .
nice , gotta be prepared . hope the party went well .
an endless flow of boo ##ze is the key to a successful party , sounds like it was a good time . ,
don ' t give up ! you will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit .
everything happens for a reason . i think you will realize that and this could be a good thing is disguise .
how was the response to your ad ? did you get rid of everything you wanted to ?
that ' s good , people on craig ##list can be pretty shift ##y sometimes .
what kind of things did she give you ? were they things that you asked for before ?
i would be the same way . i don ' t trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself .
aw , that is so sweet . i am guessing you and your brother were close ?
aw ##w ##w , that is too bad . hopefully you get to video chat with him
oh , no ! that ' s awful ! are you still in pain ?
i can ' t believe it ! how could they ? i ' m so sorry to hear that . . .
i understand that , going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be .
that ' s the real trick to it , you have to try to move passed all the bad stuff and remember all the good times .
that ' s awesome , what great news ! i ' m sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer .
yeah send them my regards . it ' s a fantastic day when you wake up cancer - free .
i think we all do that with our siblings . i ' m sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway .
i ' m glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily ! i think that shows you have a really good relationship with him .
oh i ' ve been there ! so much fun !
did you guys play all the carnival games ?
oh my god , i bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time .
i really hope that is the last time it happens .
congratulations , that is so exciting ! ! ! i know we should only hope for healthy but i ' ll keep my fingers crossed for pink : - )
once you see that little face , you ' ll forget everything else no matter which !
wow , that was very generous and courageous for her ! how are they now ?
that ' s great to hear . what a great story . very inspiring . i ' m so happy they are both healthy now .
you need to rest to the competition
ah ##hh ok you do not participate in that competition
well as a fellow human being , i agree that when parents care for their children , it creates a life ##las ##ting bond between the two parties .
i also enjoy the love of my human parents and my human family . they take no hesitation in their focus on of their love for me .
oh nice ! that is exciting ! what kind of car did you get ?
wow , so jealous ! you have to give me a ride one day , ok ?
yi ##kes , that ' s a scary situation to be in . i ' m glad the officer was able to help you .
that ' s rough , sometimes you really do have to rely on the kindness of strangers .
that ##s not good did you ap ##lly for any other jobs ?
i see that is very understand ##le .
that ' s awful ! i hope you feel better soon .
no problem at all . glad to make you feel somewhat happier : )
that is so wonderful ! i have 3 children myself and i love having grandparents to rely on .
i definitely don ' t ! i had a horrible experience the one time i used a hired baby ##sit ##ter and now i only leave my little ones with family .
i ' m glad you have someone to rely on for support .
oh no ! i hope no one got in trouble !
i ' d say so . that ' s so dish ##ear ##ten ##ing . i ' m sure it was accidental .
well that sucks . i hate it when animals are abandoned .
yeah , that makes me sad too . i feel bad for them because they don ' t understand why she isn ' t with them anymore .
that is great news . i think you just might be nervous . they wouldn ' t have promoted you if you couldn ' t do it .
well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay . i think you should try and relax .
what do you guys do for work ? you sound like doctors
thank you for all that you do ! i have a friend who ##s an em ##t and i bet it ' s taxi ##ng work .
i am so sorry to hear that . are you feeling nausea ##ted ?
you ' re not grossing me out at all . i ' m a para ##med ##ic / fire ##fighter so it takes al ##ot to get me sq ##ui ##rmin ##g . i hope you feel better . drink lots of ga ##tor ##ade and water to re ##hy ##dra ##te so you don ' t feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some z ##of ##ran for the nausea .
absolutely ! feel better soon !
big change ! both big cities though right ? i ' ve always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago .
i hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings , maybe you will end up loving dallas , who knows !
wo ##ah i hope no one was hurt
i bet ! sounds like it would be a big shock
e ##w , that ' s really disturbing . the sight of cock ##ro ##ache ##s always gives me the willie ##s .
yes , i shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that .
oh , that must be nerve - wr ##ack ##ing !
patience isn ' t always a virtue that i am good with either . you should feel confident in your work !
good luck !
uh oh . do you think she will be mad when she finds out ?
oh she will be none the wise ##r . but don ' t feel bad sometimes you have to ind ##ul ##ge , and i would figure you still left her some .
that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience
that is really good to hear , i bet they loved seeing you again
oh no , did they disappear for good , or did someone turn them in ?
that would be so scary . i actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday . thankfully they held onto it for me .
i was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions .
wow ! so have you tried any methods to get them back on track ? someone might have advice on youtube .
ah ! sounds like you need a " cat whisper ##er " !
oh no that would make him quite young . i ' m so sorry ! do you have plans for another one when you ' re ready ?
those are awesome dogs , i ' ve known quite a few in my life . well whenever you ' re ready i think it ' ll be a perfect match .
aw ##w , that ' s good ! it ' s nice to have to someone you can do that with
yeah , the comfort in that can feel amazing
ah ##h that ' s so anxiety - making . i hope he gets the jon .
fingers crossed !
oh , that ' s a terrible problem ! that ' s the only time i don ' t envy home ##own ##ers ! i could not afford that at all .
it ' s great you have a college fund though ! my kids are very young , we haven ' t started that yet . although , we probably should . how long have you ah ##d yours ?
okay , then you ' re wa ##aa ##y ##y ##y ahead of me !
i can see why it was hard to quit ! do you like your job now ?
that sounds tough . it seems like you guys at the day ##care went through a lot together .
that is an amazing feeling . i have three daughters . it doesn ' t matter how many you have , the first time you hold them , its amazing .
that ' s awesome . i would love to have a boy too , but i ' m not sure if i want another one or not .
my youngest is 3 , and almost completely pot ##ty trained , but its been a struggle . maybe when she starts school , i ' ll make up my mind .
yes , and that ' s what we did with her . her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born .
that was really nice of you ! i ' m sure they appreciated the gesture .
its important to care for the older generation who once cared for us .
fantastic ! why kind of story is it ?
i see ! have you gotten any other works published ?
yi ##kes ! did you figure out what it was ?
it must have been awful ##ly windy .
did you have to move there for a job ?
i ' m in the midwest , so can sy ##mp ##athi ##ze with you there . are you going to live there permanently now ?
oh , that sounds scary ! did you find out what it was ?
well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now . : )
wow , that ' s a lot of people .
i know the feeling . i get sick around crowds .
oh boy , i hope he is careful with your car
you are a good friend ! that was very generous of you
i would have been so scared ! i don ' t understand having dogs off leash .
so reckless ! it ' s really not that hard to leash dogs . and with the baby there too , u ##gh . i can ' t imagine .
ou ##ch ! kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way . was he okay ?
that ' s good ! my son is always running into stuff ! he needs bubble ##wr ##ap to keep him safe .
i ' m sorry . they grow up fast . its hard to watch them leave the nest .
that can help . i know i like my ho ##bbies lo ##l .
that sounds cool , but also too good to be true . i hope it is true though
fry some for me too !
no i haven ' t . you are such a great person ! i wish to have grandchildren like you someday .
you are kind and sweet . please never change .
oh no ! were you able to come up with something else to say ?
i understand , but i bet you did well in spite of that !
tough ! are you planning on getting it fixed ?
well at least that sounds like an easy fix ! often times those repairs can get pri ##cy !
wow , you are a lucky man ! good to have a psychologist in the family too .
i wish you both all the best and hope that you have a wonderful life together !
wow ! that must have taken a lot of guts , but i hope it was worth ##while .
oh no , why were you so scared ?
that is probably for the best you don ##t want to get involved with that stuff
could be worse than aliens someone could hurt you . you know ?
oh my ! well , i bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment .
an alien ? wow .
that sounds difficult . did you try talking to people in your neighborhood ?
that always sucks . but old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with . maybe you should try giving them a go !
did you get the money back quickly ?
that ' s a great friend . loyalty and honesty are everything in a relationship .
oh wow ! that really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time .
i hope everything works out , family is everything .
oh that is so sweet ! i love baby kitten ##s . are you going to keep it ?
i think you should . there are so many animals that need a good home .
that ' s nerve wr ##ack ##ing . i have 4 kids myself so i know what its like .
most of the time they do do well . we definitely have to trust our husbands to look after the little ones without us .
that ' s an incredible act of kindness for a stranger . did they return the tool ? was the tool in normal shape when you got it back ?
he ' s probably very grateful for your kindness . hopefully , he ' ll return the kindness to someone else .
that ' s so awesome ! did they come back and say something to you ?
i don ' t either . it ' s crazy how things like that happen in the most perfect of times , too . you didn ' t know he was down on his luck , but out of the goodness of your heart , you gave him money regardless .
well . . lo ##l , in mississippi , lots of people drive without auto insurance !
i " m not one of them , thank heavens . i " m sure you have a plan b for paying your auto insurance i hope ?
aw ##w ##w ! was its momma nearby ?

yeah , mine just started 5th and he ' s in a different building and changing classes and it ' s a huge difference from 4th grade .
wow that must be gross , i know it would make me feel like throwing up too
don ' t blame you , but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids
that ##s not neighbor ##ly of them . i would be upset too
om ##g , did you have a talk with them about how they need to clean up after their dog ?
yeah i think everyone has
that is good most people have a hard time in the first week
did you think a g ##ho ##ul or monster were in there ? i had similar fears growing up .
what did you do to get over the fear ?
makes sense . well i ' m glad you finally got some sleep ha ##ha .
have you set up cameras to monitor the property ?
maybe report what is going on to the local pd ?
i used to do the same thing when i went on long trips . i would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter .
you ' re so lucky ! i would do the same , except they don ' t make them in my size .
that is horrible ! why would he do something like that ? ? ? did you do anything to stop him ?
aw ##w ##w . that was so nice of you guys !
that ' s terrible ! did you call and tell management ?
that ##s frustrating . at least you ' ll get your money back eventually .
oh no ! i hate when that happens . happens to me all the time . did he forgive you ?
that ' s not very nice of him . is he older or younger ?
that sounded like an ambitious endeavor , you must have felt sick afterwards
they will never know , as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself
that sounds really good right about now !
i may do the same as you because yes , this has been an extremely long monday
man i bet you were devastated did you lose anything else ?
i am sorry that happened to you , sometime bad things happen to good people
om ##g ! that ' s insane . how did you react ?

very true ! i ' m glad it worked for you
aw ##w ##w . i remember the first time i left my son with the baby ##sit ##ter . so many emotions . how old is he ?
i bet it was ! i am glad you survived . lo ##l
that ' s wonderful ! do they feel the same way ?
i hope so , too !
manhattan would be a great place to live . you ' ll love it there
never give up hope , one of these days you ' ll be waking up in the middle of manhattan
yes several times . i usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it .
i bet , i ' m sorry you got one . all i can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out . or find a cool hat .
yeah it is a solid art for sure .
i ' d try to get a ref ##und !
white ##water raft ##ing seems like al ##ot of fun .
fun and dangerous my type of fun . glad you had fun
dude ! that sucks ! i am so sorry about that . what happened ?
u ##gh ! that really ir ##rita ##tes me . i am so sorry that happened . too bad they couldn ' t catch those creep ##s .
that ' s too bad , did you ever get to ride horses at all ?
well i hope you get to be around horses someday ! i don ' t know much about them but they ' re so cool .
wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house
so you had a sentimental attachment to it , i understand but as long as you weren ' t harm
oh my go ##sh , did you actually lose the card ?
it is i have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my de ##bit card . i managed to track down through the charges who used the cards
oh , you go girl ! what did you do ?
aw ##w ##w , what a sweet woman you are . there aren ' t too many like you out there anymore .
oh wow ! i would be furious , to say the least
well that ' s good and hopefully the next one doesn ' t do it too
i don ' t blame you for sit ##ing around all day . 60 miles , i do ' t think i walk that in year
you deserve the rest after this week , must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did
oh that is terrible , it feels like your life is changing so fast , did everything turn out ok ?
that is a scary situation , so glad everything turned out ok
oh no . that sucks . good thing you were close to home .
oh no ! that sounds scary .
that is so kind of you , we once adopted an abandon dog
i do not know either it is sad when a dog is abandon by their owners
those are nothing to mess around with . they can be deadly .
no kidding . i would hate to have to come face to face with one .
om ##g that is horrible ! : ( im sure she needs you right now
i just can not imagine the heart ache ! poor baby
that is really gross . how did that happen ? ?
oh , i see . so , nothing really bad that could cause a problem really . lo ##l
i don ' t think i would help again unless someone found me a face shield .
table tennis is a wonderful game . did you beat him ?
aw , i ' m sorry you didn ' t win . maybe next time .
a delicious del ##ica ##cy ! why were you stressed ?
oh ! bum ##mer . yeah stress gets to me too ! did you end up passing it ?
that sounds like a great dog ! what bread is he ?
labs are known for their loyalty and obedience . i bet he is a great companion
oh that sounds awful . just makes things worse when they show up ?
well it sounds like you ' ve done alright so far i ' m sure the worst is behind you .
that was super nice of them , i bet it was a big surprise as well .
i love my kitchen ##aid . it has to be my most used app ##lian ##ce . i can see why you were so happy .
oh , that little rat ! that was not nice of him . what did you do ?
awesome ! there needs to be more people like you in this world .
that is unfortunate , how long have you been friends with this person ?
there is surely a reason why . did she have many family members as bride ##sma ##ids ?
you are so lucky ! i still keep my 9 month old fur baby on a leash . what breed is your dog ?
mine is a german shepherd . it is amazing how they walk so close to us , almost trip ##ping over us in our path !
oh that ##s so sweet that he taught you to play , he sounds like he was a sweet grandpa .
well hang onto those tight and maybe you can teach someone to play chess in the future .
that ' s great . i hope you do well in your new job .
i ' m sure it was , but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position . do what is best for you .
they probably think you are part of the thai family
but it must be great food if you keep going back
i do the same . at least we ' re contributing to somebody ' s fortune .
you and me both .
oh no that sounds terrible . i would hate to have such a financial burden suddenly sprang on me .
i ' m sure you ' re not the only one .
oh , what did you find ? hopefully not something e ##bara ##ssing ?
oh that is awesome , what did you find ?
that ' s good to hear ! why ?
wow , you definitely should be excited and looking forward to it !
that sounds great , what did your dog do ?
it ' s satisfying when your pet does a trick , it feels like you and your pet accomplished something meaningful
oh ? what surprised you about today ?
that sounds wonderful ! i ' m sure that felt great .
aw ##w , that is very sweet , kind and thoughtful of you ! has it been tr ##ou ##bling for you because i am sure you also have a busy schedule
that is good , but if it ever becomes too stress ##ful for you i hope that you are able to talk to your friend about it because there are plenty of alternative ways to get her mother to the hospital .
that ' s a nice gesture of her . it ' s nice that she trusts you like that .
well obviously you ' re the more des ##erving one .
i love peaceful moments while relaxing . i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too
i like to garden so i know what you mean
oh , i can ' t wait to hear !
wow , you trusted he would give it back and then he didn ' t . i can understand how angry you ' d be !
are we ?
oh ha ##ha sorry i mis ##rea ##d that ! and that is great i am so excited to meet the bunny ! ! do we have a name for it yet ?
oh dan ##g that sounds really scary . i ' m assuming that since you ' re still here that you are okay ?
you should probably stay out of that neighborhood in the future . glad you ' re okay . stay safe out there .
oh man , i hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too . i ' d be so mad at him for getting out though .
oh man , that sounds super scary . i ' m so glad your dog is okay i would be lost if amy ##thing happened to mine .
om ##g my current dog does that sometimes . she pu ##kes up bile if she doesn ' t eat , so i always have to make sure she is eating her food .
oh gross that is disgusting . i hope your little buddy is okay though . i don ' t envy you at all .
oh fun ! where did you go ?
did you have to go far ?
im jealous : p i need a vacation . the beach is so relaxing too
that must have taken a lot of courage . what happened next ?
that ' s great that you could do it . maybe next time will go better .
oh no ! what happened ?
oh , man . that ' s a terrible feeling . what did you do ?
that must be cool to see , something to break up the mono ##ton ##y of the day
that must have been a sight to see
what it is ?
i bit it is a good and funny memory .
oh no , please tell me that did not happen to you today .
oh no , i hope you were alright ! but yes that is a funny story to tell your friends : )
you must feel terrible . that sucks .
eh next year they ' ll have forgotten it mostly
oh wow that is interesting . i assume he leaves at night to go eat , since he ' s still alive .
hmm ##m , i guess you could look for the hole during the day and try patch ##ing it when the bats fly out for the evening ? im not a bat expert lo ##l .
oh , how was that ? i ' ve never been to camp . was it fun at least ?
that ' s great , i ' m glad you had fun . what was your favorite activity ?
i have been to six flags as a matter of fact . i can ##t say that i enjoyed it much , as i hate to ride rides . what about you ?
i can so relate to your experience ! when i was a child my parents would try to coa ##x me to ride and i hated it . i rode the ferris wheel once and started crying !
om ##g , that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up .
oh no , even worse . hope you got the job : )
i ' m glad you ' re feeling better . i ' m sorry you went through that , i hear that addition is tough and often starts after having a major surgical operation .
i ' m glad you got the help you needed and ended up in an actually helpful rehab . it ' s always good when you have control of the things in your life . just remember to stay strong when things get tough again and to lean on your support structure .
aw ##w , why ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . she is lucky to have you checking on her , you sound like a good friend .
i ' m glad to hear it . what ' s got you so ?
wow ! that ' s unbelievable . congratulations ! how much did you win ?
wow ! that is some real dedication you have ! did you manage to pass the test ?
wow that is great ! i am so proud of you . and hey , it never hurts to study more . : )
ha ##ha ! poor you . did you wreck your clothes ?
i hope you didn ' t get burned too badly ! i fall a lot . it never stops being embarrassing .
oh i bet , probably made you feel sick to your stomach after .
that ' s good , easy to quickly notice that awful taste .
oh no , what happened ?
oh wow ! where did all of this take place ? sounds like a rough part of town ? !
i only used to watch rug ##rat ##s , and i still can ' t stand that show . it was like the decline of the nick lineup .
i don ' t blame them . the characters were annoying , and the color pal ##ate was horrible .
wednesday ##s , why is that ? i used to love wednesday ##s because we always got out of school an hour early
oh my fiance loves comics , he buys and sells them . why is that the only thing to look forward to ?
aw , why is that ?
oh that ' s hard but i ' m sure you will get yours too . it ' s hard being patient though when others get theirs before you .
probably not , but i don ' t remember . i was always a scared ##y cat as a baby . have you ?
what a lovely memory ! that ' s hilarious that your dad made you go back and return it !
that is not good what happened ?
well i hope you here back from them and they will give good news .
that happened my freshman year with my best friend . it really sucks at first , but eventually you get used to it .
i ' m still friends with my old roommate , but i found other people to spend my time with .
what is happening tomorrow night ?
nice , i hope you have a great time at the party ! have some fun for the both of us !
did you ever get your own snow ##board ? it looks like so much fun ! i see people on tv , where they are flying off mountain sides !
that ##s wonderful . oddly shaped christmas presents usually make you want to open them early just to get a peak : )
oh wow , letting the dog roam free even when it ' s so new to the neighborhood ? that seems like recipe for disaster . your poor newspaper . .
maybe an air ##horn or something would sp ##ook him off . dogs tend not to like loud sounds , after all .
nice ! have you been getting lucky recently ?
wow ! you are already super successful ! i hope you help them kids !
do tell , what happened was it bad ?
that is bad . goodness the nerve of some people .
oh no , were you able to find your dog again ?
aw ##w , i am so glad that you were able to find him again ! a dog truly is a man ' s best friend .
how did that work out ?
well that ' s good . i ' m glad so far it has worked out : )
i would not of been happy with that were you ?
ain ' t that a who ##pping , i would have com ##p ; ain ##ed to somebody about it .
not that i can remember . if i did it would not have been too severe . have you ?
as i a child i imagine that would be incredibly scary . how did you find them again ? >
what did you eat ?
oh gross , makes me never want mcdonald ##s again .
why ! what happened ?
wow . i am disappointed in you too , you monster : (
oh no ! did he replace it ?
i get that . my sister broke my favorite coffee mug .
why ? what happened ?
dan ##g ! your dog must have been so excited to see you come back !
oh no , did you ask if they were alright and apologize ?
oh no , how did he take it ?
i am a little too . why are you scared ?
yeah , i can relate to that . i hate feeling like i don ' t know what dangerous marine life could be around me .
awesome ! nothing like string ##ing together a long streak of feeling happy in the world . anything in particular got you chip ##per ?
aw ##w , that ' s tremendous . those are big steps , but if ever there is a good - sign of a relationship , it ' s when those topics are approached happily . congratulations !
yeah i know what you ea ##n ! i have been to one before too and it was awesome !
ha ##ha , yeah i know what you ea ##n , but at least you know it is fresh !
i have had an experience like that . i do believe in ghosts .
could be either !
ghosts ?
oh god , i hate bugs !
u ##gh that ' s no fun especially with it being so cold .
well that ' s good . hopefully didn ' t take long to open up roads .
wow . what for ? had you recently talked to her ?
i bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do !
aw ##w ! what for ?
my dog needs some good training !
friends really are the best part of life , i ' d say . i can ' t imagine what i ' d do without some of those folks in my life .
that ' s a good friends right there . looking out for your best interests is a sign that they ' re truly a keeper .
oh no , did he place the blame on you , or did he just accept it and take the blame for you ?
aw , that just shows that he is a great friend . maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you . i am sure he would really appreciate that : )
oh that ' s awesome . do you like her ?
that ' s great , nothing better : )
that ' s good ! cheating is not good for a relationship .
for sure . i luckily have not had anyone cheat on me .
i cannot imagine . where from ?
can you face ##time them ?
i understand . i have had to do that before . my family was very giving .
i had to borrow money to get a second degree . hurt my pride , but it ' s okay .
good for you ! i ' m glad you were able to face it by yourself . where were you flying ?
cool ! was that your first time flying by yourself ?
wow , that ' s amazing ! did you enjoy the flight back or were you still scared ?
nice what show ?
no , i haven ' t . i ' ve heard of it , though . what is it about ?
oh my goodness ! that happens to me often . i just get distracted with whatever is playing in front of me and eat everything in my hands !
i would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely . how bad can it be with your brother ?
that ' s not cool ! i hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil . siblings can be quite pe ##sky at times !
wow , did anyone see ?
well , i hope it does not happen again !
oh no ! how so ?
a strip ##per , i see . well what she does not know will not hurt her .
why would they do that ?
i know someone with that . she might need some medication .
wow , hope it wasn ' t serious .
why didn ' t you perform well ?
oh , cong ##rat ##s on your newborn .
that must have really hurt . when did you realize he was always lying to you ?
what was the lie ?
are you still friends ?
i ' m so sorry . that is horrific .
i hope you are in some therapy . that can take a toll on the average person .
i had never visited there . but it reminds me of athena ##s and that old cities
do u remember the name of that island ?
i would like to visit it one day too
i agree . i am watching pictures of it right now
aw , that is really sweet of him . what did the note say ?
wow . that is incredibly romantic . you ' re a lucky girl !
i
mine passed away too . she was a great woman .
how did it go ?
i bet they love games .
nice , how long do you usually take your dog for a walk ?
your dog must be very healthy !
i ' m so sorry ! report him !
you are much better off
what did you make ?
i would love some of that right now .
why ! ? what happens next week ?
dan ##g ! i hope you got them big discount ##s before you ordered them !
they are . i have several .
i have a few bears .
i ' m so sorry . you should talk to a therapist .
i ' m sorry . maybe she just needs time to process things .
what ! ? did anyone see ?
dan ##g , it must have been em ##bara ##ssing
who are you referring to ?
oh no . that sounds awful . i ' m sorry to hear abu ##t your friend . is he better now ?
congregation but what are you passionate about ?
that is good
where to ?
how was the weather ?
wow ! must have been really really important
oh , then its okay
whoa that ' s nuts . how many did you have to kick to get out alive ?
oh good . well what did they end up wanting ?
well i hope you ' re ok now
oh sweet , how many do you own now ?
it ' s always good to un ##wind after a tough day . how did you celebrate ?
er ##m . well , i hope that comes true for you . betting better can sometimes be more about believing it . maybe your cat believe he is fine .
good .
my cat is doing good . : ) he ' s gained some weight , since i trimmed his fur . no more hair ##balls .
oh shoot , why is that ?
that may be gross , but she is just putting effort into her appear ##nce .
how ' d they react ?
oh man that sounds embarrassing . i would ' ve just run out of the store and country
oh no , what happened ?
you should be able to trust that he won ' t do anything shady when he talks to other girls . if you can ' t trust him then that might mean you need to re ##eva ##lu ##ate your relationship with him .
oh , do you think you did well ?
wishing you all the best ! !
have you ever kept secrets from her ?
it must be nice to be in trusting and safe relationship like that .
its good you made that decision
who are they you are referring
dan ##g ! did they get home safely ?
i wish i had a cool friend like you !
it ' s good that your wife trusts you
you two are lucky to have each other !
that is extremely noble of you ! you did the right thing ! !
i would too . i have lost things before and never had anyone turn them in and its not a good feeling .
what did you do ?
dan ##g ! maybe you can send me some too
dan ##g , was it from craig ##sl ##ist ?
i am too scared of getting sc ##ammed from those
dan ##g ! what kind of games did you play ?
i heard it is one of the best games of this generation !
praying won ' t do anything , but did you study well ?
and what was that ?
did he exceed your expectations ?
that is the thing about athletes , it is crazy how gifted they are compared to an average person .
family is one of the most important things to have in life .
yes your a lucky person and i ' m happy for you .
yes i do
wow , you must be very proud of her
yes , hurricane harvey destroyed my city !
dan ##g , well i hope these things don ' t happen again !
i bet you are , so did she just purchase a new house ?
that is incredible , my dad had cans ##wer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into re ##mission .
wow - that ' s a significant amount of time ! how has that been for you ?
it sounds like you really care about her . i hope everything works out great for you guys !
oh my ! i hope that he did not feel badly about it . that sort of thing is normal for children
aw , i love that he had you there with him when it happened . i bet that made it feel a bit better for him
that is amazing ! a parent will always love their children regardless of past decisions . how did you find her ?
that is truly amazing ! i wish you the best of luck ! and i am sure she loves you still !
no . i have kids , but they are todd ##lers .
i imagine . i left my parents and my country when i was 25 years old .
i bet that makes you angry , mine use to do the same thing and it made me furious .
h ##jo ##w do you put up with it , i know i could not do it .
what ! ? what ' s going on ?
that is very unfortunate , i hope things turn around for you my friend !
why ? did he do something terrible ?
wow , he is super rude ! beat him up !
dan ##g ! do you look like your parents ?
yu ##p , time goes by too fast !
financial stress can be a major burden . how did you get over this issue ?
that is a smart and well thought out plan
would you be able to forgive her for such a large mistake ?
that is true . and the mistake would not happen again so you do not have to worry about that
i can understand that . it took me many years before i learned to have complete faith in my wife .
the only thing i can tell you is to have faith in her judgement . if you ever lose it , it is time to cut your losses and run because it will only lead to hurt and ruin .
love her while you can and enjoy your life together . children grow up fast , i have two , a six year old girl and a nine year old boy . they are handful ##s
does your boss call on you a lot ?
you should keep your head down , not make eye contact , and make a mean face ! he won ' t call on you then !
that ' s really kind of you . what good customer service !
you deserve a raise for that mental ##ity
wow that is impressive ! how long did you train for it ?
oh no ! did you get hurt ?
that is scary ! i am glad you played it safe and decided to stop ! there is always another marathon to run !
absolutely ! and i am sure next time you will be able to finish
wow ! did you punish him or anything ?
well i hope he learns his lesson !
why , that ' s not good
what do you plan to do
result for what
yeah you clearly are well read . what does he study ?
nope , it is too scary for me !
nice , i hope i can overcome my fear one day too !
ah i was never much of a sports guy , but i do work out a lot . do you still play ?
and now they ' re rattled around by 250 ##lb guys smashing into you
ha ##ha yeah . i ' m worried about hurting myself by working out too hard
ha ##ha i wish it was that simple
what is that ?
cong ##rat ##s ! ! ! ! it is an amazing experience ! i just had a little baby girl 3 weeks ago
take it one day at a time man . it is a truly amazing thing . you will love that baby with all your heart
i understand . just be supportive as your girlfriend is probably thinking the same thing . just remember you are now both in this together so enjoy the experience .
wow what kind of exams are you taking ?
sounds hard ! i hope you do well in your exams !
that ' s very trusting . did they come back with the milk ?
good for them . nice to know that there are good people left in the world
i bet !
sometimes it can get tricky when family and money are involved . did he pay you back ?
oh man ! i hope it all works out for you .
what ' d he do ?
well maybe you should find another job
who did he bit
what can you do to help him stop drinking
wow cong ##rat ##s ! is it a boy or a girl ?
dan ##g , well i hope she has a wonderful future !
i hope there was a good reason for that !
maybe you should talk face to face with him next time you see him .
i talked with my boss recently because i thought he was angry at me but it turned out he was just having problems at home .
i am sure everything will work out just fine !
why ? what is in that room ?
the same habit that i took up
really ? have you watched any zombie movies or shows lately ?
well that might explain it , those zombies aren ' t very nice !
cute ! ! ! what did you name it ?
what kind of dog is she ?
i find them creepy too . i am actually very scared of them .
oh no that ##s pretty gross ! i hope that is not true , because if it is that is gross .
have you voiced your opinion to him yet ?
parents always think they know best . until their children prove them wrong they tend to think that .
what kind of e
as you ' re hopeful , you will get it
i ' m sorry to hear that . are you angry at him ?
well you better make sure of that . tell him if he forget ##s again you ' ll divorce him
you ' re very lucky to have such family ! when are you getting married ?
well , that ' s insane ! i ' m glad you find you life partner , and i hope everything goes the way you guys planned !
wow that is a long time ! how did you do ?
exactly ! that is a great outlook to have . you did your best and as long as you are happy personally all the rest does not matter
oh no ! have you ever had one before ?
yeah , but sometimes these things can ' t be avoided .
you are so lucky , i have been long for such a break for so long .
you get relaxed and even get more productive when you get back to work .
that is amazing ! it is nice to hear that things are going so well for you and your family !
that is wonderful ! i wish you and your family the best ! sending positive energy , love , and light your way .
is it just temporary ?
sometimes things are a necessary evil . and who knows as long as you keep your options open the perfect job may be right around the corner .
oh dear , that must ' ve been embarrassing , are you okay though ?
i hope that you didn ' t get hurt
girl , you are so lucky . you got a good one . better things are on the way for you .
on my 30th birthday , my wife bought me my dream car . a jeep . i never saw it coming .
it ' s nice to have someone who can help you always , i ' m pretty sure she loves having you by her side always
she probably appreciate you so much for doing that .
that ' s too bad . i can ' t have dogs in my apartment either . why won ' t they let you have one ?
our second family dog died last year . she was the run ##t of the litter , so it was a surprise since she was a small dog .
ah , that ' s so exciting ! is he looking forward to it ?
that ' s so cool , i ' m sure he ' ll love it and make some great friends !
do they have any sentimental value for you ?
well then maybe it is time to get rid of them ?
wow , did you fall on your butt that hard ?
that is unfortunate , but funny at the same time !
why are you scared of leaving your current job ? if you have been offered a better job then just leave you know ?
maybe you should ask i think that ' s the easiest way of discovering what is better for you !
what made it he ##ctic ?
oh , i understand . was it a long interview ?
what happened ?
uh ##nn ##n , most of us did !
what about the cats though ?
you monster ! everyone loves animals
what have you eaten ?
you are living life .
what happened ?
dan ##g , that is very unfortunate .
at least you have a wife . probably would if it weren ' t for fights over dumb things .
i hope you are right .
did you feel scared ?
was the drive a necessary one to take ?
uh ##m ##nn ##n , you really did ?
did you have a sum inside ?
it ' s always good to have a boss you can get along with . it makes work a lot less stress ##ful .
yes a boss who is helpful and has a good attitude will have earned my loyalty from the beginning . the better i feel about work the better i perform in the long run .
tell me more , i would love to know !
perfect state of mind . i will take that any day .
your friend is probably one of the luck ##iest people on earth . how do you feel about it /
well , you know everything happens for a reason .
of course i would
what made you do that ?
oh i hate group work for that exact reason . i ' d rather just have company while i did the work
what a shame . i wouldn ' t make them my partner again . ( and i might venture so far as to not ##ify the professor )
i am so sorry to hear about your dog . what happened to him ?
at least he lived a long , happy life .
i ' m pretty sure they were more than happy to help you because they are your parents in the end .
see ? they can ' t get mad at you so you sho ##ud ##n ' t feel ashamed , instead search for another job and help them .
you are so h ##ype ##d for the day . i wish that will be the same for me .
it pays to always be kind . even if you don ' t get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone .
mind telling me what happened maybe i could help you ?
you don ' t deserve a best friend like that . or even a relationship where you have to keep fighting for the attention . i suggest you leave both of them and look for your future with other people !
that ' s great . i never did a long distance one . but my brother did , and it was about 400 miles .
she was a keeper though , i ' m sure it was worth it for him .
good for you . where have you been ?
what ' d you do there ?
oh i see . do you have kids together
that ' s a good idea !
hopefully !
great , what happen ##d ?
cool , i never played the drums . my band teacher in middle school tried to discourage playing the drums cause there are no notes !
sounds like a good adventure ! where are you going to climb ?
well hopefully you won ' t die . be careful and make sure you have fun !
i hope it turned out great . did you find a good hair ##dre ##sser to do your hair ?
oh , i ' m so sorry that happened to you . i really hope you were able to get the color fixed eventually .
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that , how long have they been gone .
oh wow . . . . i hope you can get through it .
that must have been embarrassing . did the girls get in trouble for it ?
i would have switched schools if i were you . i would hate to have to be with bull ##ies like that
did she punish you ?
i hope she didn ' t make you feel too bad about it ! people make mistakes when they ' re young .
that ' s terrible . hopefully things right themselves for you soon .
the plus side about schools is that someone else will do something that everyone will focus on soon enough .
was the guitar okay ?
i stepped on my uncle ' s fishing pole , kinda hard to tell if it catches fish worse or not .
holy cow ! why did she go to jail ?
i ' m glad y ' all were able to make it through such a hard time .
wo ##ah , i never had that happen to me .
yes , we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you can ' t know their full story !
i am sure that was difficult . how is he now ?
i am so sorry for your loss . it can be a relief to know he isn ' t in pain . i felt the same way when i lost my aunt last year . she was like a mom to me .
how did the school feel about it ? don ' t they have strict rules about that ?
that ' s funny and unfortunate at the same time . i really hope your son was okay and not too trauma ##tis ##ed by the experience !
wow , that would have scared me , how did it go ?
that ' s good i have 2 teenage daughters and dread the idea of leaving them by themselves
that ' s a really big change , are you nervous ?
10 years of teaching experience , i ' m sure you ' ll end up having a great year ! don ' t stress too much .
if you regret what you did you should go ap ##olo ##gis ##e for you said to him !
i hope he can forgive you and help you forget about what you said .
you ' ll need to be careful around me then . i ' m the type of person who takes advantage of people
yeah but maybe we ' ll fall in love instead ?
why ? what ' s happening today ?
oh , my goodness . i really hope you ' re right and that the results come out negative .
you want cancer results to come out negative for cancer , not positive for it .
that ##s amazing . where was the concert ? and how many people were participated ?
cool ! ! even i wanted to learn guitar . . but have no time for it
did he came back to take it ?
you are a trust ##worthy person , glad he forgot it at your place not somewhere else
i think a lot of people feel the same , it ' s natural . is there anything in particular that you ' re scared of happening ?
there is a lot you can ' t control in life though . if you focus on the things you can control , then it might stop the negative feelings about things you can ' t control
i ' m sorry about that . what did he do ?
wow , well he will have to learn his lesson before he will get a job or go to college . that won ' t work there .
well i mean . . . does she really ? or do you just think she does
well you should be more worried about dying in a car accident , because that ' s 10 ##x more likely . drive safe
that ' s great , what kind of job was it ?
that ' s great , my one son spent time in a children ##s hospital and the care was fantastic could not have been happier with them
that ' s really interesting . do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers ?
i suppose as long as they ' re happy that ' s the main thing ! it probably benefits them being around other kids their age ?
i see , being alone can be fulfilling to . it all depends on the kind of person you are .
yes , we can discover our inner worlds whenever we ' re alone !
why ? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog . is she somewhere safe though ?
that ' s okay . you can always get yourself another dog .
that ' s amazing , it ' s always nice to get on with your family ! have you always got on with them ?
that ' s so nice to hear . i have always been very close with my family too , but i have friends who aren ' t and it ' s horrible
well , if you provided for your child ' s care then you shouldn ' t feel bad . i mean , this isn ' t the dark ages .
i am sorry you feel so bad about it . i sincerely believe god will forgive a truly rep ##ent ##ant heart .
that ' s so good . how old is she ?
i know how you feel . cong ##rat ##s on raising a young adult
that ' s really nice - it ' s always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around . what was the new thing your friend made you do ?
oh wow ! i like getting out of my comfort zone and doing new things , it ' s such a thrill . especially rock climbing - i had a friend who made me do it once too
do you hate when anybody tells you what to do , or just figures of authority ?
would you feel better if it was in the form of advise , instead of point blank telling you to do something ?
i think if you ' re confident in yourself , you can talk yourself into most jobs . you should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky !
i think so too ! i think people should have more confidence in themselves , but you always focus on the negative things more than the positive !
i ' m so jealous , i would eat pizza every day if i could ! what ' s your favourite pizza ?
i ' m not a fan of pine ##apple on pizza ! ! pepper ##oni is by far my favourite
i ' m sorry to hear that . what are you studying ?
it certainly will .
that ' s an amazing attitude . not many people are like that nowadays .
crazy world we live in .
oh wow , was in un ##pro ##vo ##ked ?
did you try to ap ##olo ##gis ##e before she hit you , or did you not have time ?
you must be having bitter , sweet emotion . i remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time .
but you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend .
i ' m sorry to hear that . did you apologize ?
i think if you ' re respectful and state what you did wrong and how you ' ll fix it , she will forgive you .
what happened ?
oh my god , how embarrassing was that ?
that is extremely loyal ! you must have a really happy relationship ?
it sounds like you really have had a good life so far ! it makes me feel happy hearing good news stories like this
that ' s so nice of you . hard ##work pays
oh yeah , you must be a brilliant student
that ' s so nice . who was it from ?
that was really nice of her to get it for you . she must love you very much .
oh no ! that ' s awkward . are you able to laugh about it now ?
ha , that ' s good ! i ' ve had so many embarrassing things happen . we all have !
oh , maybe that ' s a sign to bring fun and adventure in your relationship ?
that ' s good , there is a lot of ways to make the relationship alive and interesting !
that ' s such a shame ! were you honest with your friend , and did they forgive you ?
if she is that good a friend , i ' m sure she ' ll forgive you soon enough .
sending my positive vibe ##s to you too ! fingers crossed !
oh i ' m so sorry . losing a pet is never an easy thing .
i hope you have some friends and family that you can rely on to cheer you up . i ' m sorry about your cat and i hope you know you gave it a good life !
sky ##di ##ving is insane to me , how did it go ? what reminded you of it ?
it ' s always good to have a professional help with this kind of things , glad you had fun !
that ' s incredibly sad , i ' m so sorry for your loss . how long had you had your dog ?
do you have close friends and family that can help to support you through this time ?
oh , no ! what caused so many innocent deaths ?
i think war is universal . the causes are many .
did they anything mean to you ?
oh , it was an accident , and it ' s alright . as long as you make sure that you use the right season ##ing next time . it ' s all gonna be okay .
how did you get into this situation ?
well i think she should be the one to get you out of it ! otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser . they might be able to help you consolidate your debts
well i have never heard of god helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to las vegas all your troubles will be gone
this is a lot to ask for . i recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude
wow ! some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition !
i didn ' t mean to sound so flip ##pan ##t . that is a lot of money to lose . was the item itself expensive also ?
well , i hope they can trace it for you . better late than never . i wish you good luck with that !
i ' m really glad to hear that ! that ' s one of the best feelings i think !
i very much agree ! being grateful is important , it keeps you level headed and grounded in life !
oh god , that sounds ho ##rri ##fying , are you and your family okay ?
that ' s great , glad you managed to make everything okay afterwards , that must ' ve been a lot of hard work !
oh , my goodness ! are you and your family safe though ?
that ' s a relief . you have the people who matter safe and sound , the stuff can be replaced in time .
well , she ##s your wife after all
that ##s women for you . where you fr ##uga ##l with money ?
oh amazing ! how long were you training for , and how many people did you beat ?
that ' s incredible , well done ! i injured my knee a few months back , so haven ' t been able to run since then . so frustrating
aaa ##w ##w ##w , i ' m sorry you had to go through that
it is really hard to deal with especially if you aren ' t nearby . sounds like you really miss your sweet beast !
oh i ' m sorry you are going through that . have you tried to go back to your doctor and discuss making some changes ?
i hope that you can find a solution to help with that . good luck !
that must have been so nice for both of you . had he changed for the better ?
people do change a lot when they grow up . i met an old school friend the other day , and they were awful now !
oh that ' s so sad , i ' m really sorry about that . is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house ?
that ' s such a shame . i ' m sure something similar will come up soon though
oh no , what a nightmare ! was anyone injured ?
that ' s good then , as long as no one wa ##a hurt ! was he drunk ?
that ' s cool , a good relationship is based on trust
have you always been very trusting ?
i like food . what kind ?
that is a leg ##it lunch . solid choices . a + would eat .
aw that is very kind of you . i love morning coffee !
ha ##ha ! i think a lot of people can probably relate to that . i ' m sure she appreciate ##s it !
oh no . how bad was it ?
i can see how it would make you anxious .
is it because you are surrounded by people most of the time ? i get that way sometimes too , so i can relate .
it is good that you enjoy your alone time . sometimes we just need a little " me - time " .
that sounds like so much fun ! were you scared ?
my daughter got scared of haunted house once . it was hilarious , but i sy ##mp ##athi ##se with her and you .
yu ##ck ! at least the cock ##ro ##ach isn ' t in your kitchen anymore ! my cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door .
i wouldn ' t have been able to either ! it ' s super gross !
oh i bet that is frustrating ! can you report it to someone ?
i would feel the same way . perhaps you could mention it to your co - worker nicely and they will take pity on you .
what kind of vacuum is it ? i bought a d ##yson recently and i love it !
those vacuum ##s are amazing and are one of a kind . you should get it !
that ' s so sweet liter ##ately . he seems like a nice guy
nice ! you are a lucky lady .
oh i ' m sorry that you are going through that . have you discussed changing your medication up with your doctor ?
i hope one day you can find a solution and get back to being the old you .
oh wow , it must have been quite an overwhelming experience for both of you
cong ##rat ##s because i know you will definitely overcome the pains
wow ! the struggle is real . i hope you ' re not too tired and stressed . i wish you luck for being so self ##less !
do twins run in your family or are you just lucky ? i mean that seriously , not sarcastically
that ' s awesome ! you won the kidd ##o lottery ! i wish you all the best of health and happiness ! ! !
that ' s sad i hate to hear that how long did you have him
i love boxers they are so cool looking do you plan on getting another one ?
oh wow ! congratulations on getting promoted , that is awesome ! !
i bet , that ' s usually how it goes , but so glad to hear of your promotion . i bet you ' re super happy !
you are the best wife ever ! i can ' t believe how lucky he is !
what did he get sick with ? i hope it ' s not con ##tag ##ious !
oh yeah , did you end up passing ?
i remember those day ' s and do not miss them
that ' s terrifying ! did they catch the guy ?
i ' m so sorry . how are you coping ?
you must have been in so much pain . how did you manage to endure it ?
it great you were confident despite your illness . it ' s a sign of good character .
that is awesome and sounds like so much fun ! what are you most excited for ?
i can relate ! i love to tan and haven ' t had the chance to yet either !
i really want to try yoga ! would you say your back feels better ? this sounds so fun !
i ' m jealous ! i wish i could try it out for myself . how long have you been doing it now ?
oh that ' s awesome what kind of puppy did you get ?
that ' s too cool i would love to get a puppy some day
that ' s awesome rain is good
oh no . so what do you do in such instance ?
oh my goodness that ##s terrible . how did you find out ?
i believe that ' s for the best . you should get regularly tested after this . i hope the best for you .
om ##g , sounds creepy
i am glad you escaped it
oh no , the dread ##ed fly being down for the big meeting . how ' d it go ?
uh oh . i hope whoever saw it had a little chuckle then let it go . it ' s no big deal .
that ' s truly heartbreak ##ing . were you able to help them ?
your heart was in the right place . it sad that children can ' t be fed in our world today . maybe one day nobody will have to be hungry .
so what happened then
ok , now i understand . maybe she later got a ride home
wow ! how old is your child ? that ' s very impressive !
wow ! i can ' t even do that now ! i bet you are very proud of her .
that ' s unfortunate . maybe you can have a chat with them about it ?
that must be so in ##fur ##iating . i ' d get upset if it were me .
congratulations ! how much did you win ?
hey that ' s awesome . and you ' re right it doesn ' t , so live it up my friend !
this happened to me ! don ' t feel bad , it happens to people such as us !
she ' ll forgive you eventually . you ' ll never make the same mistake again i promise you that !
has he given you any hints that he might be planning a party ? that would be so much fun to be with all your family and friends in one place to celebrate you ! !
that is a lot of people ! ! you are loved and appreciated ! now , its time to start planning his su ##pr ##ise birthday
husbands can be so thoughtful . . . you have a good one . .
oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . that is awful and makes me sad . have you talked to anyone about it ?
that ' s what you need to focus on is just giving her all of your love , she will cher ##ish it . i ' m so sorry you ' re going through this , i hope that you can find peace with the situation .
i am glad , i hope you have a great day today !
wow , that ' s so cool of you . you really trust her
i really admire your love life .
are you ok ? that ' s absolutely devastating . i hope you have people to con ##fide in right now .
i hope things get better for you , you seem to be a good soul . i pray for your lose .
i ' m sorry to hear that . while diet is most of it , exercise can play a role too . how active is your lifestyle ?
i know it might seem like empty words from a stranger but just keep at it . try as hard as you can to stay positive you will see results , trust me .
can ' t you place a call to them ?
i just think you should just be optimistic and patient
that ' s amazing ! congratulations . what was the policy that changed ?
well that ' s great for you . everybody loves a little extra money !
i ' m sorry that ' s rough . did you ever find out why ?
i guess not , but i hope you still had ( or will have if it hasn ' t happened yet ) a great wedding !
that is really scary . did he ever catch up with you ?
thank goodness . do you know who he was ?
how close did you lose by ? i bet at the next competition , you ' ll wipe the floor with them .
understand ##able , when you put so much work into something only to be eclipse ##d by someone else . not a good feeling .
oh my goodness that is so sad , i am sorry to hear about your father . are you handling him being gone okay ?
i understand completely . i hope that you can enjoy going to more games , and carry on his spirit when you go .
always !
oh no ! that is really embarrassing . hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day .
at least it wasn ' t something you did on purpose . i ' m sure it will blow over !
i think it ' s so weird that cats do that . it ' s like they are bringing us trophies or something !
yeah i would be a little horrified too if my cat did that ! i ' m dying of laughter thinking about your situation .
that ' s so sweet . it ' s good to have that kind of faith in your relationships .
congratulations . i hope you stay happy always .
have you called any rescue center yet ?
lets hope it will trace the house back
oh wow , good for you . that education will help you the rest of your life !
it can be frightening , especially with all those new classmates and teachers .
oh man , i would have been really frustrated . does she know he is dating you now ?
it ' s never fun to see your significant other around someone they used to date . at least he is with you now and i ' m sure you have nothing to worry about !
i totally understand the anxiety . you never know if they are bait ##ing you or actually giving you a good deal . did you get a new car ?
i ' m so happy you were able to get a depend ##able vehicle . i always have someone come with me as well . it ' s nice to have a second pair of eyes .
i ' m so sorry to hear about that , it must be awful . do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this ?
when my relatives have died , it helps me to remember the good times , and makes me smile instead of being sad
aw , he sounded like such a great friend !
i am so sorry , that is so tragic . at least you have some good memories with him .
that is so sweet . i really com ##men ##d people who treat kids like their own , it ' s so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner . i have a step ##da ##ught ##er myself .
yes , it ' s true in life too when you grow up , sometimes the best family has nothing to do with blood relations .
oh no now that ' s a sticky situation ! how ' d you manage ?
yeah hopefully all the hoop ##la over the first day distracted everyone . i am sorry that happened to you though .
oh man , i am sorry ! i have been there , it sucks ! are you okay though ?
i am glad you are okay . i wrecked my favorite car 3 years ago and i still miss it .
oh really ? what was it for ?
oh wow , i can only imagine . paperwork is not fun . i hope you got it all done eventually !
that ##s awe ##ful !
uh ##m ##nn ##n !
that is great , that is the beginning of happiness
wow , that is true love
wow , that ' s lovely . so you will start keep fit
it will help you , even in blood circulation
oh no ! how did they react ?
what did you do ? i would just laugh it off .
that ' s a shame , i ' m sorry . does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work ?
i believe that , a lot of people think because you ' re at home that you have time for things other than work .
i am sorry to hear about your dog passing away . but , i ' m happy you have a new friend in the new one .
it ' s good you were able to find new companions ##hip in your new dog . congratulations on your new pet .
i hear you ! is she going out with her girlfriends ?
ah ##h , sounds like a tough situation . maybe you should try letting your girlfriend know how you feel .
she is a grown women so you can ##t tie her up or she will choke . i hope everything works out for you .
how mort ##ifying ! did anyone hear it ? did it smell ?
yi ##kes ! i can ' t even imagine how embarrassing that was .
happy riding to your daughter
please do asa ##p !
that ' s awesome , i hope he returns the favor as well .
that ' s amazing . love is absolutely grand . i am happy for you two .
oh yeah , i ' ve been there , i really understand
you will really have enough time to rest
that sounds wonderful ! do you get to use them yet ?
i haven ' t had a chance to try bath bombs yet . but my daughter in - law loves them .
oh no ! kids do that sometimes . what happened ?
it ' s hard when they grow up . hopefully she will learn from her mistakes .
oh no ! i would be angry too !
yes , they do . it ' s a season of learning .
oh that sounds good ! i ' m sure you studied lots ?
that is excellent news . you must be very proud .
hey that ' s not too bad how long are you going for ?
lo ##l hey a week is a reasonable time to pack three backs , i would do the same
wow , how did that almost happen ? i would re ##thi ##nk my options .
good keep temptation ##s at a distance . you never want to mess up a good relationship over a one night st ##nad .
did they do a good job of cleaning your house ?
that would make me nervous , you never know if they are looking through your things .
that helps a lot with the peace of mind . i am glad it worked out well for you !
it is nice when they can build up that trust with you !
that ' s a shame . do you know who stole it ?
did they take anything else ?
oh no . that happened to my sister last year . we were able to work out a plan , but she had to get a loan temporarily .
that ' s no fun , but i hope everything works out for next semester .
ok , how much raise did you get ?
how much please ?
too bad you ' ve been let down so often . i ' m glad your new worker is satisfactory .
it ' s good to have someone so trust ##worthy . congratulations .
do you still live nearby ?
it ' s good that you have pleasant memories . what was your favorite thing about the neighborhood ?
did you like it ? what did you buy ?
that ' s too bad . i hope they didn ' t charge you for the items they missed .
i ' m so sorry , you must feel terrible . it ' s their loss in the long run .
i can imagine you ' re very angry . you ' ll find someone better .
oh man that ' s not good at all ! did he break anything ?
oh that ' s really nice of you i am glad he ' s okay
it ' s awesome to have a partner like that . that ' s certainly why they call it " the other half . "
i second that . finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joy ##s a human being can experience .
well i toast you to 10 more and beyond .
how did it turn out ?
oh no ! how awful ! did your thanksgiving improve ?
i would be mort ##ified !
cool ! where did you move too ?
oh , that does not seem like such hard work . it is fun to move into new houses . i like moving around .
oh good ! so glad it is all working out . i will come by and say hi one day . catch you later !
i understand , life can do that to you , and looking back always bring fond memories
just think , today will be tomorrow ' s memories when looking back
oh ! did you find any good deals ?
uh oh . . . was it tainted ? i wouldn ' t risk it . . .
flag football is so much fun ! what position would you like to play ?
you could certainly bring some physical ##ity to the position with your height . i say go for it !
that ' s really good . . . i am very sorry for your loss . it sounds cl ##iche but it gets better with time
you ' re gonna be okay . it ' s been five years since i ' ve lost mine . just keep her close to your heart .
that was so nice of them , what kind of pets ?
quite the little zoo . what a great friend you have !
i ' m so sorry for your loss !
oh , sorry to hear that . there is something going around these days . i hope they are better now .
that sounds so sweet . family time is the best !
i know me too ! why are you ready ?
yeah it does ! great job man i ' m proud of you !
you are prepared more than ever !
that ' s the spirit ! always believe in yourself !
i have not , i feel like it should be done by a professional .
oh no ! probably tons of years of dirt cake ##d into the rug . did you use the right cleaner ?
maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them .
i hope you can find a solution that works for you !
that must ' ve been fun ! what did you guys do ?
oh that sounds like so much fun ! sounds like you are very grateful for good friends !
that sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car !
on no ! i ' m sorry you were embarrassed , but i ' m sure it sounded wonderful !
what game do you play ?
oh ##hh ##h . what kind of game is it ?
wow , is it the first time you ' re gonna see him ? is he going to stay at your place ?
sounds like you planned for everything ! enjoy yourself !
that ##s awesome , never settle for less . always strive for more !
well hopefully you can still maintain communication with them . it ' s normal to be nervous though , just go in confident
that ' s the best way to do it . read before you buy .
it ' s amazing how dirty they can get , isn ' t it .
yes , my internet provider is notorious for that
oh wow , did they justify the over ##cha ##rge ? i ' d dispute it
that must have been a good thing did y ' all celebrate .
hard work should pay off nice to hear about some one getting back after they put in congratulations .
yeah , my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test
i don ' t blame you ! he should have been more responsible .
what ?
om ##g , what happened ?
pe ##sky snakes . was it a black racer ? i see those all the time in my yard .
i would too ! lo ##l .
that ' s awesome ! is something holding you back ?
buying a home can be nerve wr ##ack ##ing but in the end it ' s worth it !
wishing you luck and here ' s to finding the perfect home !
sometimes i ' m worried that i ' m that family member , but i ' m not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me .
i ' m happy that your brother is in sob ##riety now . i hope his life recover ##s .
i am sorry that happened . i have 3 dogs myself .
good dogs are hard to v ##fin ##d i can imagine how sad that must have been .
i enjoy reading .
it ' s cool that you ' re such a fan though . i hope the movie lived up to your expectations .
oh , yes i remember those days too so clearly . such care ##free day , right ?
yeah , it was like the only thing to do in summer . the whole town comes out and the pool is crowded ! oh , those were the days !
what did you see ?
a what on the handle ?
me too . about friends an d family . things i got to see and do .
yes . some more than others . but sometimes i think it ' s all relative .
oh no ! how did that end ?
that ' s not good . i ' m sorry that happened to you .
oh that is so selfish . did you try and get back at her ?
that ##s great , says a lot about the type of person you are , in a good way ! i probably would ' ve gone for revenge knowing myself .
is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason ?
that ' s great that you have that type of relationship with him . my husband and i approach things together and discuss everything , which works great for us . you have to do what works for you and your relationship .
that ' s always a good thing .
that will be really convenient . there ' s one near us we like to skate ##board to .
oh no ! i hate that ! so what did you do about it ?
wow , no power at home is terrible . what would we do without electricity ? !
poor dog ! did you find out why ? is it better now ?
aw ##w , that ' s cute ! i love older dogs , but i know it can be scary sometimes when they show signs of poor health . i ' m glad he was okay !
oh ! what was it about ?
i hate clown ##s ! when i try to run i sink into the ground .
oh no ! i hate spiders ! were you able to avoid them and move your pots ?
if people knew it was because of spiders they ' d totally understand . i can ' t stand their creepy crawl ##y bodies !
i have a friend like that . we lose touch but we will always be great friends .
that ' s awesome . now i miss my friend . lo ##l
do you guys live far away from each other ? i love talking with my mom about her and my childhood .
aw that ' s awesome . i bet he enjoyed getting to know your past a little bit better .
oh no . did he stand you up ?
that stink ##s ! were you able to get the stain out ?
was the date at least good ?
that sounds like good news and bad . i hope you will be going with him someday . : )
sometimes our best life experiences are after we make big changes in our life . it sounds like a fun adventure to me . : )
rain is relaxing to myself , odd
that ' s annoying ! the weather team has one job . rain is so relaxing to be used for shower ##ing .
that ' s a wonderful situation to be in . are you planning to tell her ?
that ' s understand ##able , but you won ' t know her position on the issue until you bring it up . either way it ' s your call .
oh really what movie ?
i am so sorry . were you disappointed ?
i love road trips , sounds like a good time .
hope you have a nice trip , it ' s good to have things to look forward to .
that sounds relaxing ! what did you watch
maybe i ' ll do that tonight !
me too !
oh no ! i ' m so sorry . what kind of dog was he ?
aw ##w . mine is getting pretty old . i ' m not looking forward to losing him .
you think you will get another one ?
oh boy , i guess you ' ll have your hands full .
i could understand that . i don ' t like crowds so lo ##l .
that ##s good . abusive relationships are the worst .
great ! you deserve it !
yu ##ck . did you throw the remote out ?
they have a mind of their own some days .
did you get all of it done ?
that ' s why i wear long shirts . you can work . and not off ##end anyone !
mistakes are made , but still . i can how that would be annoying .
i understand completely . i would have done the same .
wow , that must have been pretty challenging . where you able to do it ?
oh man , that ' s brutal . so close , but so far .
that sounds awesome ! did everything go well ?
that ' s not too bad , i ' m glad you had a good va ##ca ##y and your friend is trust ##worthy !
did you adopt an animal
i feel all for those poor animals and want to adopt all of them
it would definitely be hard . i feel bad for them being in cages .
i am sorry to hear that , i know she will be better
before you know it , she will be out and about
i bet it was , i ' m glad you are doing better now . did they find the person driving the van ? did they even stop ?
wow , that ##s awesome you were only in for a few days . i guess i haven ' t had an accident that bad before but i would have thought it would have been a longer time period .
that ##s awesome , i am really glad your ##e ok now : )
oh no ! ! ha ##ha . the first days of school can be so he ##ctic ! but soon the routine will set in again and all will be good . : )
oh i can imagine ! glad everyone is ok !
i would of did the same .
did you kill it ?
it was a very devastating storm .
i hope so , no one should have to live through ##t hat
how exciting ! you must be so proud of him . what an accomplishment !
you definitely should be ! hopefully you took lots of photos !
ha ##ha ##ha , that is hilarious ! we have some mega spiders where i live . imagine pulling some toilet paper and a huge spider the size of your hand comes jumping out . it happened to me ! !
yeah , they can help get the spider outside .
oh wow that is cool , i don ' t think ill ever purchase a new car . a good used one will be my best option !
i have and infinity ! ! ! its an older 2006 model i got it at a insane ##ly good price around 4 ##k
i watched that happen . been thinking about doing some research on trading with bit ##co ##in .
that ' s a good idea . i think there is al ##ot of promise there . good luck .
yi ##kes ! i ' d have jumped too .
we don ' t have any roach ##es where i live luckily .
that sounds awesome . it ' s important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked .
i may have to encourage some of my family to pick up martial arts . we never del ##ved to the high levels and i see a lot p ##f value in the teachings .
that sounds great you must be jazz ##ed up about it
you ' ll be great , i wish i was there to see it
oh , that is terrible ! did you try to save the cat ?
ah ##hh , what a horrible thing to see in the morning ! hope your day went well after that .
i ' ve never heard of a hot water beach . what ' s it caused by ?
was that the cool ##est thing that you did there ?
who are we talking about ? i ' m sorry you ' re upset . maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help .
it ' s okay . we all need to vent sometimes . bosses are the worst people to deal with sometimes .
i bet it was ! did you end up finding it or did you have to cancel all of your cards ?
that ##s awesome ! i know stores will typically hold onto a lost wallet but calling you is going above and beyond what the norm is .
i must have been terrifying , i am glad you both made it through it
its nice to have another to lean on when it happened
that is awful ! i can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good .
i really hope they listen and can make some changes !
that must ' ve been nice . i bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid . did you enjoy your time with your mom ?
ha ! that ' s awesome . the 80 ' s style was so cool !
that ' s really rough . do you think he may have re ##la ##pse ##d ?
i would be too . going through something like that can take a toll on anyone , and makes it hard to cope with everyday life . i hope he gets the help he needs .
that ##s aw ##some hopefully he sticks with it . its a chick mag ##bn ##et
that ' s a great thing to have going for him !
ha ##ha , yeah cats can be rude ! i prefer dogs myself . they are much sweet ##er .
oh man ! i feel for you !
was it a ko ##ala ?
i bet that was pretty awesome . how ' d you grow your eucalyptus ?
she sounds like a keeper
well i wish the best for both of you
that ' s awesome ! did she have a good time doing the play ?
i now the feeling , i always had stage fright as a kid . hopefully it wasn ' t too tough for her .
aw , you must be lonely . at least you have her pet with you , right ? what pet does she have ?
yeah , cats are a little tricky . i think dogs are much more friendly , but that ' s just me !
oh man , that is terrifying . i ' m glad you didn ' t get hit . what kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time ?
i know that feeling , i see that kind of stuff all the time where i live too . i hope you stay safe .
yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors .
i definitely understand . my doctor is not super close either .
yeah , did something in particular make you feel that way ?
wow , that ' s awesome ! good for you guys , i hope you have many more happy years together . : )
aw ##w , i ' m sorry . that ' s a tough one to go through . mine had the same .
how old is she ? i remember mine couldn ' t remember me me but i could still make her laugh ,
you will regret not going i think you should go
see you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went
wow , that ##s cool . what did you do ?
oh ! that ' s something to look forward to then ! decide what your gonna do ?
cool ! that ' s what i always do on my birthday too ! lo ##l
cool ! are you going ?
keep mt ##ur ##king brother
nice ! is that a per ##k of your job or did you have to use a vacation day ?
that ##s so awesome , is it coming up or is that something they offered when you took the job ?
what ' s the movie ? i love watching new stuff .
i ' d love to see that . i was a big fan of winnie the po ##oh growing up , so i bet i ' ll love it .
aw dan ##g , that must really be pain for you . have you talked with anyone else about this ? i ' m sure other people are having problems with this cow ##or ##ker also .
oh ##hh ##hh ##hh , yeah that ' s really hard on everyone then . taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers , if you need to vent out any more frustration ##s , just let me know !
oh yes ! i really hate that . it has happened to me more than i like . did you get a ref ##und at least ?
did you get a ref ##und at least ?
oh no , that is so sad . i am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there .
i understand , funeral ##s can be heartbreak ##ing . but it gives you good closure !
congratulations ! that is always a great feeling ! a reward after such hard work . : )
this is very true and what all the great thinkers out there preach !
it can ' t hurt to try , might as well give it a shot , right ?
the worse they can do is not hire you , gotta put yourself out there . best of luck !
do you run into this issue a lot ? i could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare
does online shopping make it easier ? i would think maybe it would relieve some stress if you could do it from your house
i do ! it gross ##es me out , even when it ' s my own .
i completely understand . hopefully the manager was able to take care of it for you !
oh no ! so i guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home ?
well , i ' m glad you didn ' t hurt yourself at least .
that ' s just disgusting !
i ' m glad you were there to show that people still care .
it happens to everyone , being tired makes people so ir ##rita ##ble . being a mom is tough as it is .
just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him , and i ' m sure all will be forgiven ! : )
i bet you ' ve had to do a lot of prep work . do you feel ready ?
what day do you leave for the trip ?
that ' s very inspiring . how has it changed your life ?
yes , i think everything in life happens for a reason and we can ' t change that . i ' m glad you had your breakthrough !
what made you want to be a nurse ?
that ' s good , it ' s a lot of work , sure you are ready for that ?
oh wow . did you not want to go ?
lo ##l . aw ##w . i hope he is back now . mine no longer lives with me and i kind of like the quiet .
did you have to get it pulled ?
do you feel better now that you got it done ?
that ' s awesome , i haven ' t been to a concert in ages . who is the band ?
i hope you have a great time ! i should try and see a show soon so i can be cool like you .
how do you feel about that ?
aw ##w ! you must feel lonely . is he coming back soon ?
those must have brought back some great memories .
i haven ' t watched any old videos in a very long time , i ' ll have to see if i can find some next time i ' m at my parents .
i have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids ! they say it ' s like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born
that has to be a very powerful feeling .
do you think they are up to something ?
you should be careful about jumping to conclusions .
that ' s nice , pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems !
you should have a beer with him or something to show your gratitude !
uh oh . is he better now ?
ok , good . what do you think caused the infection in the first place ?
is he a baby ? i heard it happens often .
aw , that ' s so sweet ! do you see a future together ?
i really , really hope it works out for you guys !
that had to be rough , and glad to hear you ' re better . do you have any follow - up appointments to go to ?
well , at least you have some relief for now . i hope that it stays in re ##mission .
hey , good for you ! that takes dedication . i admire that .
losing a few pounds has such a positive effect . you must feel better too . i need to get on that !
that ' s really exciting for her ! but i ' m sure being apart will be difficult for both of you .
hopefully she isn ' t too far away for you to visit often !
man , that really stink ##s . did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboard ##s ?
when will your house be put back together ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . death is not an easy thing to cope with .
it ' s a difficult way to realize you should live every day to the full ##est potential .
how exciting ! first time there ?
what ##s it like ? i have never been there .
sailor moon ~ ! that was the best show ! i ' ve shared it with my kids , too . and the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as sailor jupiter from lo ##oo ##oo ##ong ago !
my girls think i ' m the cool ##est because i watch sailor moon and dragon ##ball super and a ton of other anime and i ' m like , " i ' ve been watching stuff like this since before you were born ! "
that ' s good ! i ' ve got the ones that like watching anything about space . the older one wants to be on a mars mission !
oh , man . did you end up falling ?
ou ##ch . did you get bruised up ?
i ' m sorry to hear that she passed away . had she been sick a long time ?
wow . i hope she wasn ' t in any pain .
i think most people have been there . its tough disappointing your parents and even worse when you know you could have done something about it .
i got some bad grades in college and told my parents i was doing better than i was . i know how ashamed i felt at that time too .
how much money are we talking ?
fair enough . $ 100 can be made easily ; a watch with sentimental value is price ##less .
hopefully , your hard work pay ##ed off . where the finals hard ?
i agree with you . hard work tends to give the results in the end .
oh , lucky ! that is one of my favourite places on earth !
did you enjoy it once you got there ?
it really is . i ' ve been to both disney world and ds ##ine ##y land , i think i prefer disney land .
i know but it feels more . . . . authentic or something !
that ' s really bad , what are you going to do ?
well at least you have a safety net .
that ' s got to be exciting ! [ and as a parent , i salute you ! ] what grade do you teach ?
oh , wow ! that does sound fun ! just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while !
what sorts of things do the kids learn how to make ?
i wish they had that when i was in school in 199 * cough ##co ##ugh * : )
that should be fun ! do you go every year ?
very cool ! that ' s awesome you have that opportunity to do something you love every summer !
yeah , lawn mo ##wing sucks ! do you have a large lot ?
maybe that riding mo ##wer would be a worthy investment ?
that sounds miserable .
why didn ' t you ask her to begin with ?
that ' s good ! was there a reason for the suspension ?
it ' ll be good for her to have your support , so hopefully she ' ll do better this semester .
oh my god what happened ?
did it get on him ?
wow , i ' m sorry about getting fired , but it sounds like you ' ve got guts ! how do you like the business ?
oh that is so great . so many people fan ##tas ##ize about doing that . congratulations !
oh cool ! have they arrived yet ?
yeah it
i love scary movies ! what was it about ?
i love her ! i ' m definitely going to see it , thanks for the rec !
yeah i hate when people do that . it can ruin things .
friends come and go in life , it ' s up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with this person or not .
oh my . you are brave . thank goodness they didn ' t break . did you mom know what happened ?
that ' s good . my mom would freak
sounds amazing ! what kind of art does she want to produce ?
wow . sculpture . very impressed .
is it that time where you live ? how do you prepare ?
wow . that must make you nervous . where do you live ?
what is the secret ?
that ' s something she should know .
that ##s awesome , were they for school or for fun ?
that ##s awesome ! they ##ll come in handy on those rainy days or nice relaxing days !
your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy
you will enjoy it as he grows older because you had a hand in it and know that he will be prepared for it
om ##g that sounds awful ! was your friend upset ?
nah , if they were understanding it ' s all good ! everyone has a little too much from time to time .
he must have saved up quite a bit for that . they ' re pretty expensive
being fr ##uga ##l is always a benefit in the long run . i suggest doing online surveys to make some extra cash ; )
that ' s great ! how many dogs do you have ?
aw ##w ##w ##w ! that sounds so fun ! and they sound like such happy little guys !
nope - school started for the kids today !
this is the earliest they ' ve ever started here .
oh that sounds amazing ! were you a little jealous ? did they have fun ?
i completely understand . it does sound amazing though !
i know what you mean . we are only lucky enough to travel local .
oh no ! i am so sorry . that is really tough .
did you get any feedback on what you could do to improve your chances next time ?
ah , that happens . again , very sorry . maybe you can find the silver lining in it . or , find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else .
wow ! that ' s a good deal - i wish i knew how to find that !
aw ##w , that ' s disappointing . sorry to hear that .
aw i am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing . it ' s hard to lose a pet . we just lost our cat this year .
it will get easier . hang in there !
it does . i just got a new kitten a few weeks ago . it helps to have her to cu ##ddle with .
congratulations . is it for something that you ' re keen on pursuing a little longer term ?
oh i ' m sorry to hear that . still , onwards and upwards . i wish you all the best !
that sounds sweet .
why didn ' t you ?
they usually use their smartphone ##s while driving , which is very bad for every ##ob ##ys safety
yes , we as a community must teach people how to drive properly without any risks
congratulations ! that ' s awesome . sometimes it ' s scary to risk rejection , but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case .
i ' m about to switch careers , so i ' ll be doing the interviewing thing soon . it ' s scary .
why do you feel that way ?
you sound a bit like me . i get lost in the details of things myself sometimes . i ' m sure after you weigh the pro ##s and con ##s of the situation you ' ll come to the right conclusion for yourself .
aw , really ? was it a long time ago , or did you graduate recently ?
i graduated a long time ago too - - 1985 . those were great times for me too . i feel sentimental about it .
that ' s so great ! i hope you get the job - assuming it ' s one you really want .
then keep your head up & keep reaching for the stars ! maybe this will be the one ! ! but even if it doesn ' t turn out , keep on searching . your perfect job is waiting for you . : )
you ' re welcome & best wishes with your job hunting !
mine went back to school today ! i watched the bus drive off and i kinda looked around and said to myself , " well shoot , what now ? "
mine are older and think they ' re too cool for everything . i took my usual ' first day of school ' picture and i got , " mom , aren ' t we too old for this ? "
when they ' re little , that ' s the best age for pictures - they ' ll never meet a camera that they don ' t like .
the same ! 17 , 15 , [ girls ] and 10 [ boy ]
that ' s so fun ! i ' ve always wanted to get into baking . how did the cake turn out ?
i bet you were so proud of your creation ! i hope everyone enjoyed the cake .
i ' m sorry . i bet you miss her a lot ?
that must be really tough . i hope you can see her again soon .
wow ! where did you find those ? i remember watching that series as a kid !
it ' s so good to see old shows we grew up on coming out on dvd !
you must ' ve been really disappointed in him . did you talk to him and find out why he did it ?
he better be ! sounds like he ' s in the wrong crowd . hopefully , he finds new friends soon .
you ' re lucky to have her ! it ' s hard to find someone to trust .
aw , i ' m sure you tell her . i hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults .
aw ##w , i ' m sure that ' s been nothing but positive for you .
mom ##s . they are the best .
sounds like a great friend to have . do you guys still keep in touch ?
it happens to everyone honestly , i can relate . we will always have good memories to remember though , and that ##s what matters the most .
sounds fun ! how close are you to your target ?
that should help with the cost then . how much money do you need to save ?
those are the most fun sorts of essays to write - and the easiest . how do you think you did ?
wow ! sounded like a real breeze ! what did you write about ?
that is very kind of you . im sure the owner was very app ##re ##cia ##tive !
if i lost mine hiking i would for sure think it was gone forever . hopefully they didn ##t cancel too many cards before you got it back to them !
these things take time . have you met any of your neighbors ?
maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors . or look online for meet ##ups for ho ##bbies that you ' re interested in .
ah . that sucks . long com ##mute ##s are miserable ! hopefully you do better at the course this time .
ye ##a those out of state fees can be ridiculous . best of luck to you !
that ##s really nice of you . do you feed them too ?
aw ##w ##w , have you adopted any that you brought in ?
that ' s great ! how do you think it went ?
with that kind of confidence , you should be a shoe - in for the promotion !
aw that ' s wonderful ! what kind of dog ?
oh nice , they can be so sweet and gentle .
lucky you ! i wanna go there to .
it probably is , at least you get to experience another culture .
not really i kill everything
are they carrot flowers ?
really , did you tell them your secrets ?
how did it make you feel to disclose that information ?
yes , everyone does . that was really brave of you !
i see you are a ps ##4 fan
i don ##t have a ps ##4 , al ##ot of people play fort ##ni ##te . is that a cool game ?
oh yeah , many times . not a whole lot of fun .
wow . i hope you didn ' t hurt yourself !
that ' s exciting ! are you hitting up one of the amusement parks ?
i have always wanted to go to that . i love universal , and halloween is my favorite holiday
were either of the dogs hurt ?
your neighbor is very careless . thankfully no one got hurt
really , what is the secret ?
wow , that is some secret .
lo ##l , right ! she would def ##int ##ely make world star .
oh nice ! first one ?
i bet . do you have any children of your own ?
so that means extra spoil ##age : p
by spoil do you mean mountain dew ?
that ##s awesome ! i was actually looking for mine the other day . were you looking up anyone in particular or just for fun ?
i still see my high school buddies on a somewhat regular basis but it is a great time telling those stories over and over .
o ##oh , sounds nice , always good to see the siblings .
ha ##h , i hope you two have some fun . my sisters visited me a few weeks ago and we had some fun .
i didn ' t even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training , how did it fail do you know ?
wow , i bet it will be a really good dog then . hopefully you hear something soon !
uh - oh that ' s not good ! did they understand ?
yeah you got lucky there for sure !
nice ! was he surprised , or hoping to do better /
that ' s great ! which belt has he earned ?
what happened ?
oh man , that sucks [UNK]
it ' s okay , there will be other times
that must have felt very good . and taken a lot of determination .
it ' s great to have friends in the classroom . are you still friends with some of them ?
that ' s good . sometimes classmates can make all the difference , i agree .
that ' s terrible ! are you repairing it yourself ?
can they be fixed , or do you have to get different cabinets ?
no way ! that ##s awesome ! ! how old is your son ?
i bet ! that ##s great news though , cong ##rat ##s to him !
did you finally manage to find a house you like ?
i remember how frustrating house hunting was . glad it has worked out for you .
oh yeah , school year starts soon . well i hope you ' ll have an easy year !
that ' s beautiful , looks like you ' ve found a job that ' s fulfilling !
that happens , you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them .
oh well that seems improper , you should bring it up to her supervisor .
i hear that . i can ' t afford all of them , but i have several . nintendo forever !
i haven ' t got that one yet , but once i have a bit of spare cash i ' ll look into it .
oh no . you must feel app ##re ##hen ##sive . you forgive yourself ?
good . we all make mistakes . it ' s the human condition .
that ' s really nice . did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about ?
i ' m glad you have something to remind you of them !
that ' s so stress ##ful .
yes it does . the d ##m ##v has the longest wait times . you go in first thing and already have a 45 minute wait from the get go .
sometimes it can be hard to be patient , i can totally relate to that . not sleeping well can make you really ir ##rita ##ble sometimes .
i hear ya , don ' t be too hard on yourself though . being a parent can really test you ! i ' m sure you are doing fine .
are you excited to get back to work ?
i ' m sure the students are nervous about meeting their new teacher as well .
that must be very challenging to deal with at times .
i can understand being em ##aba ##rra ##ssed by that as well .
you must be excited ! are you a huge fan ?
sounds interesting . i do a bit . not an avid fan though .
well that must have been nice ! i assume you wanted it and not something different ?
no that sounds great , i don ' t go to the same places enough for that , maybe i ' ll get lucky someday !
i hate when cow ##or ##kers fight , it is so uncomfortable and you don ' t want to take sides
i do not know what to say , i guess the best thing to do is let them work it out on their own
i love to look at photos
what is your favorite memory of your birthday ?
sounds like a lot of fun .
i like to go out for dinner .
that ' s not something that should be done in a meeting . if they ' re going to argue it should be done in private .
do you know if they managed to work things out ?
oh no ! how terrible . i hope no one was hurt .
that is horrible . i can ' t even imagine .
no , im 20 years old . don ##t plan on having kids for another couple years !
what ' s tr ##ou ##bling about them ?
oh my good ##nes that must have been a lot of fun ! how long did it take ?
i bet . i used to have a dog years ago and have had that happen too .
really ? did you get up to see what made the sound ?
yeah , that noise would have scared me and i would have grabbed a weapon to .
that ' s funny .
what did you decide on ?
that is a good thing to do , im sure you feel empowered because of that
funny how that happens , isn ' t it ? any memories in particular stand out ?
that ' s great that she ' s kept so many ! i bet your family will appreciate that as time goes on .
what class do you teach ?
how interesting . i bet you are super proud .
im sorry to hear that do you have insurance to help you ?
yeah well im glad you at ##lea ##st have that to help you
that ' s awesome ! you are fortunate to have a mom like that
do you live with your mom still ?
that ##s not good , did he do something to you ?
im sorry but you should still never hit him . it could just make him bit again
im sorry to hear that . did you ask them why ?
how did you hear about what happened ?
im sorry to hear that , how old was the pet ?
yeah that is pretty old for a animal but that is life i guess
sorry to hear you had a wreck but thankful you had insurance
i think its wonderful you will not have any expenses from the wreck
that is awesome we need more people like that in the world
yeah you are a very lucky person
what do you think you can do about it ?
busted that ##s good stealing is a horrible thing to deal with .
what happened ?
im sorry that happened . did it at ##lea ##st smell good ?
o ##ops . what did you bet about ?
i like to bet in the football pools at the bar i visit . i lose a lot though .
im sorry to hear that . did you hurt yourself ?
yeah i can only im ##aga ##ine
you know , i love cats but do you think it needs a mental evaluation or was it upset you were gone so long ?
well it sounds like it was your fault then i would attack you to if you left me at home all day with food ! lo ##l
i don ##t think i would do that . seems a little odd to me
still that seems a little strange to do
congratulations i know you must be very proud
that ##s important these days more than ever .
no is it fun ?
that is really cheap !
was it your birthday ?
what did she buy ya ?
can you see it from your back ##y ##ward ?
im sorry to hear that . i don ##t like my neighbors either
oh . was it because she didn ' t trust you or you didn ' t trust her ?
well that is good . not too many people trust their spouse ##s nowadays .
that is great , how far is he away from yo ##yu
yeah that is pretty far
i love vegas what did you like the best ?
i would too . i like the light shows and magic shows
have you found anything promising ?
well keep looking something is out there for you
e ##w ##w ##w ##w
it smelled bad and you felt bad lo ##l
i do
yeah but where i live snow and ice are not really a issue
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . i hope you are feeling better .
that ' s good . and your girlfriend sounds like a real keeper .
well maybe you should move closer to them ?
yeah the cold can affect us older gen ##ts in some odd ways .
mom ##s like to do that , they worry about their kids !
you should talk to her every chance you can , you never know when it will be your last .
that sounds like soo ##o much fun ! i want to get a hot tub someday .
that is good . it ' s not good to be stressed .
im sorry , but you should still try to remain positive about it
i know , you just have to take it one day at a time
that is very odd , i wouldn ' t give them any of that information . he is up to no good !
good call ! i would of done the same thing . you can never be too careful !
man , i love when you can enjoy some good food from your childhood . it brings back so many memories .
for sure , i miss being able to have my mom ##s cooking . now i am very far away from her .
that is frustrating ! most people don ' t know basic trouble shooting skills .
yeah , it can be hard to be patient with people like that .
i would be mad too , you should demand him to buy you more !
yeah , make him regret doing such a cruel thing .
yes it has been a very wild and wet summer .
i bet . this has been the most rainy season i have ever seen
dar ##n ! why did you have to cancel ?
oh my goodness ! that is scary ! i am glad to hear you are ok .
oh no , that is so unfortunate and so un ##th ##ough ##tf ##ul of the other driver !
yeah , it shouldn ' t affect your insurance . since you were not at fault . but who knows how the whole thing will turn out .
that would be , i hope your insurance takes care of you !
that is good , it is nice to be proud of the work you have done !
now you can relax and enjoy the rest of your day .
its nice when family has your back .
that ##s always important anytime your in a dangerous si ##yu ##ation .
oh , that ' s nerve wr ##ack ##ing , the waiting , especially when you know you are good for the job .
well , this is how you get some , but having to deal with situations where your only choice is to wait patiently !
oh wow , was it scary in there ?
i can ' t stand the haunted houses where things jump out at you
that is really nice of her , i wish i had a neighbor that was that nice !
i need to actually build a relationship with my neighbors . i barely even know mine .
congratulations ! is this your first ever promotion ?
cool ! what industry do you work in ?
i bet . i hate when a few people mess up a good thing .
im sorry that happened .

i agree . i think it is important for couples to be secure enough ##t to be happy that way .
i have been reading a lot it really helps me relax so much .
congratulations . did you get a raise too ?
that ##s excellent .
ah ##h , i know that feeling . did you have a stress ##ful day ?
i ' ll keep my fingers crossed for you !
is your spouse jealous ? why did you feel you couldn ' t go ?
it ' s a party with lots of people , not a private dinner . i respect and understand your devotion to your husband though .
i am so sorry to hear about that . it is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person , especially the good memories .
oh dear , i can only imagine please stop blaming yourself . i feel your pain .
i stay home on black friday . too many people for me .
i ' m sure you will have fun .
it is such a wonderful thing to have a mom who one can depend on .

oh yes mothers make our lives much better and gives us a new meaning in life .
and also be thankful that you have a job
were you hurt ?

just remember things happen for a reason . when one door closes another one opens .
just stay positive and always be thankful .
it ' s good that you ' re confident . what subject do your exams cover ?
oh , sounds difficult . good luck .
if it is a treasure ##d gift , your friend should not be asking for it ! how did you feel when she did ask you ?
did she understand when you gave her the reason you didn ' t want to lend it to her ?
she doesn ' t sound like a good friend to me !
that can be very stress ##ful . i hope you did well .
i might try listening to some calming music . stress can have a negative impact on your health .
who is jan ##ie ?
aw ##w that ' s great , dogs can be so loving .
that must be really hard to deal with . have you tried an aluminum free de ##od ##oran ##t ? it helps me
i am sorry you have to deal with that . i am lucky because i don ' t sweat that much . can ' t imagine having to deal with that . i hope you find something that can help you
i just moved to a small town and we don ' t have a dairy queen here . i used to go to one where i lived before .
it was always clean with quick service . the workers were always very friendly also . i miss that about my hometown , people are much more quiet and keep to themselves here . are you originally from there ?
have you ever thought about moving to a different city / state ? do you think you would be happy someplace new ?
i think i would like to move eventually , but for now i ' m barely learning how to be independent , i started abu ##sing drugs at age 14 , now 15 years later im barely starting to " grow up " almost a year sober now . hopefully within the next few years i can experience that !
i really do like it here , my city isn ##t quite urban but its not rural either , ha ##rling ##en tx , cost of living is pretty low here and i think the weather is always nice .

i can relate , feeling lonely isn ' t a good thing . how are you coping with it ?
losing the companions ##hip of a friend really changes your routine . i ' n sure you ' ll find another friend and you won ' t be lonely .

ha ##ha , yeah that is great ! i am glad you enjoyed the thrill of riding one : )
i am great ! how are you doing today ?
why ? !
oh that is so great . is this her first ?
i ' m sorry for your loss .

that is extremely sad . that must have been difficult .
how old were you at the time ?
what a strange place for intro ##sp ##ection ! what did you learn ?
wow that ' s pretty fundamental to your personality , and a great thing to discover . i imagine the knowledge will help you throughout life .

a " u " grade ? yeah that ' s one that needs explaining
very cool , was it for a high school reunion ? hopefully it brought up good memories !
awesome ! hopefully you gave them the motivation they needed for the new year !
oh no ! what are you going to do ?
oh man . good luck !
i hate it when that happens . i don ' t feel like it is necessary to fl ##ake , they should be sure before they lead people along .
that ' s completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason . hopefully another interested buyer pops up soon .
aw ##w what a bum ##mer ! i am sorry to hear that , there are plenty of more jobs out there though , keep trying !
that does make such a difference , a job that you enjoy
that ' s great ! where did you get it from ?
is there somewhere special that you are going to wear it ?
that should be fun !

me too . that was very nice of what you did for that dog .
that ' s great . how did she do by the end of the day ?
oh , that ' s hard work , school and a job . it shows good work et ##hic though .
oh was he trying to be funny , or was he just creepy ?
wow that is somewhat disturbing ! i can ##t understand how people get such serious emotions for famous people .
oh wow ! are you happy about the purchase ?
i would be too ! what kind ?
i have seen things i can ' t explain . i didn ' t stick around to ask , i ran . but afterwards i was thinking it was a ghost .
that ' s scary . i ' m not sure what i would have done if that were me . what did you do ?
wow , that ' s scary . and i would have probably done the same thing .
oh , i ' m so sorry . how old was she ?
yes , it ' s nice that her struggle is over and she is in a wonderful place now .
do you still draw ? i was never talented in drawing .
oh i bet ! why did you stop drawing ?

awesome ! what happened ?
i love days like that , with two gets that would be the best day for me as well !
that ' s great ! was it kindergarten or pre - school ?
that ' s great ! did you cry when you took him ?
that ' s true . when my kids went to school the first day , i just kept standing around until one of the teachers finally told me i could go . . .
it ' s good that your standing up for your marriage like that . a lot of people aren ' t that committed .
you are a wonderful person then .
did it make you feel frightened ?
that ' s a shame , but sometimes it is good to face our fears .
oh no ! why do long ? did you walk ?
that stink ##s , but i am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery .
maybe he will understand , but just in case i ' d make him a new one .
don ' t feel bad , it happens to the best of us .
oh , wow . i hate it when people do things like that . they should just be honest and up ##front to begin with instead of causing drama .
i ' m sorry it fell through , but hopefully you will find something even better , and bonus , you won ' t have to deal with her .
ye ##a i hate the wait for aid and all the paperwork . hopefully it is resolved soon so you can ride comfortably .
hopefully the car holds up . i think you are playing it smart by having realistic expectation of when aid will arrive .
cool . what kind of instrument were they playing ?
maybe a uk ##ule ##le ? it ' s always fun to hear new music you like !
that ' s wonderful ! it sounds like you really care about each patient .
i bet ! i bet that job would be a lot on your physically as well as mentally .
sometimes things come up . it ' s hard to travel during the holidays . especially if your friend has kids .
maybe this year will be different .
dogs are really the best aren ' t they ? they are the greatest friends we can ask for .
he sounds wonderful and he sounds like he was a great companion and friend . : )
maybe you had a good reason to do this
i think he will fully understand and see it as no problem

you should of try to let it out slowly .
oh , that ' s terrible . what did you tell him ?
well that ' s good advice . i hope it worked out for him !
oh no . was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased . either way i ' m sorry to hear that .
i ' m sorry to heat that . that ' s something that can ' t be replaced .
that ' s very sad , i ' m sorry . i have had family members pass as well and it is never easy .
that poor woman . hopefully she is going to be all right .

u ##gh ! it ' s cool that she got a double so you guys can sit next to each ##oth ##er as well .
nice that it worked out so well for you ! what brand did you end up going with ?
wow , that ' s some high praise , i might just have to try it out myself !
oh heck no ! were you able to get back to sleep ?
e ##w , yeah i would have been in the same boat . did you go sleep on the couch after that ?
i suppose it is , but i wonder if the fact that you studied might have had more to do with it ?
well i am glad you got a good score . and faith is not a bad thing .
it is a good sign of po ##sit ##ivity i guess . .
yes . . only thing we should do is to be patience and the rest will be okay . .
oh really ! what did you do ? !
oh my goodness ! cong ##rat ##s ! how long were you two together before you took the plunge ?
oh wow ! i ' ve been waiting for 6 years for mine to throw a ring on this finger . still waiting ! lo ##l

that ' s pretty cool . i hope you get to go back .
how exciting . what do you plan on seeing while there ?
i am jealous . i love being out in nature
i had a cat named barney too ! we was a one - eyed grey tab ##by . what kind of or ##name ##nt is it ?
wow , that ' s quite a long life for a cat . i ' m glad you got to enjoy so many years with barney .
that ' s not a bad response , how did the team take it ?
that ' s great , did ya ##ll win ?
cong ##rat ##z !
that sounds bad . i know it wasn ' t intentional but what happened ?
well you did what you were supposed to do . it ' s their fault for saying what they said .
why ? were you mad ?
oh no ! that ##s embarrassing . i hope everyone was too drunk to remember . lo ##l
awe man that ##s the worst
that ##s really sucks
oh no , that ' s awful ! what happened to your dog ?
sorry to hear that . that must have been tough at that age .
that sounds terrible , but i ' m sure it ' s happened to other people before .
you shouldn ' t let one bad incident ruin water parks for you . you ' re probably the only one that remembers and still thinks about that incident .
what happened ? did you finish the project ?
wow , that sucks . sounds like it ' s your bosses fault . did he take the blame ?
well good luck with your future projects or your future job .
oh no ! hopefully that is the first time that has happened .
that is terrible ! especially since it was the whole day . are you planning to punish her ?
lo ##l . i love it . that is a great way to remind her of why she shouldn ' t lie .
i bet she won ' t do that again
help them move and then have them take you out to the brewery as thanks .
i don ' t drink so have a drink for me lo ##l .
lo ##l . thanks
oh man . was just talking to someone about that type of thing . i had a pet dog who was hit by a car back when i was in jr high . i have friends who have recently lost their lifelong pets and i know they ' re still reeling to some extent .
i will indeed . thank you . back at ya .
wow ! do you know what kind of car you ' re getting yet ?
that ' s amazing . i bet you can barely contain yourself !
i am very good
don ' t worry , i think everything will turn out right and your fears will disappear
was she wanting to go with friends ?
i know , you just never know how she will handle a dangerous situation . i talk to mine all the time about things that could happen .
pull what off ?
wow , that is so nice . you both should be really happy
yes , you have to put forth al ##ot of effort in order to see good result . good for her .
that ' s a long time ! you and your partner must really love each ##oth ##er .
i hope i have that one day ! i bet these next ten years are even better than your last .
it feels good to be in a new place , but the moving process sucks . is it a new part of town ?
i get that . my city is going through that right now too . i moved to the suburbs and love it so far .
hey , how are you ?
16 hours , that ##s a long time
im doing well
what cause the ac to go out
me too , it is to stress ##ing
wow , looks like you are ex ##tem ##ely organized , no offense
that ' s good ! it can sometimes be hard trusting others with expensive belongings .
that ' s great ! did she teach you how to drive ?
well , it is good that you did not marry him . i had a husband who cheated .
consider yourself very luck . a leopard never change his strips .
i bet you were embarrassed .
sounds like you learned to knock on the door first lo ##l .
did you mean rain ?
i like rain myself . we ' ve been getting a good amount here , during the past month or so .
we ' ve had an un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally mild summer . i ' m hoping it continues .
that ##s horrible , divorce is the last result .
are the kids old enough to understand what ##s going on ?
i guess that ##s a positive . they can understand that their life will be somewhat different
i remember that too , it ' s interesting transition ##ing to a more independent lifestyle .
that ' s great , i imagine that you still missed your family while getting involved and having new experiences .
that must have been frustrating . what did you do ?
that made me laugh . and you are a great baby ##sit ##ter .
that ' s terrible . did you confront your friend ?
i ' m sorry . i hope you can work things out without too much drama .
congratulations ! buying a car is a big investment . what was the first thing you did when you got your car .
i happy for you . buying a new car is a big deal .
oh no ! did they stick around to exchange info ?
oh good . at least they were responsible enough to that with you . i ' m glad your ok .
i love meat loaf
sounds good , what made you go low car ##b ?
ok , i do low car ##m too
you mean the kitchen staff ?
i try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when i go out to eat .
oh no ! do you have a suspect ?
i hope it turns up , or is returned to you soon .
she ' s ball ##ing hard , i ' m sure that her new toy will serve as motivation for you .
that ' s splendid and it should help you decide if you want an interior similar to hers or completely different in the future .
aw ##w ##w . i ' m sorry to hear that . are ##tha means a lot to you i see
i ' m sure . she was a very good singer .
aw ##w , my mom used to listen to her too ? did she sing along and dance like mine did too ? used to love that when i was little .
ain ' t that the truth ! miss those days .
why , what happened ?
that ' s a present that you love and it can love you back . that ' s the best present .
sometimes it ' s good to face our fears , or turn on every light in the house .
i don ' t i think could quit without the satisfaction of knowing how it ends .
that ' s awesome . my wife and i will hopefully be in that same boat soon . was he excited ?
that ' s awesome . i can ' t wait to experience it .
but i bet you feel all better now right ?
that ' s really good . everything went okay ?
wow , that ##s so awesome ! make sure you take care of yourself
these months will fly by so fast
yeah it might be a good idea to tell him . but you may want to have the money to give back to him first .
hopefully legal drugs . but either way i think you should tell him and give him his money . but you know your brother better than me .
hey that ' s awesome ! you won ' t have to steal money like me . which university was it ?
oh a christian university that is nice . well i needed my drugs
oh okay that ' s good . i should apply because of my diabetes insulin is expensive .
wow . did the other person know what was going on ?
well that ' s good . sounds like it all worked out pretty well .
that ' s good . i hope she found someone who treats her well .
that ' s really sweet . i bet your nervous though .
sibling rival ##ries are unfortunate . hopefully you two can patch things up one day ?
ah , i see . i hope you end up going and find a way to enjoy yourself . family is all that matters in the end .
that ' s great . any specific ##s ?
i ' m glad things are on the right track .
aw , that ' s sweet . what was it ?
that sounds way better than the stuff i would try to make for my mom when i was little !
oh no , how scary ! what did you do ?
i don ' t blame you , snakes are scary ! do you know what kind of snake it was ?
lo ##l , yi ##kes ! !
hopefully far , far away !

that ##s so awesome ! i want to get to that point some day .
that ' s awesome . i ' d be excited too . what are you going to get with it ?
that ' s fun . i just watched that move this weekend . i really enjoyed it .
is that uncomfortable for you ?
ok , well i hope it comes out ok for you .
cong ##rat ##s ! did they just come in and say hey guess what you ' re getting promoted
that ' s cool . guess all that hard work pays off !
i ' m sorry to hear that . do they know what the issue with his heart is .
that ' s good . i ' m glad it wasn ' t something urgent and he got to finish in the garden .
did your team not do so good ? i know mine sure didn ' t .
i like chicago . how bout you ?
nice , i like them too .
that would make me sad too . was there any reason she took your friend and not you ?
lo ##l , well that ##s rude ! hopefully you guys are better now ! little gr ##udge ##s like that stink , i like to just put them behind me and move on .
oh no . i hope that ' s not the end of the story . did you find it ?
that ' s sad , hopefully it finds its way home .
oh no , who mess ##es up bb ##q
probably bad meat
oh boy , was it someone you didn ' t want to talk to ?
you can never be too careful ! i ' ve heard too many things in the news . who did it end up being ?
ha ##ha good for you ! where were you ?
i hope you get the job !
my dear that ##s gross
oh i bet
yes that is annoying ! how long did you have to wait ?
wow , that ##s no fun at all . i guess you could look at it as money saved .
thanks ! lo ##l
very cool ! how old is she ?
that ' s incredibly thoughtful !
is it a stray or a pet ?
well that ' s nice of you . iv ##e always been a dog person myself .
oh me too . have you been saving up for a good one this year ?
very cool . i ' m looking forward to thanksgiving too . love turkey dinner .
yes family is my favorite part .
o ##oh ! i forgot about hot cocoa !
what changed your mind about the car
oh , i can see why now you ##ve had a change of heart about the car . that ##s awful
i would have been horrified
ah that is cool . good to get it while he is still performing .
for sure . not an avid listener , but definitely heard some of his stuff .
oh no ! did anyone come over to help or did you try to get out of there asa ##p ?
one thing i ' ve learned is that it might be embarrassing for a couple minutes but most of the time , an hour later , nobody will remember what happened .
i do love new sheets . the higher the thread count the bet ##te ,
what thread count did you go with ?
dan ##g . good job .
w ##he ##w , always a rough time . how do you think you did ?
for sure . were they hard ?
did you end up getting that job ?
oh awesome . i would have been nervous to if it was something i really wanted . glad you got the job .
yes that ' s the worst . and i laughed when i read that .
that had to be traumatic .
oh no ! that ' s awful , was anything valuable stolen ?
i ' m so sorry ! i would be so upset . did you file a report with the police ?
close call ! i would be pretty upset to lose my wallet .
wow , lucky it got turned in with cash in it . be more careful in the future ! ha ##h
exciting ! were you nervous going in ? did you take your test ?
cong ##rat ##s ! that had to feel good ! hopefully you ' re happy zip ##ping around the roads now ( and safe too ) !
that is very exciting , i bet you are nervous for your presentation . a lot is riding on it .
it is normal to feel nervous when working on something so important . i try to remember that it will soon be over . that helps me sleep .
that is scary ! have you been watching the weather ?
rain can be such a damp ##er . make sure to be safe and carry around an umbrella if you go anywhere !
i ' m sure if you can let people know that you ' re back blog ##ging , they ' d come back to see what you ' re up to now ! what do you blog about ?
that sounds amazing ! i haven ' t played tablet ##ops in forever . the last one i played was called " car wars " and it was at a new year ' s party . it was loads of fun !
that is terrible , i hope you were not hurt
too bad about your car but the main thing is that you were not injured .
that is nice , family is fun to be around
i hope he gets it
oh wow , i bet you were very scared . guessing you found your way ok ?
that ' s awesome ! i bet you were glad those people came along .
sounds like fun . when will you play ?
sounds like you will be well prepared .
oh my go ##sh ! ! ! that ' s pretty funny . did anyone see what happened ?
thankfully you had a sweater , but gee ##z how embarrassing .
girl , take that drink and don ' t be ashamed . at least you wouldn ' t have to pay for the drink !
that ' s when you say politely , i ' ll take the drink but not your number . nothing to feel guilty about since you would be using your manners .
that is really exciting , i bet it will be hard to let them go .
it is so exciting to watch them grow up , i am sure it will be an emotional moment . but it will be a good one .
were you looking for something in particular or just for fun ?
i bet it did ! were they photos of family or friends or all of the above ?
that is awesome ! congratulations . i can just imagine how excited you were .
you made your coach proud and your family .
how many years ago was it ? what happened ?
four years is such a long time ! its always the quiet ones you have to look out for ha ##ha .
i wish you both all the best in the future .
you must be really looking forward to that . sounds exciting !
oh yes enjoy the beautiful beaches and feel the sand between your toes , .
christmas is so much fun ! are you asking for anything in particular ?
oh wow ! that ' s a big gift ! i hope you receive it
that ' s great ! cong ##rat ##s to her ! i bet she worked hard .
i bet ! she ' s going to have so much fun
really , that is awesome . you will have fun
start planning now
that is so nice to hear ! you have a full house again ! did they have a good time ?
oh yeah ! i hear you ! a house full of kids is always crazy . ha ##ha
i would have passed out !
i would have ran to my car ! and hauled butt
why ? how much did you eat ?
wow ! was it good , anyway ##s ? maybe you could buy more ?
i ' m sorry . i now that must have been a let down . can you guys res ##ched ##ule ?
i bet you did . hopefully you can do something with her soon .
i ' m crossing my fingers for you .
oh no ! what happened ? did you get into an accident ?
that has happened to me before too . the car started swaying side to side from the rear tires but i just took my foot off the gas and let the car do what it wanted until i was able to stop . so scary ! i know how you feel .
oh , no ! i bet you were mad ! was she very sorry ?
siblings ! you love them but sometimes they can be such a pain !
sorry to hear that
yeah , i love my little fur baby too , that ##s really makes me sad to hear that
that is daring ! i do hope that you will win . what are the prizes ?
okay well . i wish you all the best of luck .
oh no ! that is horrible ! did you do anything ?
good for you ! animals need people like you ! very heroic !
oh yi ##kes ! is your dog ok ?
aw ##w ##w ##w , i am sorry to hear that . that is a terrible thing to experience . i hope that you are ok .
i am so sorry to hear about that , treasure the memories that you have about your dad .
it is such a good thing to have to have people around who helps .
i am happy for you and hopefully things will get better .
oh no ! what did you do about it ?
i can understand that , hope he was able to take care of it for you .
aw , that is terrible . hopefully you did not have much money inside . i guess the worst part is all the cards that have to be replaced . so sorry to hear this . : (
ou ##ch ! you know that you can replace all those cards online now . a bit easier than it used to be .
i agree with you on that one it can be very frustrating seeing that all the time
yeah i agree 100 percent . its not a good look to make someone look perfect when in reality nobody ' s perfect
that ' s a big change , adjusting well ?
nice , sometimes a change of scenery is good . i need to move out of this crap state .
ha ##ha i live in tn
nice , i have friends there , i live in la ##ver ##gne .
that is great news ! ! . . . . . . but a little scary at the same time . lo ##l
well you have to let them spread their wings at some point . : )
well that ' s a good sign . he knows you probably miss him and he wants you to know he ' s thinking about ##cha .
honestly , worrying about that kind of thing is human . literally everyone does it to some degree if they care about the other person , no matter how secure they say they are . so you ' re in good company !
oh , have they done the draw for that yet ?
oh , you would have been so excited and then disappointed ! i ' m sorry !
oh wow , i ' ve never heard of a dog dna test before . what is it ?
that is so cool ! is it expensive to do ?
i bet he does .
just sit him down and tell him .
don ' t be afraid ! you are smart . you are strong . you ' ve had enough .
good luck !
that is gross . did you find out who left it there ?
the old tuna sandwich .
well hopefully you threw it out .
maybe it tasted good as well .
oh that ' s awesome , how come ?
i hope you enjoy it ! where are you going ?
am ##en to that , food is better when you don ' t cook it .
om ##g , did you hurt yourself bad
lo ##l , i could imagine it to break the ice on your first day , you will always remember that day
lo ##l , too funny
i ' m pretty sure i ' ve done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life , so don ' t feel bad , lo ##l . he would probably laugh about it now if you told him .
what are brothers for , am i right ? the absolute best response to something like that at least between siblings is just to get that sweet pay ##back .
was it a good one ? did you keep it ?
is someone getting married , or a baby ?
well tell them i said cong ##rat ##s on whatever it is . as long as it ' s not a baby marriage .
keep it secret , keep it safe . . . .
cross country , that ##s awesome
im sure it is , this is when you put all your hard work into play
yep , keep your eye on the prize
wow , how amazing of your dad ! we ' re you surprised ?
it sounds like your dad really loves you ! to gift you something like that . : )
what type of cake was it . i love cake , wish i could have a slice .
it must have been very pretty and ta ##sty .
light ##ening and thunder has always scared me too . but rain is lovely . especially in the spring .
or how about on a tin roof ? that is the ultimate relaxation .
uh oh . . . . i ' m afraid to ask , how did it go ?
i lent my credit card to my sister one time and it did not go well . she still owes me to this day .
i am great how are you ?
sure , vent whatever you need .
oh did you try them on ? it ' s pretty normal , when my mom came home one day , she found me in her night ##go ##wn and high ##hee ##ls pretending i was going to her job .
well , if you feel that ' s truly you be honest , and if they can ' t handle it find someone who can .
oh really ?
do you feel overall that you worked harder than he had throughout school ?
i see . do you have any resentment ? have you done anything to take matters into your own hands to get where you ' d like to be ?
that ' s great . it seems like you ' ve only gotten stronger and that ' s an important trait to develop in life . be proud of what you can accomplish on your own and your ind ##ep ##end ##ance !
that ' s exciting ! are you happy to see him ?
how wonderful . i hope you two have a great time together .
that ' s awesome ! is he a starter ? i bet you were super proud of him !
good grades , good athletics , he sounds like a model kid ! i hope when i have kids that they turn out to be successful like yours . : )
oh that ' s awesome , was she paying it forward ?
it ' s always nice to get unexpected good surprises .
you must ' ve spent a while preparing . did you get the job ?
that ' s so awesome ! hopefully your ##e enjoying it ?
that ' s amazing ! where did you move to ? did you lose anything on the way ?
that ' s such an un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly satisfying thing , isn ' t it ? when you have just enough space to fit everything . i wish you the best of luck in outdoors ##man school . if i ever get lost in a national park , i ' m gonna be looking for you to come save me .
how com ##men ##dable ! congratulations ! that is a wonderful accomplishment .
yes you should be . giving back to communities is very charitable .
i live on a farm and take care of many animals . : )
oh gross ! did it feel slim ##y ?
i ' m sorry ! that would be unpleasant .
are you going to adopt him ?
i hope so . i always want to adopt all the dogs in shelters
oh wow , so it was extra money that was not yours ?
i hope she didn ' t get in trouble for being short $ 20 .
oh wow , that sounds super fun ! what color ?
i bet . i can ' t imagine anyone would mind having a car like that !
oh no ! sounds rough . what happened ?
wow ! that surely is frustrating . did you confront him ?
good , he better not ! hopefully the anger will fade .
oh that ' s great ! , was it a surprise ?
i ' m very happy for you , i ' m going to visit my mom next month actually .
i bet it was way easier and less of a pain that you anticipated it would be . are you ready for the rest of your work week now ?
nice ! well then i guess you don ' t have to be as worked about those meetings in the future then , huh ? piece of cake .
oh really , like what ?
oh man i super love mario ka ##rt ! i played it growing up a lot too .
what did you see ?
wow , that is pretty crazy ! what did you do ?
that ' s very brave . did you run into any obstacles ?
i ' m glad things have worked out for you .
it ' s always exciting when you know a package is on the way !
i love e ##bay ! i just found a doll that my daughter wanted for much cheaper than in the stores .
that is thoughtful . recycling is a great way to help the environment .
oh , that is a bum ##mer . oh well , everyone is entitled to do what they want
the hamburger ? those can be ta ##sty .
oh , well hamburger ##s aren ' t the health ##iest things .
why do you feel bad about it ?
that ' s unfortunate . do you have anyway of contact ##ing the buyer now ?
hey , that sounds wonderful . a puppy ?
i imagine , all pup ##pies are adorable and lo ##vable
what did you see ?
that ' s disgusting . i would never eat there again .
oh go ##sh , what did he do ?
oh my god ! is the child ok ?
i hope you don ' t have to put your friend down , accidents happen .
how did it go ?
cong ##rat ##s , they can really scare you at the doc ##to ##tr ##s .
oh , that sounds like fun ! has it been a long time since you have seen him ?
oh that sucks ! he doesn ' t sound like such a good friend i guess .
what happened ?
oh no . i hope it wasn ' t something dangerous .
aw ##w ##w man , yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up , and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again , but i ' m sure you can push through !
i ' m glad it ' s not all different though . i ' m sure the trainer will be really nice to train you because you sort of know what ' s going on , but just need a run down for the new responsibilities !
well hopefully the 4 days did good and hey guess ##es are 50 - 50 right .
i think you did fine , even if you had to guess you probably made an educated guess , hopefully your subconscious remembered more .
did anyone try to bid against him ?
wow , did he buy anything cool ?
ha ##ha , did you eat some ice cream ?
uh , oh , i think you might have been in trouble the next day .
wreck ##s can be a scary thing to just miss . was it the other persons fault ?
split second decisions save lives
that ##s cool . the n ##64 was a huge step up for enjoying your alone time for me .
i sold mine a long time ago and i regret it . : (
i should do that i don ' t know why i haven ' t
done ! lo ##l
oh no . did they catch the person ?
it ' s good that they were unsuccessful at least .
ha ##ha bikes can be very scary . did you lean the wrong why , i did that my first time .
oh nice ! he sounds like a cool dude . ha ##ha
bike ' s are a lot of fun i can see why he would be into them .
oh go ##sh , about what ?
oh no . so it was a horror movie , right ?
u ##gh . i hate horror movies . . i swear , i could be a grown 50 year old man , and still have trouble sleeping because of horror movies ! !
that was brave of her
wow , she must be really good . to quit herself .
why is that ?
everyone feels that way when comparing themselves at those things . except the po ##mp ##ous ones from school , those guys suck ha ##ha .
oh ##hh , i am sorry to hear that . i know your pain very well . are you ok ?
that is good . it sounds like you were able to be with her before she left . she is in a better place now .
i ' m so sorry to hear about your father . that ' s so awesome to hear about the support you received , though !
wow ! that ' s incredible ! what an awesome human being
anything you have in mind for you ?
well i hope your wants come to fruit ##ion .

ah screw them . live your own lives .
aw i hate when that happens . did they have a valid excuse to cancel ?
well hopefully you can get together with them again soon . i know it stink ##s to get excited about plans and then have them fall through .
ye ##a being alone can really get to someone head .
that ##s good ! have you thought about getting an outside job ?
well six months is a long time maybe you could get a seasonal job .
ha ##ha that could be fun ! like a haunted house one .
my mom can too , what did she do ?
sometimes our mothers forget , that you are adult and that ##s not her child .
would you ?
aren ##t they all !
oh no ! will he / she be ok ?
oh ##h i thought you literally left her . ha ##ha id ##k why .
lo ##l . too ##ts ha ##ha
that ' s awesome ! i ' m sure you are proud .
it takes commitment and sacrifice , hell i ' m proud of your brother too !
that is terrible . did you complain to the company and get a discount ?
yeah , moving can be so stress ##ful and expensive sometimes .
oh my go ##sh ! it isn ' t your fault ! ! !
i have ran over animals as well . it is an unfortunate reality .
do they understand it was an accident ?
it could be much worse . they could blame you and you would feel even worse . you should feel better with time .
oh how exciting ! where are you going ?
you are going to have such a great time and make memories you will cher ##ish the rest of your life
you enjoy it a lot of people never travel so be thankful for the experience and so ##ak up everything like a sponge
i would agree that you do , enjoy your trip !
where did you eat ? and what happened ?
i hate when that happens .
that sounds like a good game to watch ! did you have your friends over ?
i can imagine ! watching games can get wild sometimes !
that is excellent ! in what subject ?

yeah were i live he had roads closed for weeks trying to fix everything
yeah i hope we don ##t get another one of those again
oh , i don ' t like surprises . what did you do ?
tough love works sometimes .

that ' s terrible , i hope you apologized , or at least returned it and it was stolen for a good reason .
well you should if it ' s weighing on you .
what was wrong with it ?
oh that ' s so gross ! i would have sent it back too
its always disappointing to not achieve something you were hoping for but it could also mean that a better position is in store for you .
i am sure with that attitude that you will move up the ladder very soon , much luck .
i am sorry to hear that will you still be needed for your job ?
that ##s great i am sure you will achieve success there .
what was it like i have always wanted to live in a dorm and go to col ##led ##ge ?

i don ##t think i would have been brave enough to do that
that ' s a big accomplishment ! i bet your ' re proud .
that sounds like it will be so fun ! i bet you all have a fabulous time .
oh i ' m sorry to hear that , why ' s that ? : (

oh ye ##aa ##a do tell
ah snap !
fast ? like sonic the hedge ##hog ?
oh no ! we do need to hurry then don ' t we ?
i understand sometimes it uncomfortable to social ##ize , i get anxiety in social situations
sometimes its just a phase or maybe the group of people are not making an effort to make you feel included ? i am sorry i know how that feels .
that is great ! what is driving your happiness ?
it ' s always a blessing to have certain times in life where no problems are occurring !
that is so sweet of you
i bet you had no problems , dogs are easy to take care of , they blindly accept anything
oh boy , you okay ? how does that make you feel ?
absolutely ! trusting your partner is so important .
how do you think they went ?
i hope so too ! good luck . : d
it is annoying especially if in certain situations .

oh my goodness , i can only imagine how horrible that was for you .
neat ! what was the case ?
that is a victory ! those pe ##sky parking tickets can be a pain sometimes !
im sorry to hear that . what did you decide to do ?
yeah that seems like the best thing to do
being happy where your life is has got to be one of the best feelings . i ' m happy for you !
it ' s all about what you do with those bumps and just pushing through them i think .
that ' s a bum ##mer , i hope it was nothing serious happen to your car
that is good to hear , there are always kind people out there to help
oh my go ##sh , i ' m so sorry ! where are you staying now ?
i can ' t imagine what you ' re going through . that must be extremely hard .
u ##gh , that ##s the worst , especially when you just strictly looking . were you planning on buying ?
yeah . push ##y sales ##pe ##ople are so annoying though ! they accomplish the opposite of their goal when they become too over ##powering over their customers .
o no , i hope no one noticed
yeah i would not think about it to much .
that is good that you feel better ! what happened to change your perspective ?
i see ! well self - exploration and reflection is usually really productive !
im sorry , did you say anything to him " ?
yeah i would have yelled at him
that sounds fun . i ' m sure she knows you well enough to get you something that will suit you well .
that sound like a very useful gift that you ' ll use a lot in the course of a day .
i can imagine but it is good to get out
that is really cool , everyone should do something like that
that ##s so awesome cong ##rat ##s
my daughter just had her 2nd such happy

well that sounds like fun to me .
that sounds fun how long has it been since you have seen her ?

i ' m so sorry to hear that . you must be disappointed .
that ' s a great attitude to have ! po ##sit ##ivity is always a great quality to have .
hello ! how are you .
that ' s an incredible blessing that they love you . some people have different opinions about that so your lucky you come rom a supportive family .
oh no , were you polite to him ? it can be pretty frustrating .
oh no , is there any way you can file a complaint against him ? and it ' s the same guy ? ! so weird ! ! !
yeah i have a photo album and every time i look at it i smile
yeah i know but at ##lea ##st you have memories of him

that ##s sounds fun
oh wow ! that ' s impressive , those can be really hard to get .

oh wow . good for her ! does she have a great job to afford such a great lifestyle ?
i ' m sure that much be hard to stand by and watch as someone who works hard for their things .
i love sonic ! i used to go as a kid a lot as well . they have the best shakes .
i bet going to one again brought back a bunch of wonderful memories .
no idea ##r who that is but im sure you liked it
that ##s great
that ' s an unfortunate situation . what ' s the diagnosis ?
i see . he should probably get that checked out by a doctor . it ' s best to check out these things i think .
that is terrible to hear , hopefully you didn ' t in ##jure anything more than your pride .
well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brown ##ie points for trying to get to work quickly
wow im sorry to hear that
that is awesome ! im glad it worked out
are you tired , or do you have early plans tomorrow ?
oh , that ' s exciting ! there is nothing like relaxing on the porch in the evening .
oh , that ' s cool ! how many do you have ?
oh my ##y
oh i bet
sounds lovely ! i bet it brought back a lot of memories .
do you have fond memories of it >

what did you do !
yeah it must have been !
oh no ! are you okay ?
ou ##ch ! that sounds painful . you poor thing .
well it should be ok and don ' t feel guilty . two cookies are not that big of a deal
you may feel a little guilty and i understand that , maybe run to the store and pick up more ?
congratulations on getting that far ! what position is it ?
nice ! that is a good role ! do you like a leadership position ?
that ' s terrible , what ' s wrong ?
that ' s awful , i hope things get better for you .
is it a good one ?
tell me . i want to hear it .
that ' s no fair . your friend will never know .
why , what ' s wrong ?
and did it not go over well ?
were you able to find someone ?
well that ' s great , someone you trust too .
that sounds so sweet , it ' s always nice to look back on fond times .
sometimes all we have is our memories .
you ' re such a naughty person . what did she do ?
oh no . that didn ' t go well then . look for a ring next time .
what makes you feel lucky ?
that ' s so sweet of you !
im guessing you must have had a family me ##me ##ber die ? im so sorry for your loss .
that must be tough to deal with . i can ##t imagine losing a parent !
does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free ?
ta ##ht sounds lucrative ! i have a place in big sky mt . it worked out very well ##as far as rent ##ing .
why ' s that ? are you worried about driving ?
ah - ha ! do you know anyone in your family who ' s good at bargaining ? maybe the sales - person is a hard - bargain ##er .
wow , i wonder if she knew that you two were together . did she know that you saw her ?
she totally knew ! i guess it ' s flat ##tering to know your partner is good looking enough to have a woman stare him down like that .
i have been there , done that . i used to be a dog groom ##er and i love dogs . its so sad to go the pound and see all the homeless dogs .
i usually deal with it by not going to the pound anymore to look . i had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and i am just not ready for a dog .
i ' m such a scared ##y cat when it comes to scary movies . what was the movie about ?
oh go ##sh . that ' s terrifying ! i don ' t know anyone who likes those kind of movies ! !
wow . that is amazing , i love to change . what color did you choose ?
nice . i would like to do the same , but it is very expensive where i live . i hope i can afford it one day .
woo ! where are you headed ?
om ##g ! europe is my absolute favorite place in the world . i recently came back from italy and greece 2 months ago and loved it !
well , i went to venice , which i absolutely loved , but it was very crowded . i hear florence is beautiful too ! in greece , i recommend santo ##rini , or my ##kon ##os if you wanna party !
ya ##y ! it ' s beautiful . if you go , you will love it .
oh wow where you in the area when it happened ?
thank jesus ! lo ##l i am glad you are ok .
same . it ' s hard to predict .
how did you accomplish this ?
where do you keep everything ?
do you have some sort of method of organizing everything ?
how much stuff did you have to go through ?
well its always a good thing to keep a promise . can i ask what the promise was ?
well i app ##lau ##d your dedication and faithful ##ness in making sure you kept the promise , good job !
see things work out well when you make doing the right thing a priority . i am glad you followed through on it
ah its ok , we all am ##ke mistakes . are you in a new town ?
good ! i bet you got it down much faster after making a mistake .
did you move in a better home ?
wow that ' s so con ##vie ##nie ##nt .
well , at least you don ##t have to worry about him begin ok in life . he can take care of himself , now . you can give him tips on making better choices with his money
i understand . my little brother did too . . i have the family and he has the career . we are 10 years apart , but he make a ton more money than , i do . maybe you can get your brother to invest in homes , and you all start a business .
right , you should ! remember they aren ##t making any more land !
whole ##sal ##ing would be an great options . you could go on youtube and find tons of videos about flipping homes with no money . . but if your brother has a little change . . well . . go brother ! lo ##l
i will go out on a limb and say she didn ' t hold up her end , hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful
i understand the frustration a good garden takes time and patience , i have no doubt you will grow it back better than before
no problem i got faith in you , really enjoyed this chat
aw ##w ##w ##w . . what a heart warming moment . that was so sweet of you to do !
that ' s so cute ! turtles running around ? ! ha ##ha ! ! i have a rabbit , he loves to hop around my house too !
good luck . that sounds really frustrating . hope everything was backed up .
sounds like a good plan . i hope it ' s simple and you can get it working again .
do you have experience fixing computers ?
i hear you . technology is supposed to make things simpler . not always the case .
oh yeah ? nice to hear . what exactly did you do ?
that ' s awesome , i ' m from kansas and first went to colorado just a couple years ago . it was beautiful !
i agree though , always a good time to get away and explore some nature life .
well i ' m pleased to hear you had a fun time . hope you get to do it again soon .
what happened next ?
wow it must have been good feeling
oh man , i ' m so sorry . how did it happen ?
that is so sad . did you see it happen ?
o ##oh , sorry to hear that , was it by itself ?
sorry . probably the driver did not see her
wow . am happy for you , just commit to it and it will thrive
all the best
did you tell them to stop speaking ?
i bet . next time call the people in charge
oh , dear . did they pull you over ?
were you speeding ? i would have been nervous too .
i see . well , i hope all you got was a ticket .
o ##oo ##h , that ##s so scary and bad of them
that ##s worrying , she need help
my friend and i were out at the bars one night , doing the usual young people thing . they had been acting off a little all night , and when i asked if they were okay , they told me everything was fine . i knew this wasn ' t true since i had known this person for years , but the night came to a close and we got a cab home .
i ' m sorry you felt that way . is it any better now ?
your friend must trust and care for you a lot to con ##fide in you like that . how did you react ?
that ' s good . you must have been surprised by the confession .
wow ! i hope he doesn ' t do anything too crazy !
i hope you have as much fun as he does !
oh that ' s great . were you able to help him move ?
well at least you were able to introduce him to your friend . i hope everything works out for him !
sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind , who knows you might ace the test .
that stink ##s , cheer up and try again
hello , why what ##s happened ?
you founded the preacher helpful ?
i never did go to a preacher .
what was the secret about ?
i won ' t tell anyone ! come on , just one juicy detail ? ?
i am really sorry to hear that . how are you healing from it ?
that ' s good . i ' m glad you had good doctors to help you get back on your feet ( no pun intended ) . are you having o be out of work ?
i mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party . it ' s pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way .
you should ' ve made them buy another cake !
that ##s great , are you enjoying it ?
that ##s awesome , im glad they were helpful !
oh i ' m so socially awkward and anxious i ' d never be able to give a speech . how did it turn out ?
i ' m so happy to hear that ! practice does make perfect .
oh i am so sorry to hear that . : ( i hope that she will be alright . is it serious ?
oh no ! well you better spend as much time with her as you can now . it could be any time she leaves . oh what a heard situation you are going through ! if you need a friend i am always here for you .
that ' s very lucky , how much was it for ?
yeah i can understand , it ' s definitely a pleasant surprise .
that ' s good to be able to depend on others .
that ' s so true , life is very fragile and i find it easy to forget that .
it ' s nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you . is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty ?
why did you choose to stay ?
food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes . don ##t give up !
om ##g ! okay now i understand how difficult it really must be for you !
oh my that must have been frightening ! poor little cat , what happened afterwards ?
i can just imagine , maybe she wanted a bath . glad to know she wasn ' t harmed .
that soul ##d make me feel sad . did you talk to him about it ?
that ' s not very nice . i think it is just better to be honest , even if it might hurt .
i certainly know that feeling .
you can always improve that anytime you want to . i have faith in you .
do you plan on paying him back quickly ?
i mean its pretty crap ##py to take anything from anyone , but he ##s your brother so it is slightly less crap ##py as long as you pay him back !
uh oh . i ' m sorry to hear that . that is never a good thing to do as a supervisor .
unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue . again , i wish you had been treated so un ##kind ##ly .
something juicy i hope .
who ##ops ! did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor ?
oh no ! i am afraid to ask what it was . . . . but what was it ?
yu ##ck ! you better put a trap up there . you know they have these wireless web cam ##s these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an in ##fest ##ation .
oh dear . is it what i am thinking ? did she wreck it ?
i am so sorry to hear about that . the good thing is she is okay
i would be upset as well
wow , that ' s really great that they pitched in to help . you must be happy about that !
the more hands , the quicker the work !
making moves to do better is all you can do . how has it been going ?
that is great ! the longer you do it the easier it will get . keep up the good work !
no problem !
what were you invited to speak about ?
it ' s hard to conde ##nse a pep talk into nice little one liner ##s . but i think if you just go for it , breathe deeply a bunch , and pretend it ' s just you in that room , i think you ' ll do great !
i hate to ask what happen , i imagine something went wrong
that is the problem with cheating , you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious , all i can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time
had she been bothering you recently ?
i get that . i don ' t respond well when people are rude to me .
what a pain ! i think when a big company makes so much money and they say they '
o ##ops , sorry , i didn ' t finish my thought . i think they make enough money to handle it and that inc ##on ##ven ##ience is worth $ 80 . plus now you ' ll definitely buy again with them so i think it works in their favor and yours !
that ' s awesome . it ' s wonderful to feel prepared !
now you just have to keep up that same energy all year , that ' s the difficult part .
cong ##rad ##ulation ##s . you must be excited and proud . are you enjoying the new car ?
oh no ! hopefully you have full coverage ?
yeah but , its better than having no car !
does your insurance have the " new care replacement " option ?
that is great ! when is the wedding ?
are you having a bachelor party ?
the best kind of bachelor party . that is exactly what i did for mine . . . 20 years ago .
you should make it an annual trip ! then you can always be reminded of a good time in your life .
how much did she give you over
most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened
that sounds like he startled you quite a bit , hope it wasn ' t a black cat .
aw ##w ##w well other than the heart attack giving sounds like a cute cat
i am sorry to hear that . how did that make you feel ?
i feel your pain . i hope you had someone to lean on .
i have not seen the message about the incident but i do hope that person will speak to you .
that was the right thing to do . you respect your marriage .
awesome . i love my mate too . that cow ##or ##ker is very out of order !
i ' m sorry you had to go through all that stress . but ya ##y for you being able to leave that situation !
that ' s great to hear . it sounds like it ' s a well needed change . things will look up from here !
do you trust your friend ?
that ' s great . its good to have a friend you can trust that much .
would it be a promotion ?
i hope you make the right choice !
that is a pretty weird thing to have happen
maybe you should contact the news about it
sounds like somebody needs an account ##abi ##li - buddy . . .
wow you should probably tell her so that lies and decent don ' t become commonplace in your marriage .
that is not ok to do .
yeah people like that are jerk ##s
he must have been very excited ! that is awesome .
ah . you must do it more often . children are so precious .
oh no ! did they take you to jail ?
yeah , i wouldn ' t feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself .
oh my , it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time
i can understand why it would be a little nerve wr ##ack ##ing but i am glad you caught up with him
sounds scary . did you find out what it was ?
were there any recent events in your neighborhood that would make you worry ?
you should go to their place
that is sad that they can ##t at ##lea ##st talk to you
oh no ! they are mean to not have told you . i would ' ve told you . how did it even get there ?
o ##ops ! well , just hold your head high because things happen to all of us and it doesn ' t speak to who you are as a person so just let it roll off your chest . shame that people are decent enough to help .
hey , i bet you ' ll do great ! nothing to stress about .
just try to stay positive and get a good night ' s rest the night before and i ' m sure you ' ll do amazing ! just have to go in with confidence .
wow , you must really be excited . do you have room for it in your kitchen ?
that sounds delicious ! can i come over ?
congratulations on the good raising of the kid ! i bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories .
wow that is so sweet . have you shown her it yet ?
that just warm ##s my heart , thank you for telling me that .
hail can be freak ##y ! was there any damage ?
we don ' t get them too often , here . though there ' s usually a few tornadoes that touch down somewhere in the area , each year .
i bet that was nice though .
does your high school do reunion ##s where you could see them again ?
wow , what happened next , is he alright ?
wow what type of dog is he ? is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love ?
wow , i actually love them ! did you take him to see a vet ? you seem so concerned about him to even take time off work .
i am so glad to hear that . a healthy puppy makes everyone happy .
nice ! what did you end up with ?
i say if you can afford it enjoy it . what is your favorite feature ?
i haven ' t , but i would love to get one . i love full feature phones !
everything about getting something new like that is fun !
you must be very fond of such memories . do they make you feel nos ##tal ##gic ?
its always good to think about such moments , i wish i could go back to these times .
wow , he did he do ?
you must be so proud of him !
what am amazing feeling that must be ! did it take you a long time ? must have felt so satisfying .
its paying off ! that ' s awesome . how much can you bench ?
i agree ! is she excited ?
ha ##ha , good for her ! she is become ##ing more independent ! do you know what kind of car ?
feeling sentimental much ?
i know how you feel . i ' ve got old rifles from both of my grand fathers . . . along with some w ##w ii bring backs . i don ' t think i could sell them .
sorry to hear that . i hope you ' re not feeling too sad .
i had no idea snakes even lived that long . i am sure he was a faithful buddy to you .
maybe its time to find a new job ?
awesome . are you feeling a little jealous ?
don ' t worry , i ' m sure she ' ll put a dent in it before the month is up .
you should take a ride with her and try to get her to para ##le ##ll park in a tight space or something
oh my goodness . that ##s so cool . who did you show it to .
wow , love looking through memorable s . brings back good memories .
yeah , tell me about it . i have nothing from that far back from my family .
i will . i bet my aunt has some things to give me .
yeah , i know what you mean . coffee always cure ##s my headache . but then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too .
i wish i could say the same . i am addicted . : (
why not ? is everything okay ?
that must be somewhat frustrating at times .
oh that is awful . the loss of a pet is just the worst
i hope it starts to not hurt so much . i always take forever to stop hurting from those things .
it is good to have people you can count on . if you can ' t trust your family , who can you trust ? : )
totally ! i also have a very trusting family .
that ' s unfortunate . i hope you didn ' t get chewed out too badly .
i guess they don ' t see it as just copy paper . to them stealing is stealing no matter how petty . at least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job .
sorry to hear that , it must be absolutely devastating . but you must stay strong .
i am glad you have all the support you need . the important thing is your family is safe .
what ? oh no ! can they do that ? i would fight it and see what happened . you must feel sick .
i am so sorry . that is awful . definitely look into your rights as an accepted student who was counting on that and made all your plans around it .
oh no ! i take they still got their claws . mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining .
oh my goodness . they got a taste of it and went to town . i ' m so sorry .
yep , that ##s what i did with the chair mine messed up pretty bad .
yeah i ' ve gone a few times actually . do you like them ?
that ' s awesome ! i wish you all the luck , but i bet you won ' t even need it .
it ' s going to knock everyone dead ! i ' ll be root ##ing for you
o ##ops ! do you think that you can replace it ?
oh know . i am sure your mother will forgive you . i was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes .
that was nice of you to do . what kind of dog does she have ?
i love dogs ! i am thinking of getting another one .
oh my , do you have a draft saved . or was that the only copy ?
it must have been so ag ##gra ##vating . i hope the due date wasn ' t the next day !
that ' s amazing ! did you get i ?
waiting is the worst ! well , whatever happens is meant to be . i wish you luck and success with your house !
that ' s really great . you ' re setting a good example for your kids , too .
that ' s really great ! your kids will thank you for giving them that important lesson .
that is a good place to be . are you happy with your job ?
i ' m sure it will !
yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys !
aw i am sure you will be good parent to all of them . kids are the greatest joy in life .
really ? that must be fun
that is so nice i wish i had a car like that .
u ##gh do you have any security camera that might have captured what happened ?
i hope so too . its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day .
i hope you do very well ! what subject ?
i think you will do great !
ha ##ha ! that definitely must have scared many people that did not know what it was . that must be hilarious to watch !
ha ##ha ##ha i can imagine ! i guess i would have done the same . i hope you got him back . hee ##hee
and you know when men get sick , they ' re on their death bed .
and you know when men get sick , they act like they are dying .
i ' m sorry about that . what happened ?
wow , that stink ##s . hopefully she will be there for you next time if you ever need help again .
i am sorry to hear that .
it must be very difficult for you . do you have someone you can talk to about it ? i find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive .
that ' s great . it ' s nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down .
awesome ! what are your plans for this weekend .
that is wonderful . i will be spending time at home .
that is so sweet . family is very important
that ' s awesome ! what show ?
that ' s an interesting experience !
has she had a history of illness ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . 10 is still very young though so i hope you have plenty of more time to spend with her .
i have some of that too . it would make me a little nervous .
u ##gh , well i hope the best for you , that it is all nice and intact when you get back .
really ? why you should have been patient .
oh dear . maybe you were just a bit impatient but i am sure he will forgive you
wow ! that is really cool ! what will you buy ?
have fun spending it !
that must have been embarrassing , wasn ##t it ?
did you re ##tal ##iate against your boss ?
was it a prestigious or expensive vase ?
looks like it was just an accident . it happens and you shouldn ' t blame yourself for it .
great , since you are prepared i ' m sure you will do great !
if you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most , but you certainly seem very prepared .
it ' s very scary ! i live near the coast too ! i don ' t know if my home will still be here in 50 years .
no , i ' m not . i ' m hopeful that the den ##iers will start to come to their senses and maybe we can slow the warming of the earth .
i am so glad to hear everything is going well for you ! . it is good to hear your health is improving .
that is a long time to suffer . it seems like it is a new day for you .
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! is she okay ? that is so great that she has you .
i agree . be there no matter what . i hope she heal ##s quickly .
that ' s good that you trusted him . sometimes i miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust .
that ' s awesome . that ' s a good amount for a little effort which is always nice .
your intuition seems to be trust ##ful and the right way to go
must be great to have that feeling of accomplishment and independent .
ha ##ha . . . you little thief ! ( joking ) that must have been some good pizza !
ah ##hh , oh well . don ' t beat yourself up . i am pretty sure that i have done something like that before too . i think it was with birthday cake . i love birthday cake ! ! ! ! !
ha ##ha ! no ! it ' s not wrong ! my son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ball ##fields !
it ' s a huge commitment for him and you ! if you don ' t think you can do it , i wouldn ' t sign him up . there ' s no shame in that !
wow ! how did it go ?
that must have made you feel pretty nos ##tal ##gic !
that would really stress me out
that is just the worst feeling . part of the reason i work from home
oh they need to take care of that asa ##p !
well for your sake i hope it gets taken care of soon .
that awful ! were you able to continue without it ? that must have really messed up your rhythm .
did it start back up ? glad you were able to start over .
you are a good friend .
yes they deserve respect unless they do so ##em ##thing cruel .
why did he move so far away ?
that ' s very sad . i ' m sure he ' ll be back to visit .
i hope your mom can understand , it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes
lo ##l , well hope she doesn ##t notice
was it a good feeling or a bad feeling ?
i do too . being a kid was so easy .
also not having a ton of res ##pon ##si ##bil ##ites !
yeah i completely understand that .
oh man , that ' s a long break . how did it go ?
that ' s great ! did your co workers help ?
ha ##ha ##ha that ' s funny . my bad , i feel like i need to hit the gym again as well .
ye ##a it sucks to go but feels great once you leave .
what did you get up to in august usually ?
i used to love bonfire ##s back in my day those were the days .
agreed , what was your favorite memory ?
whoa that ' s out of left field , how ' d that happen .
good for you ! are you going to tell your girlfriend about it ?
you are an honest man as well . i salute you ! a rare breed indeed .
aw ##w , so cute ! i bet your having such a fun time with him / her !
wow i didn ' t know you could litter train rabbits . it ' s always challenging house training a new pet . i hope he learns quick !
oh no ! how gross ! that must have been so embarrassing ! were you able to clean yourself up ?
i can imagine . i would have lost my appetite for sure . that is a crazy story !
what city are they moving to ?
that is about as far away as you can move , i am sorry to hear that , hope everything works out !
glad to hear that , i hope you continue to be faithful to her in the future .
i agree , is you are not happy in a relationship anymore you should first end it and only after be with someone else .
did you buy it all by yourself ?
ha ##ha , so you told a fi ##b . ain ' t nothing wrong with that .
did you fall a lot ?
well have fun on the triple black diamond !
i love haunted houses ! did you go alone ?
that sounds like a great time ! it ' s always good to do those things with friends .
u ##gh you need to tell him to return those things and tidy up the house .
he might just be bluff ##ing . unless someone broke into your house ?
was a neighborhood you frequented ?
that must have been a nice moment .
how did that make you feel ?
i understand that , i get that could make you emotional , i hope time slow ##s for you !
i am sorry to hear of your grandmother ' s passing . my condo ##lence ##s to you and your family .
death can be very hard on families .
oh , i ' m so sorry . was it unexpected ?
that ' s horrible . please accept my condo ##lence ##s for you and his family . take care of yourselves and let yourselves gr ##ie ##ve .
oh no ! those little ones seem to do stuff like that all the time .
did you try this stuff called " goo ##f off " ? give that a try or some vinegar .
oh cool . i love looking through my old photos . makes me feel warm and fuzzy .
me too . i love to ponder about the good ole days . did you share the photos with your friends or parents ?
oh no , did it burn ?
i hate when i do that , but it is better for it to be cooked to long , than not long enough . . . .
that must of been fun , where did you meet ?
that is amazing . i hope i can get the family together soon .
oh no , that ' s terrible . is there anyway to red ##o it ?
you better prepare well for that final .
that sounds amazing , i hope they enjoy it a lot !
it sounds like it will , i hope you have a great dinner !
that ' s wonderful ! are you thinking of proposing ?
that ' s a good thing to be financially prepared , trust me . my husband and i spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way . you ' re smart !
wow ##za ! that is a good spouse . were you su ##pr ##ised ?
good i bet you deserved it . : )
that is not good . did they give you back your money ?
i would be upset too , they need to do their work properly .
i am glad that you got it cleared up .
i hope so too , you should have reported it to a supervisor or manager .
why ? are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money ?
well i guess you should probably find a new job before quit ##ting your present job .
i have had that happen before and it is super annoying !
i do not blame you one bit !
i used to get chased by dogs too , back then when i was younger fences were not to common
lucky you , i was bit a few times but it was my fault i provoked the dogs
that sounds fun ! the arcade ##s were always kind of noisy for me though .
you should go in a play some !
oh , that ' s so hard ! how are you feeling about it ? it ##ching to go back , or dread ##ing it ?
that ' s good ! at least it ' s someone you can trust instead of a stranger at a day ##care center .
ou ##ch ! what did they do for it ?
that sounds so painful ! i hope it gets better fast .
that can be nerve wr ##ack ##ing . are you worried ?
ah . i find a mock interview with a friend can help .
good luck !
that is smart of you . how did it go ?
i am sure you will be ok . the doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that aren ' t worth it .
that is so sad to hear , it must be tough for you
wow that is a long time , but remember you had great experience with her and will have fond memories for the rest of you life
good job ! hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are !
i can ' t help but be a little jealous . ha ##ha
its possible she is just trying to be helpful .
i can see how that would be really annoying . just nod and say yeah . that ##s what works for me .
did he live up to the belief ?
that ' s great ! i ' m sure he appreciated that you trusted him .
how exciting for you . kids truly are amazing . now the fun really starts .
now you will have to really be careful what you say around him . they tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it .
that is great ! cong ##rat ##s !
i bet you are so happy you stuck with it . . definitely something to be proud of .
aw , will you be able to keep her company ?
that is very thoughtful of you . you are a good sister !
aw , nice ! that ' s kind of cool , actually . i hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well . sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff , so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great .
yeah , i think her parents or her peers , or even herself probably , may put a lot of expectations on her . while you want to reassure and encourage her , it ' s good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her . it ' s what my parents did with me , and i resented them for it .
i not sure what do you mean , but can use my imagination , it sounds like something really embarrassing .
yes what i thought , i guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed .
dan ##g , i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homes ##ick .
at least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact .
i feel like this is me . i ' m clean , but i ' m stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn ' t do dishes . and i also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with . sorry you have to deal with that , because i know i hate living in it !
me either . i ' ve always been a fairly clean person . had to move out of my parents home for college , and both roommate ##s i ' ve had have been kind of messy . i don ' t know how people don ' t feel weird and uncomfortable making other people live in / clean up their mess .
oh no ! that can be very scary ! did you make it out ok ?
was it a stranger or someone you knew ?
ha ##ha wow , that ##s cool .
oh really , what was the play ?
that is awesome , i remember ode ##ll beck ##ham doing that a few years ago .
that ' s horrible . i ' d talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly .
if your best friend is truly a best friend of yours , they won ' t leave you over this . it isn ' t right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion , but it is good if you speak to him about the situation .
who ##op who ##op ! thanks for reminding me . i have to purchase youtube live for it .
same here ! who is your team ?
nice ! i as ##dly am a corn hu ##ske ##r . it ' s been a rough couple of years .
that must have been so fun !
it sounds like you have a great family !
i guarantee that you will be fine ! i graduated with a master ' s last year
environmental engineering - my second engineering degree
that ' s wonderful news . i have also battled depression and am feeling better now . that is a real big deal .
wow ! cong ##rat ##s and keep it up . i know it helps me to stay really busy .
that ##s nice to hear . its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit .
aw it must have felt so nos ##tal ##gic going through old memories . its nice to cher ##ish them .
do you miss him ?
be sure to face ##time or sky ##pe with him . that will help with the loneliness .
oh no , that ' s terrible . is he in legal trouble ?
this is such a difficult thing for you to go through . i hope he learns from this and changes his path .
how come ?
i understand . but you must cher ##ish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults .
oh , that is horrible . i am sorry that happened to you !
i don ' t blame you , i wouldn ' t want to mess with that either .
why is that , might i ask ? maybe i can help you ref ##ram ##e it better to look at it more positively .
oh , i see . yeah , it kind of stink ##s being around people who can afford things you would like . but maybe you can view it as you being more mind ##ful and responsible with your money .
that ' s very lucky of you , what do you plan on doing now ?
if you did have to move , might i suggest boston as an alternative ?
don ' t be nervous . i am sure you did alright . it is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head .
oh good , then there is nothing you should be worried about then . : ) go relax and distract your mind on something else . all will work out my friend .
i hope you feel better soon . maybe you can take a trip out to visit her ?
i bet she really misses you . how far away did you move ?
oh wow , that ' s really far ! well i hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip !
ye ##a that can be tough . what kind of dogs ? are they easy to train ?
yu ##p . i did that with my new cat and it ended up working out ok .
yu ##p ! i am sure you guys will get through it !
i can understand the anxiety , i ' m sure you ' ll do fine though !
sleep is so important before an exam , that ' s where all your facts and memories get better organized
is it possible to re - arrange the date to when the weather would be more favorable ?
i see . you shouldn ' t let it spoil your plans . go and have fun but take a rain coat with you !
you sound like a good friend , going through the effort and trouble to fix that up . i ' m not into surprises , but i ' m sure you know your friend well enough to know that he ' d like it if you gave him one .
it ' s going to be really easy to see that he is special to you guys after tonight . i wish i had a friend like you , even though i don ' t like surprises . you should be proud of yourself . i hope it goes smoothly !
i ' m the same way with my wife , i trust her .
that ##s a good feeling , i wish ya ##ll the best
i hear you . you always have to have faith in your team .
i sure am . im a new orleans saints fan . im hoping for a good year also .
you must be feeling excited !
wow . that is a long time to be waiting for a movie .
oh that is so sweet .
flowers are definitely beautiful .
kids can be so hurt ##ful , be happy about who you are !
i ' m sorry about that ! hopefully that kid has learned better by now
who are the braves ?
ah great . good luck . are they good ?
it can be pretty scary getting ready for a new environment . but i am sure after the first day it will be gone .
i ' m sure you will ! i bet you will do great things after school !
oh no , what happened ?
that is so scary , i am glad that you are okay ! people are so crazy ! ! !
i love going back to my hometown . its a good feeling being back . what are you most excited about ?
i have never been . i would love to though . i hope you have a great time back at home .
wow ! why would you cancel ? is it a good opportunity ?
well that ' s your choice , but i say new adventures in life are profitable !
i understand . they are so cute when they are todd ##ler . how old he is now ?
great : )
that is scary ! what is the problem ?
oh im sorry to hear that ! i hope it all works out for the best !
that sucks . i have had that happen . it did not feel good .
sounds like you deserved that promotion .
that is awesome ! groceries can be expensive , so that was a blessing .
that is very helpful ! i am glad you were able to get that discount .
oh wow ! congratulations to your aunt ! what did she major in ?
she must be very intelligent ! i hear that is one of the hardest degrees to get . incredible !
what kind of surgery is she having ?
sounds painful , hopefully she recover ##s well
i love vacation ! where are you going ?
that sounds so lovely
ha ##ha that ' s pretty cool . is he a gym ##nas ##ist ?
me neither ! that is pretty cool . i fun party trick ha ##ha
that is cool , you must be really anticipating this visit
i bet both of you will have a blast together , don ' t have too much fun ; )
that ' s so sweet ! i love my family too ! what are some things you like to do together ?
that sounds like fun ! we like to play baseball and go to the beach ! family time is great !
that is great . i hope you get it . what is the job title ?
good luck
oh no ! that ' s a terrible feeling . did you go home ?
i bet the next morning was rough !
that ##s great ! cong ##rat ##s on retirement !
what did you do ?
that is good news ! my life is also going great !
im happy for you !
that is wonderful to hear .
not anymore , but it is so great to hear that it is possible to find happiness !
what color was it ?
i bet it was nice ! i like them too
i do too ! they are very talented !
that is what makes them so special !
was it a gunshot ?
that is scary ! i live by a gun range and hear them all the time
i agree , are you looking forward to them winning some silver ##ware ?
yep , and i think they will be playing fantastic ##ally well . no one stands a chance !
sorry to hear that . it must be sad for you but remember he will always be with you in your heart
once you ' re ready , adopt a dog from the shelter in his honor .
i am so jealous ! so i am guessing it was worth the price ?
when did you get it ?
that is wonderful . i do hope that you will win
unfortunately i don ' t but i have a brother who loves to play it .
oh no that ##s embarrassing . did anyone see ?
i ' m sorry to hear that ! are you ok ?
i hope it goes well ! are there any prizes for creating the best draft ?
that ' s a lot of money . best of luck to you !
ah ##h . . i ' m jealous . that sounds relaxing ! what do you normally do that keeps you so busy ?
i ' m glad you have time to relax . . this week was my first week of school so i ' m relaxing too now that its friday !
i ' m a sophomore in college trying to get into a good nursing program !
that ' s so cool ! i ' d like to work in a hospital some day . but for now . . we can finally relax because it ' s the weekend ! !
that ' s great ! cong ##rat ##s . which class ?
or you really know it ! i was never great at science , sad to say !
i loved history but couldn ' t really get a great job with that ! exact opposite of what you are doing .
figures , right ?
is something wrong ?
that ##s awesome ! i hope that feeling continues !
you must feel prepared now since you ' ve done all your planning and analysis .
its a big ambition but you can do it with the right effort and commitment !
it would certainly make me furious if i witnessed that . have you witnessed such an act recently ?
the news can be so dark and de ##pressing at times .
i bet you ' ll do fine . you are probably just nervous .
it is alright . being paranoid has its benefits . it will make you study more .
glad to hear it . you are lucky to have such an amazing family .
that is the best thing to have in life . not much else matters in my opinion .
that
i ' m sorry ! i meant to say that was so sweet of you . it ' s good that he has a good friend like you .
that is cute . how old are they ?
are they males or females ?
oh that sucks ! how are you feeling about that ?
understand ##ably so . but hey , we all make mistakes and failing one class isn ' t the end of the world . in fact i failed calculus 3 this semester . so take pride in what you have accomplished and just work hard next semester !
what movie was it ?
i haven ' t , but i will check it out !
finally , someone that sees it ! everyone around me disagree ##s but i have hope .
it is great , i ' m excited to see what the future has to offer .
i ' d be furious if i witnessed such a thing too . have you witnessed such an act like that lately ?
i wonder how a person can do that to a child .
ha ##ha . sorry to laugh but you said it in a funny way . are you ok ?
dan ##g , i have doe ##n the same . it can be pretty em ##bar ##ras ##ing .
oh , i am sorry ! did it turn out ok ?
aw ##w , that ' s too bad . i hope you don ' t have to fly a lot .
yeah , driving is sometimes not an option . how long is that flight ? i hope short !
u ##gh , that ' s not great though . but , yes , it could be a lot worse like across the country long .
what would you have done with the money ?
good for you , you have your priorities straight !
holy cow , that is a bad to the bone car !
it is still a bug ##att ##i ! ! !
surprise cake is the best . what flavor was it ?
very nice , you should hold onto that girl . did you ask her to marry you on the spot ?
wait what does that mean what i think it means ?
im sorry to hear that
aw , that is so nice of you , i bet they really appreciated it .
not a whole lot you can do besides make their day a little better which you have already done . they ' re in there to heal or get better hopefully .
oh , i ' m so sorry . i hope she ' ll be okay .
i ' m sure her doctors will do a good job .
how did you do when you took them ?
cong ##rat ##s ! what college did you choose ?
i hear you . sometimes the realities and brutal nature of the world is hard to learn and know about . almost makes you want to be ignorant to it all . did you recently encounter this ?
yeah , it ' s also kind of disgusting how much the news plays those stories up , because they know it garner ##s views . the kind of " if it bleed ##s , it leads " idea . but i guess we ' re the people that eat it up and make them do that .
i feel for you ! bad roommate ##s are the worst
you are right being that age he will probably never change
i wouldn ' t stress so much if i were you . everyone has to try something new for the first time and not everyone gets stuff right away .
i get anxiety too . i can be really hard to deal with it sometimes . i just have to " fake it until you make it , " and power through ti until i gain confidence .
im sorry , there ##s nothing worse than that . i hope you ' re doing okay
im sorry . it eventually gets better though
that ##s nice to hear , too many relationships ending nowadays
wow that ##s awesome good for you
oh no ! i ' m so sad to hear that : (
yeah that ' s all you can do i guess . do you do anything cool in his memory ?
oh no did he / she get better ? did you have to take them to the vet ?
oh dan ##g , there were multiple cats that were sick ?
same , cats are so awesome
ha ##ha mine loves to just lay on me and get pets , he ##s so soft and cute
he ##s a rag doll with blue eyes and a white coat that ends in gray on his face tail and paws , what about yours ?
that ##s nice thank you for telling me about your cat
you must be so excited ! what game did you get ?
that actually got great reviews . i am sure you are going to love it !
that ' s unfortunate . did you have the flu ?
your next adventure will go much smooth ##er . i once got a really bad rash in hawaii when i visited .
that ' s awesome , where did you go ?
i love california , i have some family in sacramento ! and i bet it feels great to be home after a long drive .
oh my go ##sh . i am sorry . that can be really tough .
that ##s the most important thing . i bet he wants you to move on and be happy .
ha ##ha that ' s really cool ! what kind of watch is it ?
oh nice . ye ##a he would be happy to know you are wearing it now . \
oh no . did the workers have to come clean it up ?
i bet you were a little embarrassed . i wouldn ##t worry too much about it . im sure it happens everyday .
that is so nice ! did you get lots of presents ?
so fun . did you have your baby ? congratulations on your pregnancy !
ah ##h sounds like some great memories . do you often feel nos ##tal ##gic about these times ?
that ##s a great idea . that way your kids will get to experience such lovely moments as well .
wow , lucky you . i hope you are enjoying your time there . they will be app ##re ##cia ##tive of the gifts .
how much longer are you staying for ?
to have some rest after working so hard , it is very important .
it is a perfect leisure activity .
that sucks ! it happens to the best of us . at least the computer didn ' t break .
yeah , that would have been an expensive accident ! your lucky . : )

aw ##w that ##s a great time in life .

those are nice cars ! i hope you are able to get one !
oh no , what ' s wrong with your current car ?
that sounds terrible . i ' m sorry i can ' t dia ##gno ##se a car over the internet though . my first guess for that is usually the battery . then things like the cables or the starter or fuse ##s .
that is awesome . what type of dog do you have ?
my mother - in - law has one , too .
what are you going to do for his birthday
i love birthday gathers
what career do you work in ?

math is not my favorite . can you ask the teacher / professor ?
that is terrible , i am sorry ! hopefully you ##ll be able to get it taken care of this time .
what type of degree are you getting ?
ye ##a those shows are hard to watch .
ye ##a i agree . people can commit some really horrific crimes . it is scary .
was the date not going well ?
i hate when that happens . was she understanding ?
that ' s great , i wish i had been that productive today . maybe i still have time for a load of laundry . good job , you .
i just haven ' t been feeling too great today . maybe your right though an easy task might make me feel better and get a head start for tomorrow .
is he okay ?
e ##w ##w ##w ##w ##w that ' s gross lo ##l
where ? why are you feeling uncertain ?
i can understand the nerves , but it will be fun !
what happened /
well , i hope you did the right thing and correct their mistake .
oh , that ' s the biggest pain . i feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet . . . they should at least be on time .
we move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets . . . the least the can do is do their work well .
i sure hope that you get it !
i believe you will get it !
that ' s right , it is supposed to come out soon , i bet you will enjoy it very much
sound like it must be killing you on waiting for the release , before you know it . you ' ll be playing it a ton
that is awesome . i bet you feel great !
and its only going to get better . the longer you go the more progress you will see . good for you .
good job . is she better now ?
that stink ##s . i hope she feels better soon !

u ##gh , i hope he ' s alright and it was nothing too ba ##b .
did he do a good job ?
thank god , bet you ' re pleased about that aren ' t you ?
oh my , are you physically okay ? it must have been very traumatic for you .
money can always come back but your health is the most important thing .
oh no , that ' s no good . did she find out ?
just have a talk with her and apologize . i ' m sure she ' ll understand . addiction is a life long battle . it ' s never too late to jump back on the wagon .
uh oh ! you should go see a doctor to get that checked out !
yeah that ' s what i would do ! good luck , friend !
what did you do ? !
lou ##sy man ! what can you do though . . . if you ' re a regular she ' ll understand when you bring her extra another time .
sounds sweet , you must be ra ##ring to go
lo ##l , the kid in you is always ready for disneyland
i agree . has something bad happened to you recently ?
yeah it really can bring you down
oh man that ##s scary ! what set it off ?
i can imagine , i wouldn ##t have been at ease either .
good luck ! i bet you ' ll get it , i have a feeling .
no problem ! is it a career oriented job ?
that is exciting , what is the test for ?
oh ok cool , are you already a police officer ?
wow , that ##s horrible ! make sure to get a police report and send it to your insurance .
i ' m sorry , try to relax and have a good weekend . know how fu ##stra ##ting that can be , hope there wasn ' t much damage .
awesome i am happy to hear that !
nice , make sure to so ##ak it up .
i never know what to do in that situation .
i bet . you never know if they are the crazy type or just down on their luck .
oh just wait . . that ' s nothing . how long were you gone for ?
it rot ##ted in 8 days ? i ' m pretty embarrassed .
oh no ! i ' ve had that happen before . not at wal ##mart but at a dentist office . did you make a dash out of there ?
yeah , i had to tell them some might be on the chair . it was crazy awful ! oh no , ha ha . sorry that happened .
are you going to miss him ?
i like to watch movies or read a good book when i feel lonely , to keep my mind busy
uh oh . what went wrong ?
that ' s too bad . did they taste okay though ?
aw , that stink ##s . what was wrong ? were you sick ?
wow ! that ' s insane ! i ' m sorry that you had that experience ! hopefully you didn ' t miss too many days of work .
heck yeah ! i love old tv shows ! what was it ?
yeah . it ' s kind of old now . was a really good show for its time until the randy days
me too . mom ##s are the bees knees .
my mom did too . your mom sounds incredible .
cong ##rat ##s ! i ' m sure you will , i love going to the gym . i mainly do card ##io .
def ##eni ##tly ! i use to run track in high school and was active duty army so running has always been a big part of my life .
awesome ! i need to have a garage sale .
i can understand that ! i don ' t like cl ##utter .
wow ! that ' s amazing . i remember when mine started . it ' s off to the races soon !
two words of advice . . . baby gates : )
aw man . i ' m sorry . how old did he turn ?
it ' ll be ok . as long as both of you guys are healthy .
i sure hope so , do you think he is a determined and intelligent person ?
nice , you must be proud of him being your brother .
that was very nice of you . i am sure that your sister appreciated that .
that is great .
nice , do you get to go the zoo any number of times you want for free ?
sounds like a dream for any animal lover ! i am guessing you must be one as well !
e ##w ##w ##w , i hope you complained so they can fix the problem ! that is def ##eni ##tly a health violation .
oh okay ! hopefully it isn ' t a constant problem , that would suck to loose your favourite rest ##ura ##nt .
i know how you feel , being young and at the beach was a fun time
you can make new memories and your kids can fond ##ly look back at them as you do to yours
aw ##w that ' s really sweet . i understand being sentimental about that sort of stuff . do you feel like you have to ?
you should just keep it for now . he may think that stuff is corn ##y now , but later in life he will be glad you kept it .
ha ##ha how dare you . lo ##l just kidding . what kind ?
o ##oo ##oo i understand why you did .
oh that ' s awful ! will insurance cover it ?
that ' s terrible . i hope you can get some compensation and feel better .
yeah , not in awhile , but i definitely know that feeling . are you having a great week ?
that ' s awesome , i hope it stays that way !
hey that ' s awesome ! where ya going ?
yeah i haven ' t either . i bet it ' s gonna be awesome . bring plenty of beer : d
filled up ? you better clean it before it over ##flow ##s !
e ##w , yeah , definitely sounds like it needs a good cleansing !
wow ##za , did you call to complain ?
phone companies are notorious for this . i hope you are able to resolve .
i have had that happen to me many times .
it is definitely a lot of work , but it is the best type of work i have ever done .
that was nice of him . what idea did you have ? as in how to return the favor or something ?
oh ##h . . . ha ##h , that makes more sense . then he did his job well . good on him . but more importantly , congratulations to you for graduating ! i know the feeling . . i ' m close to graduating myself , and i can already feel the excitement . i hope no one surprises me with a party though . . too shy of a ne ##rd for that .
that ' s kind of disgusting . i ' m glad she ' s your ex . that says much more about you than her . how did you respond to it ?
oh , that happened while you were still dating ? man . . good call . the nerve of some people , and how immature they can be . i don ' t get how that wouldn ' t make someone cr ##inge .
they probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising !
i bet it is ! and i am sure you are good enough . plus the way i see it if one door shut ##s another opens you know ? keep your head up
aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own .
i completely understand . my little baby just went off to college and although i miss him terribly , i am also proud of him .
that sounds amazing ! mom ' s food is always the best .
wow ! that sounds like an amazing visit .
oh no , what did you do ?
how did they find out ?
ha ##ha . has she found out yet ? i bet she was mad
i would be too !
that sounds like a nightmare ! hopefully no one was hurt .
did they take a lot of things ?
that will be fun . i went for my 18th birthday and it was exciting .
get the video , it is worth it !
i completely agree . it used to be about the story line and the character development .
i hope so , too . meanwhile , you can just watch old movies .
ah , couldn ' t resist ? just make up and eat well tomorrow !
yeah , you should hide them at least !
that ' s cool . what are you gonna eat there ?
oh sweet is it one of those where they cook it in front of you ?
that is nice , what happened ?
that is awesome , hopefully ya ##ll can continue your relationship
it must have been nerve wr ##ack ##ing ! did you do well ?
ha ! when in doubt , just blame it on the microphone !
oh go ##sh ! that must have been embarrassing . what happened ?
thank goodness for them ! did you not study your lines enough ? or you were just too nervous ?
ha ##ha too funny ! wow 14 ? ! su ##pr ##ised you didn ' t learn it earlier ha ##ha
i bet , that ##s a great memory ! lo ##l
i agree with you there , i do not trust those eastern bloc countries .
you made a wise choice , not only will you not get your t - shirt most likely they will steal your credit card information and use it
my husband does that all the time to ! must be a guy thing ha ##ha
wow , i hope he cleaned it up for you . i would be pissed ha ##h i take coffee very serious .
that ' s a loaded statement . . can you un ##pack that for me ? what are you so excited about that ' s coming up ?
oh , right on . do you guys not have school starting already though ? maybe you guys have kids that aren ' t school - aged . anyway , i ' ve only been a couple of times , to go to disney world . is that where you guys are going ? if so , i hope you have a good time !
ha ##ha ##ha ##ha that ' s so funny . did you get it out of the house ?
dan ##g that ' s creative ! !
rainy days are perfect for being lazy .
that sounds relaxing .
oh my , it must have been scary for you being in an unknown area ,
what a good sam ##ari ##tan ! be careful next time and carry a phone with you just in case .
what car is it ?
those are nice cars , but keep working , it will come in due time
i agree , looks like a great game to play with friends ! when is it coming out ?
that is actually not far ! i can see what i am going to be doing over the holidays !
that ' s awesome , that ##s a kind of woman every man needs in their life .
i ' m happy for you , i ' m sure she feels the same about you !
what new job did you get ?
that is great news , hopefully it goes well .
oh yeah , what makes you say that ?
what an incredible stroke of luck ! i hope he lets you check it out , really get your hands on it !
what ' d they say exactly ?
what kind of hairs ##tyle was it ?
that must make you feel good . any favorites ?
ah yes that is a good one . where you close with them ?
i have never gone . was it really that much fun going with an ex though ?
maybe i will check it out . i have heard good things about bran ##son
why is that ?
that is good then , i hope they can fix it for you ! !
that is really sweet . it sounds like you really love her .
it seems like you know what to do to make it work .
oh no , i ' m sorry that sounds awful disappointing . if it ' s any consolation i think it ' s easier to diet than to work out . the old phrase " can ' t out ##run the fork . "
i ' m sorry . what has really helped my friend has been not keeping any snacks in the house and cutting out most bread . he really struggles with bread and sugar though .
that sounds cool , they are a great vehicle
you shouldn ' t be , it just a material object that has no lasting meaning
oh im so sorry ! it hurts when our parents leave us . my uncle , who was basically my father , died in april .
it ' s ok to feel however you are feeling . it ' s normal . you never get over it , but you do learn to live with it .
that ' s awful . are you going to complain to the restaurant ?
what kind of topping ##s did you order ?
why does baseball remind you of him ?
those must be great memories .
that must of been no fun .
prepare to spend hours on it , the directions are always bad .
yu ##m ! i had pizza as well tonight , although i didn ' t make it .
yes i did , i need to learn how to cook one by myself !
u ##gh , do you know how it got there ?
oh my goodness ! do you think an intruder got in and used your house as a wash ##room for his dog ?
i ' m sure you will do fine ! just be confident , what is the job /
oh wow that sounds exciting ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great , just express that passion !
ha ##ha i am sorry to laugh . is it an expensive window to fix .
damn , i am sorry that happen ##ened . . did you talk to the paper boy ?
sorry to hear that . have you tried encouraging them to play together ?
oh no , is he territorial ? he will warm up eventually when he realizes the cat is a family member .
oh i am so sorry . it ' s ok , it probably wasn ' t the che ##eto ##s that got him - rodents just don ' t have a long lifespan . i hope you feel better .
rest in power bubbles . you were , i ' m sure , a ham ##ster among ham ##sters .
do you think you can impress them ?
i believe in you , just project yourself confidently !
it definitely can be , just learn to drive defensive ##ly !
you will learn with experience and i ' m sure you will be a great driver !
are you prepared ? do you have all the ingredients ?
nice . i am sure it will taste great then .
did it bring back good memories ?
sometimes it ' s fun to look back .
i can understand your frustration .
i am sure you can find a friend to help out .
did you call your card company ?
i don ##t blame you . that is a very annoying thing to have to deal with
do little kids dressed as witches and ghosts fright ##en you ?
that ' s understand ##able . i ' ve always been too scared to go to a haunted house . i get sp ##ook ##ed easily .
that is a very nice thing for him to do . where did he pick you up ?
wow were you ok ? lucky you didn ' t have to go to the hospital !
why did you give him access to your home though ?
that makes sense , you guys going to hang ##out soon ?
im terrified of roller ##co ##aster ##s
i agree , i just get on and close my eyes
oh my , i hope you weren ' t embarrassed about it , if it was a good trip ?
nice ! i would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldn ' t like it if i did !
did it help you re ##wind the old times ?
i agree , that ##s why i always keep my old year books around when i feel like i need a break from the present .
oh no ! that ' s exciting and terrifying . do you think it will work out ?
in that case i ' d say you very well deserve it ! i hope you get it .
how so ?
ah ye ##a now everyone is stuck staring at there phones .
yeah , flying is the worst .
you can also have some drinks too !
oh you left some out then ? were they worse ones ?
ah i am also guilty of that one . i believe we all are in some ways .
how come , what are you doing wrong at work ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , you must be so let down .
that i ##g good to hear ! how long have you been together ?
aw ##w that ' s a significant amount of time .
oh no , what happened ?
i hope your dog makes a full recovery !
how exciting ! do you feel like you are ready ?
it is great to be confident . i am sure you will knock the interview out of the park !
hey that ' s awesome ! any plans this weekend ?
yeah that ' s good that you ' re keeping a level head about it . and realize that anything can happen at a moments notice . i tend to appreciate what i have in my life as well .
oh no that sounds terrible . hopefully it ' s not as bad as some of those stories i have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree .
oh my go ##sh that sounds so awful . i ' m sorry . maybe you can try getting him into rehab , i hear it ' s hard for someone to stop once they start .
your mom must be a strong woman .
that sounds so tr ##ou ##bling . you should get on your brother ' s case .
what a bum ##mer . did you have any sort of coverage for it ? and how did you do it accidentally ?
hopefully you can get through the rough patch in the interim .
yeah well you only have so much time to work with . time management is one of the most important skills you can learn .
the most important thing is to realize you need improvement . some people like to blame everything else but them ##sel ##f !
maybe you unconscious ##ly wanted to wear it . maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you ? what if you went and did it again the next day , to see if you liked it ?
it ' s time to go online and buy some summer dresses for yourself . explore your fe ##mini ##nity , man . it ' s 2018 . anything goes . bruce / cai ##tly ##n jen ##ner , etc . summer isn ' t over . put those hairy legs on display and st ##rut your stuff in those dresses . get flower ##y ones , too !
who ##op who ##op ! that ' s awesome ! i hope you get the job .
no problem ! is this a career like job ?
what show is it ?
what band is it ?
yeah , it ' s weird going back to college .
oh yeah , bad influences . when i look at my student loan payments , i don ' t miss college .
okay , so i never understood why people ate it . what is it about it that makes them want to do that ? i just flicked mine . and i thought it stopped at a child ' s age . really interesting .
i ' ve heard of oral fix ##ations before , but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes , etc . but i guess if i think about it , a lot of people chew fingernails , and i ' m sure that ' s just as bad bacteria - wise . maybe the boo ##ger eater ##s are on to something .
that must have been unbearable . did you complain to the staff about the smell ?
good , i would avoid that airline too .
that is a terrible feeling . i saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home . that would be the worst .
well i hope everything turned out ok . maybe you can send a friend to check your door .
avatar the air ##ben ##der or james cameroon ##s avatar ?
ah yes it has been a long time since that movie came out ! it has some of the best c ##gi ever .
they just didn ##t play like a team and its no surprise that happened .
i hope so , they shouldn ##t be getting beat like that .
who was it ?
uh i would have called the police , did they have a re ##ao ##n ?
i wish i could relate , but i ' ve never had to go to court . i hope it goes smoothly for you . all i ' ve ever heard is to dress appropriately and to speak as respectful ##ly as you can as possible .
i hope for your sake that you don ' t have to , either . but this doesn ' t have to define you . how you respond can , though . if you ' re mentally tough , it will be a bump in the road . i guess do whatever you can to maintain healthy focus .
ha ##ha good timing by your roommate . does he not knock ?
ha ##ha ##ha ##a that ' s funny . i am sure you can install a lick pretty easily if the door is wooden .
i bet it brings back lots of great memories .
i do ni ##t think i have heard of that game . was it pretty popular ?
how does that make you feel ?
i am sorry , i am sure he is just being nice for the sake of not getting in trouble !
that is always a drag . i hope it is routine and nothing serious .
oh yeah i know what you mean about hospitals . they are always so busy and you see lots of sick people .
i totally know what you mean .
you also need some good pickup lines .
did she ever em ##bara ##ss you out in public ?
yi ##kes , i hope they did not take that to heart too much . . .
my girls seem to like the pokemon go game - is this a new one ?
tell me more about it - maybe it will be something my girls will like also .
wow ! what was the dog doing or what was the show about ?
nice , i love watching cute dogs doing cool things !
that is crazy , how did they get separated ?
oh wow , best of luck with that !
i am sure you deserve it for all the hard work you do . i will send in my recommendation .
sure , i wish there were more employees like you with such a strong work et ##hic .
how much money did you make with it ? i assume most people would have sold before the peak out of fear of it crashing
holy cow , cong ##rat ##ual ##tions , that sure is smart of you !
well still , it takes bravery !
interesting . . . lo ##l
i can ' t believe i made this much money with bit ##co ##in .
i am so sorry . i just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimer ' s . i wish there was some way i could help you , it is such a tough road .
you are completely fine needing some time . there is nothing fair about something that takes your best friend and turns them into a stranger . be there with her , but you have to take time to rec ##har ##ge yourself . no one can be strong all the time .
that game was su ##pr ##ising . the browns of all teams lo ##l
ye ##a true and they used their back ups mo ##ost ##ly . f ##oles is having a rough start .
what coaster did you ride ?
i have never heard of that , is it twist ##y or a big drop ?
i just got done traveling myself ! there ' s no better feeling than the anticipating of traveling . i love airports , especially , because of all the people - watching and the general atmosphere . i hope your trip goes smoothly !
oh , got ##cha . my mix - up . driving and road trips can still be just as fun . kinda stink ##s if you ' re the only one driving , but at least you can come up with games to play . plus . . it ' s cheaper . that ' s always nice .
oh man i bet summer went by quick for you then . did you have fun together ?
yeah . that sucks you guys are apart now : ( i ' d love to do a mountain trip like that though .
it ' ll be ok : ) how long does this busy ##ness usually last for ?
oh that ' s not too ##o bad . . . can you take your vacation during that time ?
why did you move ?
oh , well it will come !
some people have better cards then we do in life . it ' s how you play your cards though .
humans can ' t help that . but its what makes us strive to be better !
why did you get a cat ?
they are , i hope yours behave ##s better in time
why did you do that ?
that is terrible , i hope things get better for you both
he should be recovered by the early part of the season .
yeah , the f ##oles injury is more worrying .
it ' s hard for me to em ##path ##ize since i ' m just in college right now . but my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way , and i hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work . i try to give her her space and to be understanding . hopefully people do that with you , too .
well , if there ' s any way you can give them insight to what you ' re dealing with , so that they better understand , i would do it . my girlfriend spent 10 min ##s one day explaining to me what she dealt with , and it went a long way for me to not bother her as much about it
i get that , i have had jobs like that , some people just thrive on drama , they do not enjoy anything more than that
i understand that , that is a great move by you , do not get sucked in
eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself .
he doesn ' t sound too reasonable if you ask me .
i hate saying ##s , but the one that goes , " tough times don ' t last , but tough people do , " really applies . life is long . you have plenty of time to change your fortune , and you seem self aware enough to do it . i hope you can work your way back up .
of course , but it doesn ' t really matter what i say , or what i think . you already knew all that stuff anyway . everyone has to have confidence in themselves . someone else ' s confidence makes no difference . but as long as you ' re alive , you ' ve got a chance .
why is it a great day ?
what type of dog is it ?
wow , that is so cute , i hope he gets trained quickly !
how did you break the tv ?
did your parents get mad at you ?
wow , i can ' t even imagine . what caused the fire ?
were you home when it started ?
did you study for it ?
great then ! you can ace any " hard " test as long as you put in the work and time ! i hope you did well .
me too ! what is your favorite part ?
i agree with you . i cannot wait . it is such a fun time
cool ! what are you all gonna do ?
that ' s awesome ! ! i hope you have fun and be safe !
i know right , some printers are just terrible .
i can feel your frustration .
oh wow , i love thunder ##storm ##s . . . . though i know they make some people really uncomfortable .
it ' s always good to be nice and prepared for anything . better safe than sorry they always say . good for you .
wow . . . are you ok ?
oh ha ##ha when you say pit bull i immediately think it could be a violent occurrence . i ' m glad you are ok : )
i hope it works out for you !
be a gentleman and you will be golden .
yi ##kes ! did you find out who it was ?
man that ' s awful . did you file a police report ?
i bet you found some cool stuff
oh wow ! those were fun . did you play it ?
i love lego ##s ! they have gotten expensive though .
yeah , thinking about old toys makes me somewhat sad .
wow ! all by himself in one sitting ? ?
are you hoping to do the same thing ? ? ? !
ha ##ha . which one were you root ##ing for ?
were you disappointed that they lost ?
oh that ' s quite luck and fortunate for you , i ' ve never had a lost wallet returned .
i don ' t blame you .
yu ##ck ! i hate when friends do that !
yeah i don ' t blame you . time to find some new friends !
are you nervous ?
oh that ' s a standard prc ##ed ##ure . have you ever had one ?
everything will be fine : )
did you ease your nerves ?
i ' m glad everything worked out for you !
sometimes solitude can be a good thing . were you hoping for company ?
call me next time and i will go with you .
have you been contacted by the irs ?
well id say no news is good news
aw ##w ##w ##w , that ' s so sad . was he lost ?
good job ! there need to be more people like you in this world .
american football or soccer ?
yeah i bet . are you a browns fan or something ?
that sounds like a bum ##mer , what brand ?
too bad you don ' t have a pond you can throw it into .
she ##es ! some people just don ##t understand some things others just don ##t care to talk about
it happens everywhere . some poe ##ple are just too dense to realize .
wow ##za . . . how did it go ?
oh go ##sh . . . . that is embarrassing . were you able to recover ? lo ##l
what happened ?
it ' s smart to play it safe . sometimes we are unable to predict what other humans are capable of .
you seem very smart ; 0
what a loyal dog ! they are such good creatures . we humans don ' t deserve them .
i ' m glad he was there to protect you ! hopefully it doesn ' t happen again because that ' s very scary .
did you take it back ?
dan ##g . did you eat it or throw it away ?
no , tell me about it !
yeah , egg ##pl ##ant is pretty gross .
i ' m so sorry to hear that . it will get better , though .
going to the gym or taking up a hobby can make you feel more confident and motivated .
oh no ! i am so sorry . was he old ?
wow ! sounds like he had a full life . you are a good pet owner . : )
hey cong ##rat ##s ! ! ! how ##s being a parent working
yeah i ' ve always heard that about kidd ##os . cong ##rat ##s and good luck ! i ' m sure you will be an awesome parent ! ! : d
you ' re welcome . i think i hear a baby crying . you better go check on that : d
that must be such a relief !
in a way , it is actually just the beginning .
they didn ' t even eat it ! how dare they ! !
did you find out who did it ?
oh , what car was it ? are you jealous ?
that is a sweet ride !
that ##s good ! how old is he ?
congratulations ! parenting done right !
ha ##ha . where they mad ? and how did you react ?
yeah i bet . i would be too . how em ##bara ##ssing
oh no ! how so ?
ha ##ha i agree . hopefully you can make it through it without too much anxiety .
wow that ' s always a good news ! i do love my pizza , and i am guessing you do too !
oh god ! make sure you post a lot of pictures and give updates on the taste ! you must be so excited
nice ! he must be pretty good .
nice . you must be pretty happy for him . will you go to his games ?
what job are you starting ?
do you get a big raise too ?
you know something worker _ 1 , every ##time you feel good about something , it always means that you did good ! take for example myself , when i had my job interview i also felt really good about it and guess what ? i got the job !
that ' s good news indeed ! i wish you the best and make sure you work hard !
you certainly are lucky to have a dad , me too !
i wish everyone was that lucky .
how much did you end up saving ?
that ' s amazing , who did you switch too ?
oh , wow . are you happy for him ?
yeah , we all get jealous sometimes .
you are a good friend ! are you nervous ?
nice . i wish i had more friends like you .
congratulations ! what will be his name ?

you should be more confident in your abilities ! i am sure you ' ll make an amazing bean dip

oh really ? what movie ?
that sounds so fun ! love murder and comedy , sounds like you ' re going to have a blast
yeah ? nothing interesting happen ##d whatsoever ? why not make it exciting yourself ?
damn , any plans for next week ?
buying newspaper ? 21st century ? sold out ? what ##t that ' s a first for me , here they practically give it away for free and we still have many more left , maybe you can use your phone or tablet to view it ?
oh man , don ' t worry if you google free coup ##oin ##s there are bunch ! that ' s what i do
ah the good ol high hopes go watch a movie come out disappointed , i totally get ya man , what movie ?
oh yes ! the meg , my colleague from work was di ##sa ##point ##ed beyond repair , he was telling us all not to watch it , i guess in a sense i am lucky
i think that ' s a wonderful attitude to have !
i hope they are as well . i do love some fishing .
oh my , what did you see ? a mess i pre ##sume ?
oh no that is definitely something you don ' t want to be surprised by .
what happen ##d ? tell me
that ' s sad news , i am sorry for this news you must have been extra drained after coming back from work from that news
i ' m sorry , who was stefan ?
oh okay , now i know . yeah that was tragic .
yi ##kes that pretty bad
ye ##a i know what you mean
oh no that is horrible ! did you call the police ?
that ' s good . i ' m sorry that terrible thing happened to you .
oh man . i don ##t like the dentist . is it a normal cleaning and check up or something more ?
i would be too !
well , that sounds good , hopefully there won ' t be a lot of pain .
it ' ll be fine . don ' t worry .
why did you do that ? wasn ' t there a toilet or something ?
that must ' ve been embarrassing . you should ' ve went to the toilet .
oh what went wrong ?
that ##s a fuck ##in bum ##mer , hope you left her
it ' s always great to have friends that are willing to help out when you need them the most .
when are you expecting to move ?
that ##s sounds ho ##rri ##fying
hopefully nothing too bad happened
ah that sucks . did they have a good reason to do so ?
yes i would be too . i ' d let my friend know that i don ' t appreciate being treated that way .
were you able to replace it before he found out ?
i think that would be the best option . nothing worse to be thirsty and have your taste buds set on something and it ' s not there .
ah yes , do other members cause some trouble for you ?
that is indeed frustrating . a little appreciation and recognition is what they need to give you i think .
why did you have to send it back ? what happen ##d
good thing you returned it ! rare or whatever they call it meat is actually very dangerous for you es ##pc ##ial ##ly coming from a restaurant good thing you did that !
not cool ! i love monsters ! i hate when my girlfriend takes the last one
that is good to hear !
what ' s that ?
what kind is it ? i have a bad one too by the way .
are you going to be on the news when you win ? ?
yeah ! when you win i get first crack at your auto ##graph !
that ##s nice to hear
oh really ? i just had some myself today , love su ##shi
that sounds like it was a gross situation . i bet it has hard to clean .
it can always happen with pets and it is a drag to clean , i know . my dog has done it more than once .
how did you do on your test ? did you find out ?
what course did you test for ?
that ##s awesome good for you
im glad that ##s the case
oh god that ' s annoying , the same thing ha ##pp ##ned to me for my iphone case , they got me the smaller one isn ##tead of the normal big size one , so annoyed
a ##y ##y ##y that ' s a win isn ' t it ? but still annoying but at least you getting it for free now
sounds like your ##e going on vacation !
where are you going ? i haven ' t taken a vacation in a long time
grandma ' s food always brings back memories , for some reasons they taste very nos ##tal ##gic .
it was so simple back then right ? not having to worry about anything but enjoying life .
oh really ? that ' s very coincide ##ntal because my son also started football this year are you happy ?
i know ! they grow so fast and i didn ' t think i ' d use that overly used word but god it ' s so true
oh that ' s awful ! maybe you can try to return it and say it came like that lo ##l
it ' s a little funny
that ' s great ! it feels good when you can get a little back from the things you have invested so much in !
definitely ! plus , gets some of the cl ##utter out of your home , i guess to make room for more .
what was the shock ?
oh my god ! that ' s so bad what did you do ?
why ? what is going on ?
sounds like you need a vacation
what makes you think so ? i ' m pretty sure you aren ' t .
that doesn ' t make you a failure ! you are doing more than enough and i ' m pretty sure she appreciate every single thing you ' re doing for her .
oh wow ! cong ##rat ##s ! ! what are you hoping for ?
that is so awesome ! how old are they ?
its always good to get away and reset
did you make a check list and double check it ?
i ' m sorry ? what happened ?
that ' s awful . i hate when that happens .
really ? like how ? what she do ?
don ' t worry , with people like this karma hits them very very hard , and they get what they deserve
were you driving or walking ?
i hope they caught the person who almost hit you . that kind of incident can leave you trauma ##tized for a long time .
o ##of that ##s not a fun si ##utation
that ##s a vivid description ha ##ha
that ' s nice , wanna share this wonderful experience with me ?
wow ! that is such a wonderful thing to do indeed ! i am proud of you
that ' s amazing ! i do not ( so far ) but i hope to some day .
thanks ! i appreciate it . i am really happy for you though ! that ' s one of the best things to feel in life i am sure .
oh wow , that must have been scary ! i ' m terrified of snakes !
the only time i ' ve seen one up close is when a professional was handling one . i prefer to keep a distance .
did you call the police ? or did you do what needed to be done ?
well , glad it wasn ' t something important . it was just a cat . and you are safe . so that is great !
what if what ? what has you so fearful ?
maybe a career in astro - physics is in your future ?
wow ! that ' s amazing what did she do ?
oh god yes , they grow so fast next thing you know she ' s taking care of you and you are all old ha ##ha it ' s so wonderful
that ' s great ! is there a particular reason , or just in general ?
that ' s so great ! cong ##rat ##s !
any particular reason that made you do that ?
right , well we can all get that way sometimes . i ' d just tell your friend directly that you weren ' t feeling up to it .
that ##s really nice
su ##shi is the best
is there no way to get in touch with anyone ?
why are you alone in a room ? do you need me to come over ?
really ? why is that ?
wow ! that is next level smart ##ness and thinking ! good job
i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too ! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee
it ' s probably the best feeling on earth right ?
that ##s super cool
that ##s impressive good luck to her
i can ' t wait either , i am looking forward to it as well . do you know when the release date is ?
cod 4 comes out in about two weeks i think .
i agree . everyone seems to be out for them ##sel ##f and do not care to help other or take others into consideration
yeah its a tough ##t thing to have to deal with
oh god ! how much did he rip you off by ?
oh , so what are you going to do about this ?
this happens a lot at work , maybe try to talk to them about it ?
i agree everyone is just self - centered and it ' s very annoying to communicate with those people .
how do you feel about it ? ready ?
just do your best you can , and that way you won ' t have any regrets no matter what the result is .
oh that ##s cool
ye ##a i know that feel its the same for me right now
you must really trust them . i hope it turned out well .
now you know who to call when you want to go away again .
oh yeah my brother would always get some things i wanted too . made me feel jealous .
that ' s even worse . well i hope you at least got to ride it when she wasn ' t looking !
oh wow that sounds nice
i just did last week actually
oh no ! why didn ' t you do anything about it ?
s ##ni ##tch ? is that actually still a thing ?
oh wow ! what was the discovery ?
mind . blown . that sounds breath taking
oh god ! that must have been so scary
oh god ! just hand them what they want , it ' s not worth your life
wow that ##s very faithful of you
not really but i can respect it
aw ##w ##w that ' s so sweet of them , are you guys close ?
that ' s so nice , are you looking forward to un ##i ?
yep almost everyday because of my fiancee . what about you ?
i know , there ' s nothing like true love .
as in a grade ?
that can happen sometimes even when you are prepared . it ' s like test anxiety . has it happened before ?
how did you end up doing ?
how well ? i ' m proud of you for that my man .
what ? what did you do /
that ' s so nice ! good thing you do , we need more people like you , all these norm ##ies nowadays just sleeping around and only chasing after can ##ni ##bal ##istic desires
what happened !
you must be upset , are you okay do you need any help ?
oh did it go well ?
huh sounds quite intimate
are you nervous of meeting new friends ?
i think you should look to join a club in school !
yes ! i live about 30 min ##s away from the coast . i love going at night
yes , i love when the water is flat and its just a glass ##y reflection . i also love when the water is rough and lou ##g
aw ##w that ' s so nice ! did you have the biggest smile on your face /
that makes me so happy ! you blessed my day ! i can ' t wait to see my son do that too
why was he beating you ?
oh what an abusive person , how did yo us ##top him ?
i ' m sorry to hear that , can you make it up to them ?
you should try to reach out to them .
i hope it wasn ' t an important and you still managed to pass everything . why did that happen ?
don ' t worry about it , maybe it was the teacher ' s fault . but since you ' re okay and everything is fine there ' s no point in worrying about it .
tell me what has you so worked up ?
i am so sorry . i know right now your mind is spinning and everything is chaotic . you need to sit somewhere and let your mind settle down .
that ' s a good idea , what do you need to buy ?
that ' s smart , i love a big turkey dinner the family will be pleased i bet .
what did you decide to do instead ?
that ' s lucky of you , do you plan on being a pharmacy tech ?
what else would you do if you didn ##t go ?
that sounds like good money
did you try going to any clubs to meet anyone ?
you should consider trying to network though it ' s worth it .
why is that ?
that ##s nice of you
why does it creep you out ? i think it ' s pretty good
you could always try su ##shi bowls .
why is that ? what happen ##d ?
it ' s okay ! if you really want to do it you will do it strength isn ' t all physical your real strength is the will to do ! if you have that , the 15 push ups can be turned to 100 !
just once . if the car had not died i would have hit a building .
i know that feeling for sure . i freaked out because i could not remember how to use the brake .
did you make it home in time ?
that is so lame , what caused you to be so late ? just the lights ?
aw ##w ##w , that ' s so sweet i as ##pire to be like you with my fiance , i will soo ##on get married ! what re you guys planning to do ? and what ' s your guys secret for holding a relationship for so long ?
i know she is the one , we are identical in every way , i am the only person who understands her and she is the only one who understands me , we communicate about everything and we are both non norm ##ies !
what did he won ? were you hoping for some help ?
it ' s insane how people can be so selfish once they see money , ee ##n your own father becomes a monster . don ' t let it bother you .
yi ##kes ! that ' s a load to clean isn ' t it ?
i know ! my cats are a hell to take care of as well , one always po ##ops in the kitchen while the other one chases off my pigeons , it ' s really annoying
what letter ? please share this experience with me
oh wow ! that is such good news ! i am so happy for you , what are you going to study there ?
wow that ' s so mo ##tiv ##ating to hear , what inspire ##s you to become a police officer
yeah , i hope you be one of the good cops , not like the current ones
did you just move back ?
i miss waking up to my mom ##s big breakfast ##s . i actually live a block away from her
what kind of restaurant was it ?
i do love a good burr ##ito , i should go check it out some time .
go on ! tell me about it , let ' s hear it
what ended up happening ?
that ' s so disgusting you are disgusting
how long did you have your dog for ? that must ' ve been very painful , losing a pet is always hard
that ' s a lot of time . you could say he was part of your family .
with those kind of people you just have to be blunt . if that doesn ' t work then it ' s time to excuse yourself from the conversation .
you are usually left with no other option .
were they good memories ?
yes i love that feeling
oh , i " m sorry to hear that ! i know how hard that can be to lose a loved pet .
well , i hope you feel better soon !
how exciting ! what is he planning on doing next ?
that ' s impressive , is he hoping to play professionally ?
fun jobs with good pay do exist
that does make sense
oh , it ' s crazy what some people will try . but , sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch !
i don ' t really blame the driver . plus , that ' s annoying delay in everybody ' s busy day .
i understand ! i felt the same when my son left , it ' s seems so much less noise and talk .
i understand ! i felt the same when my son left , it ' s seems so much less noise and talk .
a good friend is hard to find .
do you have a best friend ?
how long have you been friends ?
yeah but we aren ' t as close as we used to be .
yes . this situation happened every friends relation . due to this we are in relation with a family members
don ' t worry all the friends are came to you be happy
yes , one friend
2 years later i spoke to him
that could def be an improve ##m ##nt . what kind did you have in mind
good choices . which are you leaning towards ?
was it a su ##pr ##ise ?
where is he living now ? have you heard from him at least ?
i really do hate that stuff
its a sick sad world
i know you have really been looking forward to this . where did you decide on going ?
my niece went there and loved it . are you flying in or taking a cruise ?
were you able to return it ?
does it fit . id just have them send me a new one when it comes back in stock . its their mistake .
did he go home with you ?
boo . poor pup ##per
oh , no ! well , it happens sometimes , we get so busy and don ' t notice .
life gets us out of w ##ha ##ck , don ' t feel bad . i ' m sure you can pay for it next time .
that ' s fantastic ! it certainly is a great feeling , financial freedom !
that ' s so great !
left until what ?
that sounds like a lot of fun
what was sketch ##y about it ?
yi ##kes . did you end up placing the order ?
what was it it ?
you can ##t be serious .
you definitely made my day .
well good luck with whatever is out there .
are you currently saving up ?
i bet . how far south of the continent are you ?
cool . i have a friend that lives in brazil
that ##s awesome ! ! tell ga ##bi i said hi when you go : d
that ' s a good thing . lying to the police opens a whole world of trouble .
especially if it involves going to jail .
how did you cut your hand ?
did you lose any fingers ?
did you get hurt doing the robbery ?
how long ago did this occur ?
are you going because someone else wants to or was it something that you wanted to do ?
if you don ' t have any choice then i suggest you bring ear ##pl ##ug ##s .
oh no did people look at you judging ##ly ?
well you can learn from it , and be better for it .
who ##w ! that is one mean car ! what did your friend say ?
that must be quite exciting to drive around in those super ##cars !
that is great . what are you studying ?
good luck
what ##s the distance ?
how does one prepare for a marathon ? by running ?
what kind of feelings ?
more than anything ? ! more than cats ? ? you must really love her !
i hope you didn ' t listen to them .
nice , you must do whatever you want each day .
hopefully all of your hard work will pay off and you will do well .
all you can do is do your best and whatever happens after that at least you will know that you gave it your all .
i understand . did you finally took them skating ?
i understand . those things happened .
did you run into any problems ?
that ' s a lot of questions . how did the rest of the trip turn out ?
is it your first time there ?
i do love a good beach , i was just in the philippines and they have some of the best beaches iv ##e ever seen .
that was nice of you . is she still alive ?
sorry about her death . at least you enjoyed your time with her .
how that happened ?
maybe your cat started a family somewhere in nature )
do you know who stole it ?
maybe it will turn up , who knows .
are you playing ?
i understand . what is the name of your team ?
what kind of car is it ?
that is one awesome car ! don ' t be too jealous ! just start saving your money !
wow . that sounds exciting . you should do fine .
what kind of motorcycle did you buy ?
about to , what happened ?
is your name kim by any chance ?
uh ##oh . i ' m assuming it was not safely returned to you ?
fanny packs for the win !
yes but that is how it goes sometimes .
all you can do it work hard and try to make more money .
that is great . are you working ?
is it a little bit complicated to have two jobs ?
you are wonderful just the way you are ! be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful ! i am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too .
it is all in your head . what makes you think being tall is any fun ##ner ? : )
i hope you had insurance .
sure , it must be a real pain to be in your imaginary shoes .
oh i hope nothing bad came from that ?
yeah that can be stress ##ful .
that ' s really hard to do . i should do the same thing , but i still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day . it could help though .
i can imagine . that is really great that you are able to follow his advice and maybe each day will get a little bit better . anxiety is the worst !
good luck . what class ?
what ##s your major ?
sometime you got to pay for quality .
hopefully you can save up and get a pair .
i hope you did . is it one that you really wanted ?
patience paid off for you then hopefully .
i am sorry to hear that . i am sure you be fine .
we all go through tough times . it will work out for you in the end .
wow , what a thrilling sport . yeah , i sure hope he knows what he ' s doing . you life depends on it !
you are certainly brave my friend . i don ' t have the guts to ever do that ! be safe !
why can ' t you play ? that must be very disappointing .
ou ##ch ! i ' m so sorry . how long until you can play again ?
ha ##ha , why did you go on ? peer pressure ?
that makes sense ! i bet it didn ' t go as bad as you think !
is that good or bad ?
maybe you should child proof the house .
i know . those were the days .
i liked going to blockbuster picking out movies .
that sucks , did the house get any damage ?
that is good , at least you were prepared .
that ' s great , hope you get it ! but , seems you have much on your plate already .
oh , i see , well that sounds better for sure . good luck , and i hope you will get it .
oh , no . do you have a plan b ?
think of it this way . if you had waited , you wouldn ' t have been able to get the house . dig in and fight too keep it .
that is no good ! why have you been feeling so sad and depressed ?
wow ! that does sound like a lot of mis ##fort ##une ! just try your best to think positive if you can . you never know what the future has in store for you !
that must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari . was it fun ?
i bet . what color ferrari do you have ? be careful not to drive to fast now
oh no ! he doesn ' t seem like such a good friend then . i hate it when friends pull stuff like that !
that sucks ! he definitely appears he was trying to avoid you . well one day he will need something and you can give him a taste of his own medicine . lo ##l
that is terrible . did you call the police ?
i understand . i hate when that happened .
that is so scary . did he destroy anything ?
i would have been too . was there more than one ?
most people do not possess those qualities these days . that is quite honorable of you . being faithful is quite important !
you should be . i am sure your family appreciate ##s it as well !
i understand , my parents are 85 and 88 , both with dementia .
i ' m glad it ' s that way for you . my parents destroyed my life intentionally years ago .
nice ! sounds like you will be successful then ! i think you will do great !
ha ##ha ##ha , ne ##rds are cool these days , haven ' t you heard ? sounds like you are on the road to success !
that must be very difficult to have to wait for results . i hope they come back and everything is fine though .
yes , that is not fun at all . i ' ve been there and it ' s hard not to think about anything else . i really wish you the very best
that ' s so great ! you seem quite content .
that ' s so cool . i think i would feel the same way , except i was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt ! lo ##l
that ' s interesting . why on earth would she want it back ?
that is crazy ! there has to be an explain ##ation !
i ' m in that boat right now too . i feel it ' s going to be a long time coming .
i hope you can hang on for something better .
i don ##t have any kids . i want to adopt one day .
im happy for you .
yeah , it was fun . . . and so free .
i lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool , so i loved swimming .
there is nothing better than being content .
that makes you feel safe .
oh yi ##kes ! that is a scary thing to witness . it is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking . it is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment .
yes , be safe my friend ! i am sure you will because of your hands on experience with what you saw .
that ' s not good ! have you considered going to rehab ?
maybe a different facility could help ? addiction isn ' t something you can deal with by yourself .
what did you ? did you return to the store ?
i understand .
did you have any money bet on it ?
well , then it wasn ' t too bad .
not quite sure i get what your ##e saying . lost as in missing ?
wow . sorry to hear . i don ##t know too much about dementia .
oh , it happens to the best of us . i have done the same a ga ##zi ##lli ##on times ! it doesn ' t get any better or fun ##nier , lo ##l .
oh well , just know that everybody in the world has fallen a few times . the most important thing is you just get up and keeping walking . : )
was it a large one ?
i ' m happy for you .
that is great . is it a big one ?
wow . it is a great raise . your employer should have impressed by you .
oh , wow , that is absolutely terrible ! i can imagine it was ho ##rri ##fying for you .
was he dead , or just injured badly ? i wouldn ' t be sure what to really do either .
uh oh ! that is not a good sign ! do you think they are going to call it quit ##s ?
it is good to have these kinds of keep sake ##s . maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding .
that sounds like it is going to be a super trip , you ' ll have a blast
boston is a great place to visit , makes sure you have some chow ##dah : )
yes , death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents . but that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life . it is just the nature of life .
oh , what a bad pain to carry . i hope that you are happy though . your parents will want you to always stay happy . they are in a better place now .
oh , how cute ! i love animals , especially pup ##pies !
oh , yu ##ck ! they will do that , but sure don ' t want puppy kisses later .
that ' s good . i know it ' s very expensive to replace that part , so i ' m sure you are relieved .
yes , for sure ! i always prefer repairs over replacement if possible .
that would make me nervous ! you never know what kind of person it could be , a predator perhaps .
true !
that is always a great feeling ! i love gardening ! what did you plant ?

i am sorry to hear about all the lay ##offs . i will pray for you at church for you to keep your job . what do you do for work ?
how long have you been an accountant ?
the weather is terrible here also . i hate that . are you on the east side of america ?
that is bad . what are you planning to do the rest of the day ?
oh that is a tough period . poor baby ! but with ma ##mma ##s love everything is alright . you are such a great mother !
yeah , hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teeth ##ing . hopefully is is natural .
oh no ! that ' s terrible . what made you choose that stock , and what will you do now ?
you ' ll earn it all back , don ' t worry . for next time , though , don ' t listen to people who know nothing .
that ' s great ! did you win your fight .
cong ##rat ##s ! you trained for it so you deserved to win !
that ' s great ! i love soccer . i grew up in scotland , where everyone ' s golf and soccer crazy . how old is your son ?
i bet that makes you so proud . perhaps he ' ll become a professional soccer player one day !
oh no ! ! i hope it wasn ' t coffee ! yes that is pretty embarrassing . people probably thought you pee ##d your pants .
oh , well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it won ' t happen again .
oh yeah . was the food good ? what about the service ?
oh my go ##sh ! what where they serving ? that makes me feel sick for you . i hate being dec ##ie ##ved !
i hate aggressive drivers . they cause the majority of the accidents .
he probably had no where to go important . he was just being rude .
that sounds like fun . what were you taking pictures of ? i didn ' t know film existed anymore lo ##l
do you take pictures professionally or just a hobby ?
first im sorry for your heartbreak , but second . . . its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass . how long has it been ?
sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it . maybe fitness ?
that is great . what is it a big amount that you had to pay back ?
i hate having debts .
awe , that is a very good friend to have . you are very lucky to have a friend like that . hopefully you are there for him too . : )
count your lucky stars my friend ! bless you heart !
that ' s great . it really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals .
i hope you do as well , that will be a big step towards a great career .
that was nice of you . i hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself .
that is very kind of you . there needs to be more people like you in the world !
and did he pull through ?
i love it w ##her ##n
did you all have a good time there ?
ha ##ha ! roller ##co ##aster ##s are an ex ##hila ##rating experience ! i love riding them at amusement parks .
oh my . . . you have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments .
i know someone else that happened to . i wouldn ' t take anymore chances either .
weekends are beautiful if you don ' t work on them and have nothing to do !
enjoy the weekend as much as you can for me ; i work all day today !
that sounds very scary , what happened ?
smart move honestly , better to be with a larger group than to be alone . glad you are ok .
how are you still friends ?
i have a few friends who are way better off than i am . it makes me a bit sad about my situation .
that ' s cool ! maybe he will be the magic johnson of the family . hey you never know !
yeah all you can do is encourage and support him . i hope everything works out and that he becomes rich and famous someday !
it ' s great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times .
yeah it really is . we just slap everything on our computer or online these days . it ' s just not the same .
hey it happens to the best of us . were you able to clean it up well ?
oh no that ' s awful ! i hadn ' t realized it was carpet . as a clumsy person , that could ' ve definitely been me in your situation so i get it .
that ' s great to hear . was it a boy or a girl ?
children are so amazing , and life changing . i hope your sister is ready for all the challenges that awake her .
oh really ? ! what did they find ?
oh yu ##ck ! ! ! that is terrible ! i have heard of people getting really sick from this black mold in the house . what are you going to do ?
i hate spiders . there is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed .
well that sounds terrible . it is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere .
and how did you feel about taking another person ' s forgotten belongings ?
that ' s a good way of seeing it i suppose .
sounds like it going to be an interesting trip
i can imaging the anticipation , but before you know it , you ' ll be on the beach
congratulations ! i fail to see the relevance between having a good grade and shopping however . are you being rewarded for your grades ?
oh definitely ! i hope your shopping day exceeds your expectations !
was he using it or something ? why did you think it was him , and how did you find out it was you ?
you have a secret spot for your head ##phones . are they super expensive ?
i have zero kids . i break stuff all the time .
no just ridiculous ##ly careless .
i ' ve never been there . i think it would be intimidating .
my dad and uncle actually went camping down there . you go with a guide and you set up camp in a few different places .
im the same , but i think in a place like the grand canyon , it ' s really dangerous to try to go down there alone .
yes , i know i wouldn ' t mind riding the donkey or mule down there .
good luck . i hope you do really well during the interview .
it sounds like the job is a great fit for you . i really hope you get it .
oh no that ' s terrible ! did you end up finding her purse ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . hopefully your niece feels better now and hasn ' t lost too much .
oh dear . i am so sorry that happened to you . were you hurt ?
that must have been terrifying . i am glad that you are okay .
that is so annoying . did you need it for a special occasion ?
i hope they at least gave you your money back .
sorry to hear that . i lost both my grandparents in the same year .
from what year ?
i know what you mean . me too ! what was your favorite part about the 90s ?
good point !
how come ? is your sister a minor and are you an adult ?
that doesn ' t sound fair at all , i wonder why she did that .
if i were you , i would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters ; items and not yours . that ' s so mean .
now that i think of it , it most likely is the reason why ; maybe she doesn ' t even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it . regardless it is important to share how you ' re feeling with her .
that could be creepy depending on the person . i ' m extra paranoid though .
that ' s understand ##able , there ' s just no way to be sure what a stranger ' s intentions are .
that ' s great ! consistency is key !
and you ' re building trust with your dog as well ! it ' s a win - win . : )
kids like touching and looking at things , i ' m sure no real harm was done . people like making a big deal out of everything .
i ' d say ignore them as best as you can . it ' s normal for kids to do these kind of things !
i am happy for you . how did it feel
that sounds like a great experience
i am usually that way , whenever i have a doctor ' s appointment . i hope everything went well .
ah . there you go so you were worried about nothing . i am glad that all was well .
oh , that ' s a shame - cooking ' s such fun . why did you stop cooking ?
go ##sh , i couldn ' t afford to do that ! it ' s far cheaper for me to cook up a big pot of stew or something and freeze it for busy days .
that stuff ' s hard to come by ! it ' s so easy to chuck stuff in a pot and then go watch tv or do something else for a couple of hours . tastes better , too !
i wish i had a slow cooke ##r . or one of those instant pots everyone ' s ravi ##ng about .
it
it ' s weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless . it ' s nice you had a good experience seeing your school .
our past can be a great source of strength and comfort .
would you be able to go meet him instead ?
that sucks . i would be disappointed also . hopefully ya ##ll can make some time soon to get together .
did you get any news back ?
i hope you do get the job , you deserve it !
sorry to here that , it must be tough for you at this moment
but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever .
oh my dad loves football too . i bet you have some great memories .
did you and your dad ever play football together ?
do you have a patio or backyard to do that in ?
i am so jealous of you then ha
you must have been really prepared to be so certain of achieving a perfect score !
i hope you do get that perfect score , you deserve it after all !
that is really neat do you have a kid ?
i would go at ##lea ##st you would get cake
wow ! is that old for an i ##gua ##na ? im sorry to hear that
my daughter wants an i ##gua ##na . i am scared of animals
she is . she may be able to handle it on her own . thanks for the info
that can be frustrating . did you do anything to help ?
oh that is terrible , cash ##iers should have more patience .
was the cake that good , or were you trying to make him angry ?
maybe you could make it up to him . i ' m sure he ' ll get over it though .
i guess he really need it . did you give him the money ?
well , at least you gave him something . he could buy a burger at mcdonald ' s
did she end up being able to go ?
well i hope she is able to attend , if not , you know it ' s nothing personal !
i dislike people who do that . i never understood why ! have you tried talking to him ?
oh i believe you . typically those type of people aren ' t people you can reason with .
i do that sometimes to you , memories are always nice
i look forward to that when i have a kid
is it your birthday ?
that ' s nice . i wish my brothers did that for me .
what kind of event is it ?
oh ##h fun , i love the artistic nature of some . my daughter just got a tattoo in honor of me .
that happened to me once . it was terrifying . were you okay ?
that is true . we don ##t get a lot of snow here . i don ##t think anyone knows how to deal with it
how did you end up doing ?
wow , that is unfortunate , i hope you are okay financially . . .
what did he get you instead ?
that ##s not ok i have been in that situation before and have made my girlfriend a card , wrote her a poem something .
that is not cool at all . why would he say that ? maybe he mis ##placed it .
that must have made you feel angry . i am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him .
i love good books , what was it about ?
that sounds really deep and dramatic , i think i would like that one . you might like books like " the deep end of the ocean " also .
i love sitting on the porch when the weather is nice .
where i live , it was really nice too . there was a cool breeze and no mosquito ##es out .
i imagine that would be a bit un ##ner ##ving . it being dark and anything being possible .
that sounds creepy , i would have to start keeping protection with me just in case .
did she accept ? i ' m sure you would be great to go out with .
i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m sure you will find someone who feels the same about you .
my parents are no longer living
its okay , i have good memories
really , me going to get relax by having beer
yeah , well i am not a reader but i love to play video games so much
that is good , is he struggling now ?
did you ask him about it , or did he make a big change to high school . sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in .
did you get hurt ?
i know the feeling . did a lot of people see ?
love is a great thing for sure
i am with you on that one
uh oh . do you think it is something major ?
well i hope it isn ##t too expensive . maybe it will be a smaller issue .
that ' s fantastic ! hopefully you ' ll hear something about it soon .
i ' m sure you did . think positive !
how old was it ?
that ' s terrible . i ' m so sorry . you ' ll never forget him .
why do you feel that way ?
i am so sorry . i hope you can make friends , try to join some sort of activities to meet people .
are you a browns fan ?
i see , well then i ' m sorry that worked out wrong for you .
what problems do you need to handle ?
i got you , well i hope that you get to that position at some point soon !
i do understand what you are saying . there are good cops and bad cops .
and sometimes it has to do with race , it is really a sad situation .
i hate when that happens
damn that sucks . well at least you can get a fresh pair
that sounds so fun ! i always wanted to get a tattoo !
i know . i have a friend who has both arms covered .
what kind of cake was it
that sounds so good
how did that make you feel
its nice to be alone sometimes
has he been sick ?
i hope he is okay .
what kind was it ?
those are pretty nice trucks ; /
what kind of business is it
i might need to apply then !
i love buffet ##s . what kind of food did they have ?
it happens to the best of us . at least you were able to get more since it was a buffet .
happens to the best of us
there are still some nice people left .
that is the best way to feel during an interview . im sure you did a good job .
ill keep my fingers crossed for you .
where are you going
that sounds so fun
wow ! how trauma ##ti ##zing ! were you scared at that time ?
oh man , i think your mother regretted that after knowing she almost hurt her family . that is quite awful to think about .
that ' s cool . what was the last thing they did for you
wow that ' s pretty awe ##se ##ome . . . you must have put in a lot of hard work to earn it
why is that ?
i suppose that is true to an extent , that makes sense
congratulations . sounds like you ace ##d it
i bet you will make a great bartender , maybe one of these days you will hook me up with a free drink
that ' s terrible ! i can ' t imagine how hard that is .
that ' s very sweet of you . she ' s going to need her friends to help her through this !
that is awesome ! how much did you win ?
that is absolutely amazing ! lucky you
aw i ' m sorry to hear that . i bet you have a lot of good memories .
i remember my dad watching football so much as a kid . i used to get so bored .
did it hurt though
i am sorry , i would cu ##ss too if it happened to me
aw that ' s cute . father - son / father - daughter bonding moments are something i miss out on .
it sounds like you and your father got along well , and that isn ' t always the case in families . i ' m happy to hear that .
that is so scary . i don ' t know what i would have done ,
you did the right thing . i wouldn ' t have been able to stop thinking about it .
that must be a wonderful feeling , now you are on your own .
ah , so you are now a lone ##r , you should try to make friends .
where did you go ?
yeah i got to a few places like that
oh awesome ! what are the tickets for ?
that will be fun .
oh that sounds dramatic . how did it turn out ?
i ' m glad you worked it out !
a new job can be a little nerve wr ##ack ##ing . did it get better , once you settled in ?
that ' s great . it sound like it ' s really working out for you .
i wish i was that lucky ! i always lose .
that is worse . i would have been so jealous and annoyed .
that sucks . did you have a hard time with it ?
maybe you can get a tutor this time .
you could always start saving now
you can if you want
that is great ! are you really excited ?
i hope your date goes well ! stay optimistic and positive !
awesome ! you are extremely lucky . will you be bringing anyone with you .
du ##h ! you better , i do hope you have a whale of a time . i would be el ##ated .
wow that is a pre ##dic ##ament
that was probably a good idea
oh my go ##sh ! that is so funny . was he really embarrassed ?
i can understand that . but its still really funny . my husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that .
aw ##w ##w ! sounds like you ' re a great parent !
i hope i can be a mom someday !
how do you think you did ?
well i hope it works out for you !
i am glad you met someone .
everyone needs close friends to talk to and hang ##out with .
did they knock and leave ?
you should put a camera there . you can see it from your phone .
are you excited or dread ##ing it ?
good for you . i hope you get a good start .
awesome , when ##s ' the first date ?
awe ##oms ##e , always great to see people forming new relationships .
ou ##ch ! did you trip over a cord ?
did you hurt yourself ?
oh yeah ? i ' m guessing you ' re not a big fan of roller coaster ##s ?
aw ##w i ' m sorry you didn ' t like it . roller coaster ##s can be pretty scary , even for people like me who enjoy them .
that ' s great ! did you win it on a table game or at a machine ?
did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more ?
i understand . i play every now and again and i usually quit while i ' m ahead . it always ends up that i ' m waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home !
yeah - the first time i went with friends , i won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino . i told myself that if i won money like that again , i ' d just stop and take the money home . it works out well !
does he do that often that is not ok
yeah that is really not ok
oh wow . i have never done that
well that is great . i think people get upset over other people actions when it comes to facebook .
what kind of puppy did you get ?
those are \ big right ?
accidents happen . are you feeling better .
i heard that was going around .
yi ##kes . i ' m sorry to hear . will there be other chances available for promotion ?
i ' d be pretty upset , too . did anyone give a reason why your cow ##or ##ker was chosen over you ?
what is dove season ?
oh ! i didn ' t know people hunted them ! what is used to hunt them ? shotgun ##s ?
you sound confident . what subject is the class ?
awesome . i ' m sure you ' ll do well then .
that is so nice you must be really looking forward to that . will you be traveling alone ?
make sure you take lots of pictures and prepare for the weather .
you must have been really scare ! could you sleep after that ?
i imagine , i am easily scared with these kind of movies , so i don ' t watch them much .
that ' s cool what ' s your favorite part about it
nice , you ' re never too old to go trick or treating ha ##ha
were you competing ?
that ##s too bad . what do you do now ?
how did you like it ?
great ! a new look can certainly help feel ref ##resh ##ed , at lea ##s it does it for me .
are you planning to attend ?
i hope you have a great time !
you are a loyal friend . i do hope your friend will learn from his mistakes .
yes , i have that one friend and you don ' t want to give up on him . i hope he gets it together soon
that ' s cool . what kind of benefits
that ' s great . do they offer dental and vision
bahamas is a nice caribbean island , you must be really looking forward to it .
i can just imagine , make sure you take lots of pictures and dress for the weather . it will be hot .
that was so nice of him !
you are lucky to have a nice dad .
what did you end up doing ?
oh , well i hope it works out well for you !
i ' m so sorry to hear that . death is never easy to deal with .
i hope all your family was doing well .
how odd . sounds like a sc ##am .
did you look into the situation further ? did you call your phone company and see what they had to say about it ?
that ' s a good thing . a lot of people ( like me ! ) hate / hated it . she ' ll do so much better if she ' s happy .
how old is she ? is she studying something she can use later in life ?
oh , well goodness , encourage her ! the sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy she ' ll get out of it !
no , it certainly isn ' t ! hopefully , she ' ll keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life . think what a gift that must be !
that ' s a good idea . it ' s best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation , as you never know when it can happen .
yes , as a wife and mother , i know i usually look to my husband for guidance and strength in situations like that !
i feel sure as well , you are clearly determined and intentional .
that ' s the beauty of it , i feel motivated now so i need to keep an eye out on my local job market .
pro ' s and con ' s . those systems are abuse prone but , some people need them .
it can be in ##fur ##iating . for example , over a 3 year period in my own state , there was about ~ 20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots ( florida , hawaii , california , virgin islands )
why didn ' t you go
or it could be you and a do ##pe house party
or it could be you and a do ##pe house party
that should be an awesome feeling . i do wish you all the best in life .
you ' re welcome ! you have your whole life ahead of you , you are a star .
how come ? what do your brothers do to ann ##oy you ?
i hope they don ' t do it on purpose to ann ##oy you !
that is terrible . did the police find them ?
i hate that people do things like that .
i love eating at casino ' s . they have some of the best food .
did you win anything ?
yeah it happens my little bro drives me crazy sometimes
same here how old is your little bro ?
wow i am so sorry to hear that , my grandmother passed from cancer about 10 years ago
i get that , i will pray for her , best of luck friend
that is nice . you must have a nice body and i am glad that you feel better about yourself .
true , if one is not happy about something the best thing is to switch things up .
sorry to hear that rip
do you have any other pets
that is awesome ! what all do you have going on ?
that is great , you are very lucky and blessed !
wow , what are you going to do ?
i would maybe hit him or get revenge at least
was she upset !
what will you get her ?
what sport is that ? sorry but i don ' t know anything about it .
ok , sorry i didn ' t know . i hope the play better next time !
oh my go ##sh . i am not surprised they denied any wrong doing . i think that is typical of mechanics . what do you plan to do about it ?
i think bad reviews are important though . a lot of people use those to determine where they go for service . you may save someone else the trouble you have .
that sounds great ! have you not seen them in a while ?
it will be good to catch up with them ! family is all that matters .
i ' m looking forward to it too ! i remember playing smash on the n ##64 . i loved it .
sweet . i hope to meet you on the battlefield someday !
you sound excited ? do you do it up big ?
what are you going to do this year ?
that ' s an interesting theme . are you going to make the costumes your self ?
that sounds like lots of fun !
what do you hunt ?
i didn ##t even know there was a dove season . i actually never even went camping before
i want to some day .
that is good , i am glad you can trust him like that !
that is awesome , i am glad you have that type of relationship !
wow , that is great ! you must have been very excited and grateful !
i hope you enjoy your card very much !
congratulations ! it always warm ##s my heart to hear about a happy loyal companions ##hip .
well , it has been for three years so that ' s a great sign !
i can ' t say i ' m a huge fan of fried chicken . did you enjoy it at least ?
e ##w that ' s gross ! can ' t you get sick from partially cooked chicken ?
oh wow , that must have been lovely . how was it living in paradise ?
well i hope for you that one day you can . maybe retirement ! man , that would be amazing .
i could not agree more with you . but it seems like a lot of politicians either don ' t care or are not putting enough resources into combat ##ing climate change .
if all people do is pray , then certainly nothing will change . it ' s time to start acting instead of wishing for things to change if we want to our children and grandchildren to see a future .
aw ##w that is sweet are you going ?
aw ##w well do what you think is best
well i would go on the date then buy the kid a big present .
aw ##w ##w . i remember that feeling with my first kid
it is . just wait until he says " dad ##a " you will melt lo ##l
what movie do you plan to watch ?
oh i ' ve seen that , it is not too bad ! i had fun watching it .
i used to love them . i can ##t believe that are still performing
i thought they were so much better that ns ##yn ##c too lo ##l
i hate when someone does that , it can be so annoying : )
no need to go that far , just make sure your friend has not seen the movie before and go out and enjoy it .
what did you do ?
that is true , that is lame though
its always good to have solid family members . not everyone has that .
that ' s good to hear .
i bet you hate having to leave and i am sure she misses you .
you must be proud of her . that is great .
she must have a lot of faith in you .
ou ##ch ! i hope he was okay !
are your not liking your new job ?
that ' s no good . what are you going to do ?
i am sorry you are feeling lonely . why don ' t you see your friends much anymore , are you all to busy >
yes i know what you mean , that has happened to me too .
wow what kind of toys did you find
the nostalgia must have been so good !
nice ! would you like to send the cleaning fairy round to my place ? !
what a wonderful daughter you have . she has a very good heart . you ' ve obviously been an excellent parent !
definitely both of you : ) maybe go to an ice cream parlor or a spa ?
or even do both ! is your daughter in school ?
oh wow , that must be exciting ! is this your first home ?
i hope you do , too . i will definitely throw in a prayer or two that you do !
does it still work ?
nice . i love finding old stuff from my childhood .
that ' s pretty rude . are you going to buy him some more beer .
man . . i ' m glad you ' re not my roommate .
wow did anyone see ?
dan ##g , it must have been embarrassing
you are exactly like me . those were the good old days
my youngest ##s are 3 and 4 now . those days are gone
that sounds exciting ! , are you nervous ?
that is true , but you will meet new people and learn a lot !
congratulations ! ! how did it feel when you found out ?
how cool ! cong ##rat ##s again on your new addition , i ' ll keep you in my thoughts and pray you get some sleep in the next 12 months ha ##ha
that is great news ! you must be really proud of him !
that is good positive reinforcement ! cong ##rat ##s to your kid !
okay , i am sorry that it was not up to your standard . i have not seen it as yet .
okay , i understand . i am thinking of watching it .
oh no . how long was the power out for ?
that sounds awful !
how does that make you feel
well i wish you the best of luck . if you ' re hard ##working then you ' ll make it
oh cool ! i bet it ' s also nice not having a boss breathing down your neck , right ?
i have been in the past . right now i ' m part time with some work at home / stuff . so yeah i do remember liking not having a boss the most !
well , that ' s a good present ! i ' m sure you are excited to get it .
that ' s right , you do . i have a hard time doing that myself and should realize i deserve it as well too .
that sounds horrible ! good thing you are all right and only walked away with a little shame !
that ' s good . it could have been a lot worse !
i would be too ha ##ha . . . who ##s fault was it
how old is your kid
that ' s cool that you ' re active . does she go to college or what
got ##cha . i make sure to call my mom at least twice a week , i ' m 26 and i ' ve got my own apartment as well
that ' s really awesome , i ' m happy for your success and encourage you to enjoy yourself .
so far so good , just trying to stay cool . good conversations are helping .
that is wonderful news . that is a lot of money to win . i am happy for you .
oh yes , you can relax a bit and pay some bills .
amazing . those things seem to never pay out . that is a lot .
i know that feeling . did you treat yourself after winning ?
i ' m a boston boy but i gotta give em props
people hate on brady cu ##z he ' s been gold since day 1 . but the eagles came ready on defense that ' s for sure
that is good , that is what we hit the gym for right ?
i do , i have been trying to bulk ##up , i am 6 ' 4 190 and need some more on my frame
that could be awkward . i wonder what made him feel he could do that ?
hopefully he got the point and won ##t ask again .
i am happy that you reached home safely . you have to be very careful when traveling at nights .
we are living in a cruel world , i am just happy that you are fine .
i know the feeling , my little nephew used to beat me at mortal ko ##mba ##t constantly just by button smashing . how did your little brother get so good at wii ?
ah ##hh ! well at least you found out it was just user error and not that he was actually better than you !
nothing wrong with being emotional . it ' s healthy . i get a bit emotional about that stuff too . family and friends are extremely important .
if they don ' t , that ' s their loss . my family are so important to me - i love them dear ##ly . the same goes for my close friends . don ' t listen to other people - they ' re the ones missing out !
he must trust you a lot .
i hope you guys have fun
that is nice . we are suppose to trust our spouse ##s .
i know one has to earn trust .
that is a lot of kids , imagine raising that many kids !
wow , that is huge , they must have ab ##os ##rb ##ed kids from another duck or something
i am so very sorry for your loss . i lost my mom last year .
it is a very long process , but it is true that time does help a tiny bit .
oh no . were you still at subway ?
i know the feeling . its hard to work when you are hungry .
i bet you were em ##bara ##ssed
what happened ? you had too many bills to pay .
ha ##ha . well at least you treated yourself now you are broke .
yes you will be looking cute and get a lot of attention
now you ' re talking . that would be nice ; )
what is wake - board . that sounds a bit scary .
i bet it is , i am afraid of water , i cannot swim so i know for a fact i would not be trying that . i hope you have fun .
that no good ! how long will he be gone ?
just hold on a little longer ! you will feel better when he gets back !
that ' s great . hopefully they eat a lot of food !
i am sure they will have a great time
you must be very proud of yourself . i am proud of you . you are a star .
so you really surprised yourself . i guess you studied hard .
sometimes it just takes a time and you need to stay pro ##active . i know it can be disappointing .
just keep a budget and stay strict . it will gradually get better .
i think i have seen that movie
i like animated movies . i have lots of kids lo ##l
do you miss your family
nice i ' m in tx and my fa ##m ' s in mn . i try to visit them at least once a year
oh how exciting ! how did she do ?
amazing , you must feel really proud !
cong ##rat ##s ! how exciting !
good luck ! i am sure it will be fine .
oh ##h man , i am so sorry . i have had that happen to me many times over the last five years . did you contact your landlord ?
it is wonderful that you have family that can help . are you going to be ok going forward ?
that was really nice of you ! you must have a really caring heart !
that cat will love you forever !
i have never been on a roller coaster . i would be very scared too .
ha ##ha ##ha you are going to scream , i hope you don ##t pu ##ke . it should be fun though .
aw ##w ##w that is so sweet . did he go to a good home ?
that is good to hear . i hope he lives a good life .
how are you feeling about it ? are you sad ?
i am sorry about it , did she move close by or to another town ?
i bet you will be ball ##ing . i hope you remember the poorer folks like me .
that sounds grand : ) it ' s a deal i am root ##ing for you .
and what movie did you guys see
wow that must have been a while back . . . do you still keep in touch with these friends
good luck ! i am sure that it will go well .
i hope you find out soon .
oh my go ##sh . i am so sorry . what happened ?
oh no . poor thing ! hope you are hanging in there .
that is good , reading always relax ##es me too .
yes , curling up in bed with those things can relax you like nothing else !
that is exciting ! how long will it take before they give you and answer ?
i hope everything goes great and you get your new home !
ah a patriots fan . sorry about that , but they ' ve been so great in the past , you should feel pride in that .
he really is a talented player , i must admit .
how was that experience for you
you must have been proud . but she wouldn ' t be there if you didn ' t persistent ##ly push her to do her best
i am glad to hear that . it can take a lot for some people to be confident like that . i am glad you got over your issues with it .
yeah , i know exactly what you mean .
i ' ve had that happen before . its like they are trying to become professionals at it . was it a who ##pper ?
i think they would lie sooner if they could . my kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he could ' ve so i knew instantly . its humorous while they ' re young watching them get into such a deep hole .
are you going to have a surprise party ?
i know that is hard , but it ' s alright if you do it for the right reasons . you all will be able to laugh about it when it ' s all over . have fun !
oh gee ##z , i know how that is . how long do you think it had been that way ?
that ' s pretty interesting . well , i hope you get that all sorted out !
wow , good for you finding the courage to overcome your fear ! i can understand why you were nervous after what you went through .
i completely understand . your parents sound like great people .
that is great . do you still swim ?
well you can start slowly , i ' m sure you will find your motivation again
that is so exciting ! i love babies . do you know what his name will be ?
that ##s a neat way to decide on a name . we picked our kids names months in advance . luckily their names fit them well .
soo ##oo how was it ?
oh no ha ##ha . i ' m guessing you at least had to be polite and pretend like you didn ' t want to pu ##ke ?
crazy , was it like the movies ?
reminds me of that eddie murphy movie !
l ##ma ##o sounds like a confident dude
or he ' s looking for his soul ##mate
i hear you . i still love the mc ##nu ##gg ##ets , but i never eat them since i went vega ##n .
it ' s the best , but it is hard to give up the delicious fried meat ##s , though .
oh my goodness ! what happened ? !
i bet you and your date were shaken up !
did you crash ! ?
i am so sorry that happened to you !
that stink ##s . i always feel left out when that happens to me . even more so when i know the people from my best friend ' s work so when i can ' t be involved , its hard . how do you feel about it ?
i ' m sorry . make sure to reach out to her and tell her how you feel . if she ' s a good friend , she ' ll understand and make an effort to make time for you but don ' t let it make you bitter .
how terrifying ! did the intruder took anything or was he just some kind of creep ?
that is so awful . i imagine you won ' t feel safe again until you get the alarm . you can also get a big dog to help you keep safe .
oh man , that would have freaked me out what did you do ?
it seems your daughter may over ex ##agger ##ate things a little bit .
why did you do it ? do you now feel bad about it ?
well maybe you can tell your friend and ask him / her to forgive you .
well if you trained as hard as you stated , i am sure you will do great !
sounds like a great plan . good luck !
that ' s what ##s up !
keep it up . failure is for d ##wee ##bs .
ou ##ch , that sounds so painful ! no i have never have them . do you know you can avoid them in the future ?
that is great that your wife took such great care of you ! i hope you are now feeling completely recovered .
oh , really ? was something wrong ?
i can understand your feelings ; but i suspect you made the right decision . maybe it is something you can talk with your friend about . a good friend will understand .
oh no ! did you find out who ?
you should look for camera in the area , they could help you catch the per ##p .
what are you getting certified for ? it seem that you were wee ##l prepared .
that is great . i wish you the best of luck !
that ' s cool . was he better than cr ##is angel
what kind of tricks did he do
congratulations ! it takes a lot of courage to move away from home like that .
it ' s great that you ' re so positive about life .
oh you are such a great wife ! i think he will totally appreciate it ! are you doing anything nice for him ?
oh , sounds very romantic ! have fun my friend !
oh no . are you scared at all ?
well if you do decide to go through with it , i wish you the best and quick healing !
oh my , what did you have surgery for ?
that ' s really nice ! i hope you recover really quick !
great ! i ' m sure you ' ve prepared a lot for it . good luck !
i ' m sure you ' ll do well .
oh how exciting ! i love the beach ! are you bringing lots of snacks and drinks ?
oh yes don ' t forget the sun block . very important ! well i hope you all have fun out there ! i am jealous !
they must have tasted good !
lesson learned , that ' s for sure
guess you ' re just going to have to evacuate or something !
better not go on any planes !
oh no ! i hate when things like that happen . you can sometimes still get it if you try to speak to the manager
ye ##a . . . sometimes gym managers tend not to be there which is a pain . i hope it works out for you , though !
you must feel awful about it ! what are you going to do ? are you telling your friend ?
yes i believe it is better . i hope your friend understand .
that sounds sad . what are you getting distracted from ?
well , that sounds ad ##mir ##able . focusing on making money so you can be independent .
try me
ha ##ha oh man did the owner get mad . . . or did he just laugh it off
that is awesome . what changed ?
can fat really turn into muscles ? asking for myself ? lo ##l
i rented a co ##roll ##a once . it had great responsive ##ness , was speeding like a mo ##fo
i ' m more of a honda guy tb ##h . my civic lasted me a 21 ##hr nonstop drive from mn to south tx and she still runs good as new
gross ! that must have been disgusting !
that is true ! way to look at the bright side !
how scary ! thank god nothing bad happened after all .
that is the important thing , i always keep reminding myself to focus while driving too .
true , you must be feeling nos ##tal ##gic , kids going back to school and all
someone needs to in ##vent a time machine !
that is awesome . i too have had the same issues .
i wouldn ' t eat until 11 am and then stop eating by 9 ##pm
it ' s not as hard as i thought it would be . certainly helps with staying within a certain amount of cal ##ories per da ##ay .
aw ##w , why ' s that ? do you live in an older home > ?
hey , don ' t worry about what other people think ! as long as you have a safe roof over your head and your family is happy , that ' s all that matters !
oh no . did they do damage or steal anything ?
that is definitely scary . i don ' t understand why people want to steal from others . get a dan ##g job !
was that for work ?
i ' m sure you are going to do great . i really hope you do get a better paying job as a result . good luck !
oh that sucks ! how far do you live from the venue ?
sorry you missed the concert . that is a bum ##mer ! but it came with some per ##ks i guess . you met a girl !
what a nice story and how wonderful to feel so protected !
yes i am sure that have make you or will make you in the future a wonderful parent too !
oh no ! i hope that you get well soon and that the tests come back okay !
me too ! i ' m not sure what you might be going through but do consider making sure your ##e eating a good amount of fruits and ve ##gg ##ies . herbs too , they ' re all healing and helpful to the body .
good to hear , coffee is the bomb !
so much winning , but with coffee it never gets old
did she forgive you ?
that must ' ve been funny
je ##ez ##e , i hope he really had to go , otherwise he must have been slack ##ing off on purpose !
well that ' s good , at least he didn ' t do it on purpose . otherwise i would have found a way to get back at him . maybe lax ##ative ##s to make him really go !
oh , congratulations ! that ' s awesome . when ' s the wedding ?
i can imagine . now you have to get planning the wedding . should be fun
that was very careless of him , i ' m sorry .
maybe you should talk with him and let him know how serious of an issue it is to you .
sorry to hear that , i ' m glad you were prepared .
you did the right thing . you should always stay ready for a disaster .
cool , what did you study ?
nice , i bet you can ' t wait to graduate .
those are such high payments , be sure to get your plan based on your income , it really helps .
yes , the us takes advantage of the need for education . i hope you find a job you love , and don ' t forget that they have lots of payment options .
oh that sounds mean . how did you do ?
are you two still going out ?
well , that was terrible of you . why would you do that ?
wow . . . . i certainly hope so .
ou ##ch , i ' ve done that before . but how sweet of him , sounds like a keeper .
ah , so he had ul ##ter ##ior motives and wanted the chores done ! just kidding . glad you ' re feeling better .
oh no ! did they help you find another home / let you stay with them for a while ?
that is so great ! its good to know that there are still good people in this world
i love those . that must have brought up some nice memories .
oh i see . are you far from home ?
cong ##rat ##s ! did he choose wise ##ly ?
well , you did say it was one you really wanted . how nice of him to do that for you .
oh , that must be heartbreak ##ing for you . do you know where he is ?
that would be the best birthday present ever ! i know he ' ll make every effort possible to be with you .
i am so sorry to hear that . that kind of news is always hard to receive .
they have all kinds of treatments for cancer now . he should have a fighting chance .
sorry to hear that . what happened to him ?
oh that is a nice surprise . i bet you caught up with each other .
je ##ez , wonder why they left it there for that long ?
who knows , that ' s a waste of a good sandwich though !
that must make you angry . can you report him ?
i understand . hopefully he fix ##es it for you .
no way ! ! are you ok ?
did they take anything valuable ?
every found out why they didn ' t show up ?
well that ' s understand ##able . hope you had a great party afterwards !
that must be amazing ! i wish i had your job
it would make me feel amazing to see their face !
oh that is cool ! i bet you are proud .
it is paying off . that is such a fun age .
oh no . that sounds annoying . know what ' s causing it ?

that ' s unfortunate . a hit and run is terrible
i hope things look better . my friend dealt with a similar issue
that ' s un ##fort ##uan ##te . i bet he is good now
what university or college ?
oh how exciting ! are you at all worried how they ' ll take being separated ?

i am so sorry . that is horrible . now what ?
that must be so difficult . i hope all turns out well .
awesome . that is a huge accomplishment .
you must be very proud . can ##t wait to see what he does next .
wow ! that is amazing
i have never had that happen to me
that ' s disgusting ! hopefully you got a ref ##und or your food rec ##ook ##ed ?
good , i bet you were mad . at least they made it right though .
well hopefully you will see them again soon . i ' m sure they will .
you must find joy in your life - something you are passionate about
you must be anxious and excited ! was it expected ?
hope everything goes as planned !
that is so sad . did you find out who did it ?
i feel so sorry for you . i love my pets too .
how exciting ! what kind of car is it ?
oh sounds nice . hopefully he doesn ' t have any accidents in it .
where will the show be ?
that sounds amazing ! check out the french quarter while you are there .
i love the weather that time of the year . i agree , it is so much fun .
that is awesome . i love all the food and time off .
you sound like a great uncle ! you must be proud of him !
that is great that you are there to help him out !
i hate to ask why you walked back out
gross , i don ' t blame you , public restroom ##s are always disgusting
o ##oh fun ! has it been long since the last time you saw them ?
that will be nice to have some time to catch up . have fun !
yes , i love big trips . i spend hours packing !
that ' s de ##bat ##able !
that ' s awesome ! congratulations .
that ' s great . you have quite the household it seems !
that ' s unfortunate . sometimes used cars can be tough to deal with
i hope not . i have a feeling things will get better
oh no ! i have had that happen to me before , too .
good , i would have too !
i ' m sure you ' ll do great ! have you been preparing ?
good luck ! don ' t be nervous . i ' m sure you ' ll knock it out of the park !
congratulations ! that ' s awful ! do they not have kids themselves ? its a pretty typical thing to happen when you ' re the first to have a baby among them and they don ' t understand that lifestyle . i ' ve been there .
i ' m so sorry . my sister was in the very same situation as you and i can tell you , she made it through and her daughter is 9 now . she kept taking a day at a time and working hard and went back to school to become a nurse . you can do it to . find some true friends who will support you no matter what .
i am so sorry to hear this . i am sure you will find another job , but it doesn ' t make it any less painful .
just have faith , i am sure it will all turn out !
that ' s sounds like a lovely night . i bet it was wonderful
i love the guitar , too ! that ' s marvelous
oh my goodness . i ' m so sorry to hear that .
how old was your friend ?
wow , you are so caring
oh ##hh , so how is she now ?
that ' s exciting ! i wish you the best of luck !
it ' s already yours , hopefully ! if not , that means there ' s something out there better for you . : )
i ' m so sorry ! you must ' ve been so sad . did you find out who did it ?
oh thank goodness ! i hate hearing people losing their pets .
that ' s awesome . where to ?
i hope you have a splendid time ! that might be great
that is bitter ##sw ##eet ! what is his name ?
that is a unique name , i have 3 sons myself .
i would have been scared , too ! was it by fault or was someone attempting to break in ?
mine did that , too . we had to replace the motion sensor .
that ##s great ! what is ll ##ws ?
that ' s great ! my kids played baseball
how exciting ! what is it ?
om ##g ! that really is the best birthday present ever !
that must have been really exciting . did you think you had lost it ?
were you really close to her ?
that ' s unfortunate . you will get the next one , i am sure .
i bet your employer still knows how much you have put in
that sounds fun ! has it been a while since you seen your family ?
i am glad you are getting to see them !
are you a nurse ?
that is awesome ! my sister is a cn ##a now but in school to become a nurse . have you worked in any other settings as a nurse ?
a new mom ? good question , maybe offer to mo ##w their lawn ? i don ' t really know ha ##ha
welcome , and yeah i always disliked mo ##wing the lawn !
i ' m glad . you seem very happy
i ' m glad you have a great family !
ah that is de ##pressing ! what state ?
wow that is a long move !
i bet it gets lonely
yes there are . can ' t trust anyone these days .

i think i heard about them in the news .
i ' m so sorry . i recently just lost both of my grandparents within a year . i know how you feel .
it really is . getting older is not fun .
oh my go ##sh ! me too . it literally makes my skin crawl .
i agree . i avoid going to stores during busy times because i just can ##t handle being around so many people .
oh no ! spaghetti sauce is so tough to get out
lo ##l i am sorry about that ! hopefully you can get it out
me too . it is a huge pet pee ##ve of mine .
right ? get out of the way !
was you way down yo ##nder on the chat ##ta ##ho ##oche ##e ?
hmm ##m . . . not as interesting
oh man i hate waiting on test results ! gets my anxiety to extreme levels .
well i ' m glad to hear you have a clean bill of health !
life is not fair for anybody
yeah , as long as you have a car you are better than most people
she ##esh that is terrible . i would have a hard time not leaving
well hopefully something else will come up for you !
that sure do , how old is your son ?
that is so exciting . . enjoy this time with him .
i love eating out at a restaurant with great food ! too bad it ' s too expensive to go every night !
yeah , i enjoy cooking but it can be so time consuming .
i would have shot back , that is un ##cal ##led for
maybe you should cut his brakes
that sounds really cool . is her blog very popular ?
oh my goodness ! that is so awesome . i would love to be able to do something like that .
that ##s one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it . now the value has sky ##rock ##ete ##d .
i didn ##t know that . i guess not .
that is bad how did it happen
what happened afterwards
what did he do
oh my ! that is horrible !
oh wow ! i guess he didn ' t care !
that is the truth , no shame in his game .
interesting . . . what are you going for ?
that is awesome , good luck
i do , too ! i always make my husband kill them .
i don ' t blame you ! get them all !
that is awesome . i hope he says yes !
well i wish both of you years of happiness together !
probably didn ' t last too long when you got back though i ' m guessing
it happens , i ' m sure they don ' t blame you !
does that mean what i think it means ? have you had a juicy flat ##ule ##nce experience ?
i wonder if there is anything you can do about that .
oh my that is horrible , i hope you find it !
man there are some crap ##py people in the world
did they get caught ?
did they take anything important ?
what were the left ##overs ?
i enjoy fried rice ! i hope she wasn ' t too upset .
nice , what did you do with it ?
ha ##ha yeah i guess you can ' t really return it at that point
any big plans ? my son just turned 4 . i ' ve been nos ##tal ##gic also .
that sounds fun ! have you been looking at the old baby pictures ?
that is a very nice thing to do ! i am a big animal lover .
me either . it breaks my heart .

do you think you have a good shot ?
is the interview soon ? good luck .
wow , where did he get it from ?
that ' s awesome , glad he ' s able to hand it down to the next generation
oh man that is so scary . did they steal anything ?
were you in the house ?
that is awesome ! i am happy for you !
that is what is most important !
that ' s funny , it ' s like you can see your kids and see yourself experiencing it when you were a kid
right , it ' s hard to imagine there was a time before you when you ' re little
that sounds nice ! i ' m sure they appreciate it a lot .
i bet ! good bonding time . how old is your son ?
wow how exciting ! what do you do ?
if you put forth the effort im sure you will
i ' m sorry . your boss still knows about the great work you have put in , though
yes you will ! that ' s a great attitude
wow that ' s actually hilarious . and very unfortunate
wow that ' s even fun ##nier . . . but even more unfortunate
oh , no . was it deadly ?
that is rough . i am glad you made it through .
are you nervous ? i ' m sure you ' ll do great if you prepared .
good luck ! i ' m sure you ' ll ace it !
i find myself not finishing potatoes either ! they take so long to cook
right , taste good too
i could only dream of having that . that must be nice .
i wish my company would allow me to do that .
that is faithful , you are a good dude
that is good , they are hard to find
oh , no ! were you alone ?
she must be a party animal .
flu ##ff that stink ##s , did you shoot em ?
she ##esh what a bum ##mer !
i do not like scary ! i try to stay away from scary movies , too !
it sounds like you had a good time though .
how fast were you going ?

i agree ! they look cool and are fun to play in the mud with
nice , must have been shopping with his wife .
mach ##o man lo ##l
that ' s funny , likes it ' s an extension as who they are as a person
i see , yeah sometimes you just gotta lead by example
man that was super lucky , most people would have taken it
exactly , it doesn ##t happen very often
really ? i don ##t watch much football
i like soccer
that was very nice of them . you weren ##t able to walk into an office and get it faster
oh then that makes sense . good thing they were willing to help
wow . twins . how rare is it to have them ?
man . that ##s very interesting . were you at all surprised to have twins then ?
i ' ve never tried that , do you bet money on it ?
nice , hope it goes well
slammed as in he got really drunk , or slammed as in he got into a fight ?
its been a while since i ' ve seen someone drunk
that is strange , i would have got out of there
i would be a little sp ##ook ##ed out by being alone
that stink ##s , did you go anyway ?
yeah they are , but so good
that is awesome . is it with the same company , or someone different ?
i hope you get it ! when will you find out ?
cool , what did you do about it ?
little bug ##ger , maybe next time
which movie did you see ?
i watched parts of it too . i didn ##t think it was that great either .
what is co - op ?
oh that is really neat ! i hope they like it
did you do or say anything ?
sometimes you got to set ##p in and say something though when you know something is not right .
were you leg ##it sick ?
lo ##l that happens to the best of us , don ##t feel bad
wow that is impressive . do you work with him ?
that is still not bad !
nice ! hope something horrible didn ' t happen to you just to get it . you getting a lot ?
wow ! that seems worth it ! ! ! ! wish it had happened to me ! ha ha . hope you ' re healthy still and congratulations !
that is awesome ! what breed ?
oh ok that is very nice of you
that ' s pretty scary . was it like a scene from taken ?
that sounds pretty awful . no thanks .
oh , that is irritating sometime ! that happens to me sometimes
lo ##l . i am guilty of hiding a couple of snacks for myself at times , nothing wrong with that
how did that go ?
no way ! i can not stand when people do shady things like that . we you able to get your stuff back ? did he get in trouble ?
yeah i would have been mad too . if he needed something he should have at least asked . stealing is never okay .
wow that is odd , is there nothing you can do about it ?
that is insane , i hope everything works out !
that sounds like a win ! did she get mad ?
this just happened ? oh boy ! maybe you can replace it before she gets up .
that ' s awesome . i hope you don ' t spend it all too quickly .
make sure the consultant doesn ' t try to rip you off either ha ##ha .
i hated chemistry in school , i hope you do well
it is a difficult subject no doubt
that ' s a good idea . hopefully , you had enough room
that ' s good news . i bet it was fun !
mmm , pizza sounds good . what ' s keeping you from ordering pizza yourself ? why let him have all the fun ?
go for it ! you ' ll only regret the pizza ##s you don ' t eat !
dan ##g , traffic must be intense in your area
true , driving takes more focus than a lot of people can handle
who ' s birthday is it ?
don ' t worry
do you feel bad about it ?
you should make it up to that person .
oh i do not like spiders either ! what did you do ?
i ' d probably have done the exact same thing - then called for my husband or one of my daughters to kill it ! !
oh no ! were you able to take care of him with medicine or treatments ?
i ' m so sorry ! i know how hard it is to lose a pet ! i hope you are not sad for too long . it sounds like you did everything you could to give it a great life .
that ' s good to hear , one of the best advantages you can have in life
and they ' re all you got in the end !
whoa , did you find out what it was ?
i don ##t blame you , i would have been terrified
it can be boring to drink at the bar by yourself .
that must be a cool bar to let pets in .
i have a problem getting rid of things too . sometimes you just have to throw it away , or donate it .
just leave the house and have someone trash it for you .
glad i could help .
oh no . i am so sorry to hear that . were you close with this cow ##or ##ker ?
than i completely understand that would be so hard
that would even make it worse . did it happen all of a sudden ?
i am so sorry for the loss . good friends are so hard to come by
nice , it ' s like little kids can learn anything !
that ' s awesome , hope he goes far
oh go ##sh ! are you ok ?
ha ##ha that ##s a good name . were you able to see it vivid ##ly ?
ou ##ch what a jerk . why did he do that ?
oh i hope you punched him back .
oh no ! was you at least at home when that happened ?
i bet that was embarrassing . was you drunk ?
im so sorry , i can not im ##ma ##gin ##e that
that is terrible
i can agree with that , adult ##ing sucks
i miss them as well
what do you mean ?
oh they ' re in your bubble . that stink ##s , some people are weird like that , no bound ##eries .
i truly do feel bad that you have to endure that . my girlfriend and i were just talking about how horrible she ' s going to feel when she loses her ha ##van ##ese pup at some point in the distant future , since she ' s so close to her . i hope you can gr ##ie ##ve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way .
i can appreciate why they ' d say that . they just want you to feel better . but it ' s all about to how you ' re feeling . you ' ll know in your gut when to get another pet , if you ever want to get another one . it ' s important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship .
that ' s wonderful ! you ' re right , it is so reward ##ing to stand back and see everything clean once you are done .
right , that ' s something you can at least have full control over . your own humble ab ##ode .
was your landlord truly trying their best , or did they simply not care about your well - being at that time ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle .
u ##gh . people like that are gross .
i know right . some people are too lazy .
wow i envy you . that sounds like a wonderful feeling !
thank you ! i hope to feel that content someday !
i didn ' t think that was possible for a dog on a walk ! what kind of dog do you have ?
that ' s quite the mix ! what ' s his name ?
funny you say that . . . my roommate just got a cat about a month ago . i was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it , as i ' m not the most fond of them . but i didn ' t want to say no . it ' s actually been an affection ##ate cat so far .
i suppose so . i ' ve never gr ##avi ##tated towards them . they seem like they only have one personality , and they ' re either nice or mean , and never warm up to you over time . so , i was a little wary of that .
what kind of hobby do you have ?
that is awesome ! what kind of boats do you make ?
that sounds like an ugly scene . . . did anybody step in
for real ? ha ##ha good job !
that is awesome ! i am happy for you !
i agree totally , it takes a strong person to admit they are like that
what kind of trouble is he having right now ?
oh no . that is no good ! it is hard to sit back and watch someone have a drug problem
good job . that can be really tough to go through that .
you are a good friend though . i wish i had more friends like you .
they ' ll understand , sometimes it ' s better not to over ##ex ##ten ##d yourself
better to rest so you can do everything you want tomorrow !
yes , i love it here . it is the greatest country in the world .
that is how i feel about it . i love my country .
dear lord , how old are you ?
i was joking . i haven ##t a cu ##rf ##ew since i was 17 . im an only child so wouldn ##t know much about favorites .
o no did you report it to the hospital
that is not ok i would make go to a higher up
you want to start school back up ? what are you going for ?
i bet that is a lot of work ! do you already teach ?
oh yes ! i know your feeling . i see my dog as a child as well .
right ! it ' s like some kind of spiritual bond i think . it ' s a wonderful love to have !
that ' s touching , how is it these days ?
right , change is often di ##ffi ##cu ##ly
yeah i see no harm in that
yeah i know i don ##t get why people are that way
that would be great . good luck .
i really hope you get it . just stay confident .
congratulations ! i ' m so happy to hear that . you must be really excited !
holy mo ##ly ravi ##oli . 27 million ? you are rolling in the money .
that isn ##t good , were they true ?
that is terrible , is there someone above him you can go to ?
are you going to watch ?
no , i am not a big fan . which team do you like ?
how did he get hurt ?
that happened to me a few weeks ago . i was severely de ##hy ##dra ##ted and i faint ##ed . i hit the ground hard .
i am now . had to get stitch ##ed up .
oh dan ##g . do you think it was intentional ?
oh that stink ##s . i bet you were pretty mad ?
oh no , what did you buy ?
was it at least bud ##wei ##ser ?
sorry to hear that . do you think it was an intruder or just some prank ##ster ?
did they take your television ?
what stops you from going ? being busy with life , or just deep down you just do not want to go
sometimes life does have away with getting away from us
life is good when its like that
cher ##ish those moments
i don ' t blame you , i would have eaten some . did they notice ?
what type of candy was it ? i like sour patch and chocolate ##s .
good taste in candy ! i love reese ##s cups and hers ##hey bars . did you eat any of those ?
where are you going ?
what the heck is there ?
school can be al ot of work
i say go for it
i ' m sure she ' ll be flat ##tered if you ' re honest about how you ' re feeling !
i see , i hope it goes well for you !
what do you mean i think it is pretty good right now
yeah it always foe ##s in the end
that is terrible , i hope everything is ok
i am so sorry to hear that !
that ' s got to be annoying ! have you tried telling him to stop ?
maybe he should take up knitting - - or something else that would be a bit more quiet .
what was it ?
ah that is disgusting !
same here . are you living on a street where it is normal , as far as crime ?
dan ##g that is pretty scary though .
yeah , when i was younger i did some of that stuff as well . it ' s a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you don ' t remember doing .
well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked , you haven ' t lived .
o ##oo ##h like what kind of toys ?
wow that sounds like fun . i love canoe ##ing !
you ever think about moving ?
hope everything works out for you !
aw ##w , how long have you been together ?
that ' s amazing , keep up the good work !
why did you steal stuff ?
oh , that is rude , did you pay him back ?
nice ! i wish i was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are . but this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn . i haven ' t been the smart ##est about light ##ening the student loan debt burden while in school . good on you for looking ahead .
sometimes compromise ##s have to be made . but i have to say , i ' m impressed that you were that self - aware about the entire process , especially as a somewhat new adult . good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best . you sound like you ' ll be successful after college , especially because of how hard - working you are .
nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home ! its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it won ' t me on your mind once things start to get busy .
i completely understand that . its a good quality to have and is actually health ##ier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean .
someone broke in ?
good thinking . sounds like you should get yourself a new house
i agree , such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids , doing more harm than good in the long run .
i completely agree . unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation . . you know like climate change exists !
what kind of belt does he have ?
he ##h . that ##s really cool . i need to take self defense classes .
oh man i am jealous . are you going with anyone ?
dan ##g are you scared at all ? as far as doing it yourself ?
did you tell him he ate it in his sleep
i hope it tasted good !
why are you having to go again ?
probably from the crazy weather change . i hope they figure out what is causing the cough
oh no . well i hope that makes him better
i am sure he will be fine
i am happy for you . just keep going
that is a good thing ha
that ' s great . i don ' t have any tattoos myself , but a lot of people i know do . and it seems expensive . so i ' m glad he ' s not charging you much .
it seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars . i just don ' t have that kind of money .
i hope so , too . heart conditions can be scary ! do you have anyone closer to her that could check in ?
i know quite a few people that live their lives that way . i can see some of the reasons why a person would think that - - but it ' s still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love .
what is deserved or und ##ese ##r ##ved ?
i see , don ##t worry though . nowadays everyone finds an excuse to grab their pitchfork and point it at someone .
that ' s good timing at least . glad it didn ' t take too long .
what ended up being the problem ?
she sounds like a great girl . i am sure it will you sound like a happy couple .
hell ye ##a you sound like a genuine guy / girl . you know what is important , you will do fine .
why would your uncle be upset ? and how do you feel about the situation ? it sounds like there ' s a lot to un ##pack there .
i see . well , what ' s most important is your reaction and feelings around the situation , and what you plan to do about it . the only one that can affect the outcome is you . it ' s disappointing to deal with your uncle ' s ne ##gat ##ivity , but you can ' t let it distract you from moving in a positive direction .
that ' s great when life just feels right
i hope they do too ! i ' m happy for you
you must be feeling nos ##tal ##gic , maybe your kids will enjoy them
right , it ' s amazing how one thing can bring back so many memories
wow , that was super nice of him . you are lucky to have such a great dad .
that is a really great thing to hear . i hope you can find some way to pay back his kindness .
yeah but that is his ob
yeah im not sure i could every take that job
that sounds like an uncomfortable situation . what ended up happening ? i kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this , since there ' s usually alcohol involved .
oh , so you got involved ? were you trying to protect the kid ? if so , i can understand that , and that ' s noble . hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation .
yi ##kes , that ' s very di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful . i hope you told him how you feel about that .
that ' s good , at least he learned from that . i hope you guys are going strong now !
did your boyfriend notice ?
lo ##l . sometimes we got to do what we gotta do
did he ! you lucky dog !
well dan ##g that is awesome man , hopefully you can save up for your own lamb ##o .
were you actually under the influence ?
well that ' s great of her , we ' ve all done stuff .
that sucks , i ' m sorry to hear it . did they at least ask you first ?
at least they asked you , that ' s good . it will pass in no time and you ' ll be hanging soon i ' m sure ,
dan ##g , i guess she wasn ' t your friend after all
it is , glad you could figure out that she ' s not right to have in your life
oh no , did you get into trouble with your boss ?
ah ##h , that ' s too bad . just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions , maybe it won ' t be so bad .
i get that , nothing can beat home !
i am sorry to hear that , well maybe when you retire !
a good dentist is great to have !
did you have a lot of work done ?
what were the left overs ?
that sounds good !
sounds like quite the adventure you had . you must feel proud of yourself .
yes and hopefully no one was hurt .
nice you must feel pretty lucky
ha ##ha i wouldn ' t either if i had a porsche . . . . sounds like you need some kind of bomb shelter emergency parking
are you happy with it
i am glad for you then
a couch ! how was it hurting you ?
ha ##ha no worries . i though how could a couch could be scary . . . are you ok ? did you go to the doctor ?
oh , no ! it happens to the best of us .
luckily it is in the past , and i am sure no one remembers it !
that ' s good to hear ! what makes him so awesome ?
i ' m happy he ' s able to support his family through his work . i hope he enjoys it !
gross ! i would have been super mad if my cat did that ! what did you do ?
yeah , i would have done the some . hopefully that never happens to you again .
oh no , maybe try going to red ##dit and ask people what to do in your city !
ha ##ha ##ha , me too , it ' s such a time sink . this week when it was down for a couple hours i really felt like i had nothing else to brows ##e .
uh oh ! how was it driving weird ?
yi ##kes ! my old ford focus had a similar issue . it turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire .
oh yeah ? you applying to a new job ?
oh how cool ! well good luck my friend ! ! ! what do you want to study ?
what does it not do right ?
that ' s so lame , you should maybe tell your boss about it though .
oh wow , that isn ' t good . hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok !
is the kid ok ? he won ' t have his license for a few more years probably now .
so exciting ! do you have any special gift in mind for them ?
that ##s alright . as long as you two are happy with each other , that ##s the most important thing !
i hope you don ' t feel jealous of your friend . did he accept the job ?
seems like you have a trust ##worthy friend for life ! i hope you cher ##ish this friendship .
don ' t you just hate that ? !
just remember , it is probably a female mosquito . they are the ones interested in your blood . not the males .
sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends ?
good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence . join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends .
oh no ! are you ok ?
ye ##a i would be too ! that is a horrible person .
aw ##w i ' m sorry . maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girl ##y shows . my husband is in the military and gone a lot so i feel for you .
aw ##w thank you , means a lot !
i think if it ' s done without care then yes , care for what she would feel that is . maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you ' re feeling , but it ' s up to you !
right , but deep down i ' m sure you know that you don ' t need a relationship to feel content !
that was very nice of him .
wow , that is a wonderful keeps ##ake from him . i bet you really cher ##ish it .
that ' s nice . was it a special occasion or anything ?
what did you have to eat ?
what kind of memories
those were good years for sure
oh wow , i ' m sorry to hear that ! loss can be hard : (
i ' m sorry ! take the time to gr ##ie ##ve and be there for your friend .
cong ##rat ##s ! that sounds like a good movie !
i saw it , and it was a good movie , i don ##t usually watch marvel films
sorry to hear that . you must be going through a tough time .
you should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind , and when you ' re ready , adopt a puppy from your local shelter .
hey , congratulations . that must have been a lot of hard work . i wish i put more time into extra ##cu ##rricular stuff like that . it ' s a good look in the future . especially the debate team - - you develop so many good life skills with that !
i bet . . . that ' s a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and hon ##ing your skills . i ' m sure it ' s a lot of positive int ##ang ##ible ##s developed that you will re ##ap the awards from later on in life .
glad to hear it ! health is such an important thing , and the more you look after your body , the better it will treat you .
i agree , now you will financially and physically secure . all the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs .
uh oh ! are you going to ask him to pay for it ? or at least fix it ?
might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff , unfortunately .
that is strange . did you like the gift ?
that is for sure ! someone must really like you !
oh my , sorry to hear that . how is he holding up ?
i am sure it is . just need to give him time and support right now .
what are those ? your grades ?
math was always my least favorite . are you british ?
did you find out why he was fleeing the draft ?
that ' s a bit much of him to dodge his country when they needed him don ' t you think ?
that is awesome ! i bet you are so proud
that should mo ##tiv ##ate him to keep up the good work !
were you playing in a team ?
i understand
i ' m glad you ' re taking it seriously , parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids ' lives , or the worst , but i ' m sure you ' re doing your best
hope you ' re enjoying it !
that ' s great ! what percentage are you thinking you ' ll be getting ?
that ' s really good then . i ' m sure it will help you financially
how ' d it end up after the fact ?
i hope it all went well for you .
that ' s always fun , to see those random memories crop up when you least expect . what kind of board games were they ?
i ' ve played monopoly before , of course . i wonder why that ' s the game everyone ' s played during their childhood . . . but yeah , risk i ' ve never played , dunn ##o why . maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved , for old time ' s sake .
that is funny i feel like someone should have said something though
that is great well know you know what not to do on a plane lo ##l
how long have you had it ?
is this recent . do you know why ?
wow that ' s lucky .
oh i cot ya . i am glad you have your stuff .
which six flags did you go to ?
i live right by that one !
nice , such relics of the past really hit you with a wave of nostalgia . did the gear still fit you ?
oh i see , that is to be expected . at least you still have the gear !
oh nice , how did it go ?
that ##s great ! glad it worked out for you and your dog was safe ! i hear so many bad stories about people lo ##osing pets .
ha ##ha i bet it wasn ' t that bad . . . . was it
ok now i ' m curious . . . what the hell did you do
you must feel so content at this point . it must have taken a lot of hard work to get to this point !
i am glad that it is finally paying off ! keep it up because independence is the sweet ##est thing .
that is unfortunate , is it possible to go through chemotherapy again ?
i hope everything works out for you
that is so sad . dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
i am so sorry for your loss , within time you will heal . just try to cher ##ish the memories that you was left with , think about all the good times
yeah , i have a dough ##ter as well and understand . i guess kids will be kids !
the things they do make no sense . kid logic !
uh oh , do you think you were being row ##dy ?
it ' s ok . everyone can chang ein life . do you drink too much ?
oh my , sounds like you have the dread ##ed roommate situation on your hands . have you tried talking to him ?
i see , if you ' re in college , try talking to your resident advisor about it .
that will be nice . are you going to have some free time ?
you could get a nice dinner with that . have fun .
is the car terribly damaged ?
i hope it will be ok . were you late for your work ?
that sucks , it takes so long for them to arrive !
hope everything works out for you !
i feel that , even though i prefer winter
i get that , but all seasons are good , you miss the ones that it is not
is that a game ?
no , i ' m sure i ' m a bit older than you .
you can train and get better
i thin y ##you ##ca you just have to believe in yu ##rse ##f
why is that ?
i get that , too bad we cannot ref ##und movies
nice ! you must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone !
he must be for his children to seem him as an inspiration !
oh god ! is everyone you care about ok ?
man , i am so sorry , i could not imagine .
do you find value in them still ?
i think you should keep them instead of throwing them away .
how did he get it ?
i hope it wasn ' t too painful for him and he di ##sin ##fect ##ed and bandage ##d that wound up .
oh my god ! are you ok ? was anyone home ? did they take anything important ?
that ' s weird . i am happy you have your posse ##sions .
who is it ?
i bet she is ! i am so glad you get to see her . mom ' s are awesome !
was the fire set by someone or an accident ?
that ' s horrible , i am sorry !
that is good . it is nice to focus on the positive ##s
i am glad to hear that . i hope it keeps staying that way
u ##gh teenagers can be so troubles ##ome some times ! i hope you made him realize what he did was wrong .
yu ##p , but what i don ' t like about that age is having to stay up all night !
helping animals sometimes brings great pleasure . you did a good deed
awe . ya it doesn ' t take much to get attached to something that you are nursing back to health
that sounds like a cool place to go ! can you bring your cat there ?
that is so cool ! we adopted a cat from a shelter and he is the best cat !
nice ! you must be so proud ! how old is he ?
what an angel ! i ' m looking forward to starting my own family too .
what did they do ?
e ##w ##w ##w . adults should know better than that . i think i would have been grossed out
that ' s wonderful ! i bet it was a nice trip down memory lane .
memories are the most precious thing we can have in life i think .
wow that ' s been a long time . did you two have a good time together ?
that ' s great that you two rec ##onne ##cted like it ! i ' m happy for you .
what did you do ?
it is ok . most spider are not dangerous . what is it a big one ?
what did your friends do ?
on no . was this at a public place ?
oh no , when can you take it again ?
dan ##g that is unfortunate !
hey that ' s great ! how long has it been ?
dan ##g . i bet you ' re gonna have some good times together !
what ##s going to happen ?
oh go ##sh , i think it was just a tree falling i bet .
oh i hope you get it ! it can really help out or just be a sp ##lu ##rge
definitely , it ' s good to work for a company that does that too
a ' b ' ? hmm , well you know how it is , hope your stomach feels better !
you ' ll be fine , next time just look and see how clean their bathrooms are , it gives you a good idea how their kitchens are !
that ' s wonderful . i also love the holidays . it ' s the perfect time for families .
sounds like heaven ! i am also looking forward to them too .
that ' s awesome . you must be so proud of him .
the l ##sat is no joke . he must have studied very hard .
what kind of cup ##cake do you like from there ?
those are so ta ##sty , are you excited ?
awesome ! i hope you do well ! when do you take it ?
you will do great , just stay confident !
communication is key , have you talked to him about it ?
age doesn ' t am ##tter , show him you are ready .
oh no , next time you should bring a friend to be safe .
it ' s okay , you got out fine this time !
what does he normally talk about ?
oh yeah , that really is a waste of time
nice ! did you have a good time ?
that ##s good . stay confident and let things happen naturally !
gr ##atz . what ' s the secret ?
good to hear , glad you guys are happy !
was he drinking heavy ? i ' m sorry hope the night wasn ' t too bad .
i ' m sorry to hear that ! ha ##ha guess he ' s not invited next time !
don ' t be ! you are awesome the way you are !
our imperfect ##ions help us stay unique ! do worry yourself with that , there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us ! just keep being awesome !
hey . . . congratulations to you on both fronts ! that sounds like double good news . it was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally cong ##rat ##ulate you .
well , it ' s good to have you join the workforce in society . you seem like a positive person who can contribute well . hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard - earned degree .
ah ##h , is he a trouble ##maker right now ? most of the time , it ' s the friends they hang out with . young people are easily influenced by the people around them .
yes , he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviour ##s . you need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he won ' t have time to do anything bad .
did you get hurt ?
yeah , gotta be careful one day you might hurt yourself pretty bad
nice , what year ?
dan ##g , that must look great !
im sorry to hear ##you were home ##les
that is great cong ##rat !
interesting . . . you sure it wasn ' t fish that washed up on the shore
got ##cha . . hope that didn ' t ruin your whole day
why , what happened to make you feel that
nice , i never understood why that ' s em ##bara ##ssing ha ##ha
oh wow that sucks ! hope it wasn ' t too em ##bara ##ssing !
oh wow i ' m sorry ! that ' s not cool , they would be hurt if people were laughing at them
that ' s great ! where are they working ?
that ' s got to be frustrating . have you thought of maybe working at the same place ?
that is scary ! hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town
that is horrible ! i bet a little part of you was scared
oh wow ! that is intense ! i am glad he didn ' t get kicked out !
it sounds like it !
that is amazing . sounds like you have a really good support system .
i have a few . it really does help when times are not so great .
that is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories !
now you can carry on that tradition .
i do too . i wish we could have fall weather longer .
same here and next thing you know it ' s a blizzard .
oh what happened instead ? did your friends throw you a party ?
wow ! what a great surprise ! you should thank the person that planned it !
that is awesome ! i cannot wait until my student loans are paid off !
i am happy for you !
oh , don ' t be ! just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in .
i see , think of it as having a conversation with a friend . it will make it easier !
they do have nice bags ! i hope you are able to get one !
they are , but if you save up a little at a time , it won ' t be that bad !
nice ! how are you celebrating for him ?
so cute ! take a lot of photos so he ' ll be able to see them in the future !
yu ##m ! su ##shi is so good , i ' m sure you ' ll enjoy it ! i like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll .
i ' m sure you will ! maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for rec ##ome ##nda ##tions .
where are you going ? i would say if your gut is telling you that it is not good then i would suggest listening to it
lo ##l . oh . coaster ##s are fun . very exciting !
a " really nice " piece of hair ? yi ##kes . did you send it back ?
well good . hopefully you got your food re - made though .
oh dan ##g , that is too bad . can you guys video call ?
oh ok , hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions .
i ' m right there with you . i ' ve always been a home - body . i don ' t like going out as much . sometimes people say millennia ##ls and technology have disconnected people too much . . that could be true . but at least we ' re comfortable doin it .
absolutely . i ' m the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit , but get drained by them . i think that ' s getting more and more common for others . could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick !
that is awesome , i was an early reader as well ! that is a great accomplishment ! !
i hope they both keep the love for reading and writing !
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! are you able to be up for another one soon ?
oh great ! that ' s sooner than in my company . i know you ' ll get one . just keep working hard and good luck !
it happens to the best of us ! i know the lady understands !
maybe you ' ll never see her again !
sorry to hear that , i know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities !
yes , and you will succeed eventually .
do you have some uncertainty in you life right now ?
that is really tough . are you in a career now ?
do you have any opportunity for an internship of some sort ? the career advisers from your school may be able to help .
i did that myself , and i can tell you it was well worth it . i am much happier now than i ever was . i wish you very good luck on whatever you decide to do !
as in living alone or single ?
oh no . that ##s terrible .
oh wow , i ' m sorry to hear that ! put your leg up and relax this weekend !
i hope your insurance does too ! just take care of you ##sel ##f and i hope you feel better soon !
that sounds really frustrating to deal with . you sound like you ' re self - aware and anticipating the problem , though . perhaps you ' ve already started preparing to look elsewhere ?
well , luckily google is so helpful these days . there ' s tons of template ##s out there . it ' s kind of annoying to deal with , especially because it ' s being motivated by your company possibly disappearing . . but it won ' t take long at all to craft a good one , especially because often ##time ##s the shorter they are , the better
nice . did you find a good hair ##dre ##sser ?
that is great .
i am sorry to hear that ! my dog is a part of the family , so i understand . i hope everything is okay .
it is scary to think about , i hope for the best !
what did you do ?
that is a cool job
that ' s great . where are you going ?
sounds like a great trip . i hope you guys have a fun time .
that is exciting . when is she due ?
yes it is ! is she having a boy or a girl ?
aw ##w ##w ! congratulations ! i hope everything goes smoothly .
i totally understand . life can sometimes seem overwhelming . i have learned to stop , take a deep breath , and do one thing at a time .
it ' s just a way to calm the body and the mind . it is so easy to fall into the trap of anxiety . but falling there doesn ' t accomplish a thing . take a breath , focus on one small success , then move to the next .
yi ##kes ! bet the car payment is not worth it . lo ##l
sometimes jealousy can become us . but most times it does not pay to be that way , cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right
wo ##ah , hope she doesn ' t report you ! j ##k
i see , hope she is able to understand !
what are you applying for ?
that sounds interesting , when do you learn if you got in ?
what game and what kind of award >
way to go ! that is a great accomplishment !
oh wow that is so exciting ! i ' m sure you are excited to move in .
aw ##w that ' s great ! i have two dogs , they become part of the family ! enjoy your new house : )
you sound very content . what makes you happy ?
well that is a good reason . you are blessed .
oh no , i would have had a heart attack .
sell the house !
nice , how was it ?
hope you ' re all right !
are you doing the cheese ##cake for your family ?
that is great .
that ' s really nice ! you should show her you appreciate her . maybe cook her dinner !
ah ##h yes , that ' s very nice too , good for her ! you guys have a happy marriage .
u ##gh that must so inc ##on ##ven ##ient and uncomfortable !
i can relate , i get red face when ever i have to come in ##front of the class to present .
oh go ##sh , is he going to take you to the superb ##ow ##l at least ?
just one ticket , that sounds lonely for him .
nice ! i want to take my daughter when she is older . did you go to disneyland or world ?
california is fun to visit as well ! glad you all had fun .
aw ##w that is great !
yeah my mom did that for me a few years back
oh naughty . did anyone see you ?
well it ' s not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe ! i am sure it will be fine .
are you making a trip to see your family ?
great . it is always good to see your family . is it very far ?
that would definitely be a difficult thing to find out . how did you find out ?
wow . that is really horrible . i am so sorry that happened to you .
ha ##ha . . i feel like that ' s almost a rite of passage when going to water parks . i ' ve had that happen , too . hopefully it wasn ' t too traumatic for you . i almost lost my glasses once , too ! now that was really scary
that ' s the spirit . it ' s good that you don ' t take yourself too seriously . heck , my roommate walked in on me doing some " self - pleasure " just yesterday . . i used to think that was my worst nightmare , but in the moment i just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster
i hate when that happens ! the same thing happened to me when i moved out of my apartment . they kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet .
mine hadn ' t been replaced in 6 years , i found that out after the fact .
