A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross. 	Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.

Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!

Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined! __eou__ Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?! 	Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!

"I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. 	That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?
"I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. __eou__ That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make.

I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet. 	Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.

I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside. 	Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.

We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.

He kept doing drugs, and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do. 	It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...

Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking... __eou__ Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk. 	You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.
