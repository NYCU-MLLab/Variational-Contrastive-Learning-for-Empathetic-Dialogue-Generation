My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a "regular" income. 	I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better.

Sounds a bit scary

I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!
Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store! 	Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.

Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!) 	Actually I'm not, but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations, I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day.
I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered "better". 	I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas

I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-) 	Baby belugas are cute, but not as cute as your baby!

I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.
This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt 	That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten, so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.

I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting. 	Did it go your way?

Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating! __eou__ I hate traffic too, it makes me angry __eou__ Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes 	People are so rude when they drive these days
The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house. 	I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.
The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house. __eou__ I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie. __eou__ And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too. 	That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me, I was too curious to not see the others.
My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters. 	She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.

Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown. __eou__ Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight? __eou__ I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days. 	Oh, I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.
I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out 	Put what word ? You mean published the info?
I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out __eou__ Put what word ? You mean published the info? __eou__ Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one! 	So what breed did you get ?
When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them 	I would be too! You did what you had to do!

My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him. 	You shouldn't, because that is  a very stressful job

Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood __eou__ I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot? __eou__ I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had.

Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!

I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good. 	I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.

My parents keep taking my money __eou__ That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it?? __eou__ They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it. 	Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.
So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a "mommy" will come along to clean up after them?! 	LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the " You are an adult not a child" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences.

(And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?) 	Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol

Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that! 	yeah that's tough.

I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache. 	That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint.
Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles.

It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever! __eou__ ewww! that is just super gross dude! __eou__ I know!

I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding! 	I would love to have that tv

I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done. 	Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.
I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done. __eou__ Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner. __eou__ Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous! 	That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been. 	That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?

I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely. 	That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?

If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?! 	I know the feeling.

I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me! 	Oh man! What happened to your hip?
I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me! __eou__ Oh man! What happened to your hip? __eou__ I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around.

If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..

Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else. 	Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!

Writing speeches makes me nervous __eou__ I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst! __eou__ Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience 	Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.

My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error! __eou__ Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers? __eou__ Not sure yet.

I really hope he doesn't win in 2020. __eou__ We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways. 	He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!

Or both! __eou__ No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance 	Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)
I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight. 	That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.
I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight. __eou__ That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate. __eou__ Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad! 	There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)
I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive. 	I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?
I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive. __eou__ I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control? __eou__ I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of. 	That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!
Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing. 	wow, it must have been quite an experience

So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing. __eou__ wow, it must have been quite an experience __eou__ It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek! 	My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe

The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes. 	10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own.

Did you to it? __eou__ Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed. 	So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did?
My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there! 	You must be so proud!

We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow! 	Oh that is nice, will you be going skiing?

I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary. 	That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.
I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary. __eou__ That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises. __eou__ Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact. 	I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things. 	oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?
I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things. __eou__ oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope? __eou__ Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me. 	Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.
I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car.

I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn. 	Ouch, I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.

I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses. 	Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))

(And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-)) __eou__ Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha 	As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!
I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs. 	It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?

I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly. 	What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?

Not too impressed, frankly. __eou__ What did you do after waiting for 2 hours? __eou__ I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship! 	Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.

I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him. 	Maybe not a true friend after all.
I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck. 	I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!
I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck. __eou__ I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?! __eou__ She won $5,000 and never offered to share. 	That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in. 	Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?
I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in. __eou__ Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart? __eou__ I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot. 	Well done! You should be proud.
I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed. 	If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?
I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed. __eou__ If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right? __eou__ Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on 	Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?
I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me! 	What did they or the person do to you?

Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me! __eou__ What did they or the person do to you? __eou__ Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch. 	Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them.
My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better. 	That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?

Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did? __eou__ Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away? 	No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.
I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well. 	Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?

What happened? __eou__ There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties. 	I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!
Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad! 	Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.
Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad! __eou__ Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there. __eou__ Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe 	Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!

Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!
I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful. 	I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad, especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.

Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo. 	I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.
My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion. 	That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?

I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times. __eou__ What types of tv shows do you like to watch? __eou__ Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before. 	Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?

I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know? 	Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.

He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset. __eou__ That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. __eou__ Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.

I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her. 	That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though.

I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down, too. Good luck

My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her. 	That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.

I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.
I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again. 	My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport, albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.

Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again! 	Well, often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself, at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens, motivation starts to become real easy to get.

I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything 	Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?

I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled. 	Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway.

I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control! 	It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.

I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals! __eou__ Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. __eou__ They're filthy, ignorant bullies.

Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I. __eou__ Oh, I hate it when that happens.

It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something. __eou__ Does it look like a space ship? __eou__ Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas? 	I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time

My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself. __eou__ Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down? __eou__ She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away. 	I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too.
I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful. 	That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.

Place smells awful. __eou__ That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there. __eou__ I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired.

I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather. __eou__ I bet you are, that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter? __eou__ I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it. 	How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency, and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous, and proud in a vicarious kind of way.
I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year. 	Well good luck with that!
I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year. __eou__ Well good luck with that! __eou__ Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it. 	What are you studying?

Hope you got a lot of work done.
In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever. 	Goodness, you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.

Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you. __eou__ Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too. 	I'm so very sorry for your loss, I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.
A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it. 	It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately.

I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes __eou__ Did you find any good companies. __eou__ a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is 	Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.
I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick! 	It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!
I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick! __eou__ It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help! __eou__ Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house. 	I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.
The other night I had a panic attack out the blue 	That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?
The other night I had a panic attack out the blue __eou__ That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you? __eou__ Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about. 	Are you able to do anything to prevent them?

I really hope that you find him. __eou__ We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend. 	Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them.
I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing. 	Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?

Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms? __eou__ That's just it. We didn't really "break up" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough. 	That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.
Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight. 	How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward, as the saying goes.

I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me. 	Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.
I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me. __eou__ Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning. __eou__ No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it. 	Oh gosh, that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!
I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air 	Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.

My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep! __eou__ Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at? __eou__ People walking on the bike trail behind our house.

I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool! 	Happens to everybody. My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important, that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case, too!

One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor. 	oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.

I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories. 	Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.
